Jackie is the personal trainer to the stars that has her show on Bravo called "Work Out" (if I am not mistaken) and not only would she beat the s'hit out of Rosie, but, tell her to get her fat a'ss on a treadmill and lose a good 20lbs!

question_title: Why did Itachi Uchiha kill his clan? [SEP] question_content: I'm just asking away. I know the answer but I'm just doing this 'cuz I'm bored. [SEP] best_answer: Noted even within the Bingo Book (a list of powerful ninja who have been marked for assassination because of their crimes), Uchiha Itachi is an S-Class criminal and a Konoha Nukenin. He graduated at the top of his Academy class at age 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chūnin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions and the English Anime) squad leader at the age of only 13.\n\nHe left Konoha about five years prior to the setting of Naruto, after slaying his whole clan, sparing only Uchiha Sasuke, his little brother. At 17, he was feared by even Orochimaru. He is now currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planned to use Itachi's body as a new container for his soul, but Itachi's power had grown to such a frightening extent that Orochimaru dared not carry out his plan, and decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with the younger Sasuke instead.\n\nThe reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left only his brother Sasuke alive, still remains unclear. When questioned by Sasuke, he replied "To test my 'Utsuwa'." In Japanese, 'Utsuwa' (器) can mean "Vessel," or "Container," but it can also mean "Ability," or "Tool." Orochimaru uses this word to refer to the bodies he takes over with his Fushi Tensei no Jutsu ("Living Corpse Reincarnation"). In this respect, Itachi's words can mean anything from him having a past connection with Orochimaru, to him simply wanting to test his own power, or to his plans to join Akatsuki and forsake past relations. To make matters even more ambiguous, the first person pronoun Itachi used can also be used as a vulgar second person pronoun. So he could also have meant that he wanted to test Sasuke's 'Utsuwa,' although this is unlikely, given his previous remarks about his 'Utsuwa'.\n\nHe was until recently the only known person who possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a different-looking Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga, but to what extent they share abilities is unknown. Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total three. It is unknown who the second person Itachi is referring to, as this statement was made before Kakashi obtained his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n\nDespite being the murderer of his entire clan as well as his best and closest friend, a top member of Akatsuki, and a shinobi capable of putting an adult shinobi to sleep at a mere glance; Itachi is by no means a cold blooded murderer looking for any excuse to kill someone in their way. When Sarutobi Asuma and Yūhi Kurenai stood between him and the way to his goal (Uzumaki Naruto), he did not kill Kurenai when given the chance, though he did wound her enough for her to remember it; as well as trap her within her own Genjutsu.

question_title: Is X Factor in danger of killing real music? [SEP] question_content: Is the industry in general stopping real talent emerging with its obsession for boy band covers and x factor style 'pop stars'? [SEP] best_answer: There have always been performers who don't write their own songs the only difference now is we get to see the selection process (all be it done in a more showbiz way). The only effect it might be having is the same as any reality tv show in as much as some young people today want instant fame without any of the hard work and see these shows as their chance to go to the Ivy and live the lifestyle that really doesn't exsist. It very rarely works out for these people.\n\nI think there will always be room for real talent and it will always be recognised (whether you write your own stuff or just perform other people's songs). These programmes are just a flash in the pan in terms of how the music business operates. They're this generation's must see telly, that's all. Real talent will always survive.	Entertainment & Music

I consider him to have the most intriguing back story, of regretting his duty in the Republican Guard, and yet knowing it is part of him that can never leave him. Like all the other characters, he has a light and a dark side, however, acknowledging his dark side, almost blends it in with the light. In addition, he does show humanity towards the other survivors, as shown with trying to get the signal, his forgiveness of Ana-Lucia, and his speech to Charlie about the others.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Does anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? [SEP] question_content: I was watching the band Rush’s 30th anniversary concert last night on VH1 Classic. I’ve heard some of their songs as I was growing up. (“Limelight” is now one of my favorite Rush songs) They were performing their hit “Tom Sawyer”. I think the music is really good on this one too, but I started thinking about the lyrics.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? They are rather abstract but there has to be some meaning there. [SEP] best_answer: I think it's a song about a basic modern guy. His options are wide open, he's confident. He's got the world at his feet. He's a free thinker and his opinions can't be bought or sold. \n\nA modern day warrior\nMean, mean stride\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nMean, mean pride\n\nThough his mind is not for rent\nDon't put him down as arrogant\nHis reserve, a quiet defense\nRiding out the day's events\nThe river\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the mist, catch the myth\nCatch the mystery, catch the drift\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his skies are wide\n\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the space he invades\nHe gets by on you\n\nNo his mind is not for rent\nTo any god or government\nAlways hopeful, yet discontent\nHe knows changes aren't permanent\nBut change is\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the witness, catch the wit\nCatch the spirit, catch the spit\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his eyes are wide\n\nExit the warrior\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the energy you trade\nHe gets right on to the friction of the day	Entertainment & Music

question_title: help with writing a resume? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.	Business & Finance

They said I received the check to cover the processing fees. I just jumped on an impulse, now I am worrying that I could be charged with bank fraud.  Can I? They said once check clears to give them a call. I have been having alot of money problems and I thought that finally I could get out of them with this check. [SEP] best_answer: If you deposited a check thinking it was a real check, then you did not commit check fraud. If the bank cleared it then to me that is an indication that it is a real check. The bank is the one who should be able to tell yo if it is real. You got scammed, don't EVER PAY for a prize, or a JOB, in advance! They're always scams!  Talk to a lawyer ASAP!	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I get over my fear of flying.  Have tried alcohol, drugs, pschology and hypnotherapy but no luck yet!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I will be honest.  After a very bad flight 30 years ago, on which I was scared out of my wits, I swore I would never fly again.   This continued until about eight years ago when my best friend died home in Ireland.  There was no other way of getting to his funeral other than flying.  I did so and I can only say that I now feel sorry for all the years I have wasted driving long distances, using Ferries when I could have been to far away places enjoying my holidays better than in fact I did.  I fly everywhere now.\nI discovered that the trick was to face my fear.  I forced myself to sit next to a window and watched everything from take off to the flying and up to the landing.  I know that what I say may seen to you to be of no use in your position but I would say take a short flight and face your fears. Good luck.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: Is this website worth keeping on the web?\nhttp://www.trainingtrix.com [SEP] best_answer: If you are asking this question because you are not satisfied with the performance of your website in the Adsense program, I suggest you read the article "Contextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies?" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm . Some sites by their very topic and nature do well with Adsense, but some are really a poor fit.\n\nMy suggestion is to increase the number of ad units you have on your page. Your homepage only has a leaderboard, yet your page is VERY LONG. Have another unit in the middle and another at the bottom. You can also add an Ad Links to your 3 ad formats.	Business & Finance

question_title: How to be popular? [SEP] question_content: I'm not most popular at my school but I wish I was. Please, how to be popular? [SEP] best_answer: Popularity is merely nothing more than a contest. If you wish to engage in such simple, closed minded, shallow activity then change yourself. I remember high school (well, some of it) and all the most "popular" people were always striving to be someone or something they were not. Constantly concerned with their appearance, concerned with the way others viewed them. And worse yet, they were quite the epitomy of phoney. In my opinion is was sad, pathetic and disheartening. \nIf you wish to have more friends then take the advice of liveevilone666 above. Open up more, talk often, ask questions, smile A LOT. \nDo not though, change who you are. You are an individual who deserves respect and kindness just as much as anyone else. If the "popular" people don't see you such then it's their loss...not your's. \nBe yourself...love yourself exactly as you are. If and when you do that, you'll be amazed how many more people will be simply clammering for your attention.	Business & Finance

question_title: Why does college education mean little when looking for a job; everyone seems to value experience more? [SEP] question_content: I graduated from a good university in August. And although my major is in art, I did achieve high academic honors in college and in high school. I have posted my resume on many websites, I have a couple of recruiters, and I visited with  my college counslers (they were of the least help). In an attempt to stay well educated, I read Forbes, Inc., and several newspapers; I am determined to achieve success within any career. \n\nEven the people who give me the interview opportunity seem to say I do not have enough experience. I want experience, how do I get experience if no one will hire me? I've focused my attention on a wide variety of career fields, and so far I have turned up empty. What can I do to get my foot in the door? [SEP] best_answer: You might be viewing your degree in the wrong light.  How people see a degree is that someone can commite to something. \n\n Your next step is to focus on what you want to do and even volenteer your time to get just a little experience and that can make more of a difference that you might think.\n\nAt your old college you can go back and see about helping out with things in your degree field and that is viable experience as well.

question_title: why is it called quitting cold turkey? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One site states, "The state addicts are in when withdrawing from drug addition, especially heroin. Origin: In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.idiomsite.com/coldturkey.htm)\n\nAnother site explains, "This phrase meaning "without preparation" dates to 1910. The use in relation to withdrawal from an addictive substance (originally heroin) dates to around 1922. The derivation is from the idea that cold turkey is a food that requires little preparation in the kitchen. So to quit like cold turkey is to do so suddenly and without preparation. It is also boosted by the image of the pallid flesh of a cold, dead, plucked turkey. In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.allexperts.com/previousqv.asp?QuestionID=2633904)\n\nYet another site says, "'Cold turkey' is actually based on another colloquial phrase, "to talk turkey" (sometimes "to talk cold turkey"), meaning to face unpleasant truths squarely. It's not entirely clear how turkeys came to be associated with honesty and straightforward confrontation of difficulties, but it may simply be that turkey farmers were renowned at one time for their lack of pretense and blunt speech."

question_title: Why do really wealthy people get tax breaks, whereas 'normal' people have to pay it all? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'll assume that by wealthy, you mean people earning above $95,000 and are therefore on the top tax rate of 47%. Therefore, everytime you give them a tax break (such as a deduction for donations), they will save $47 in tax for every $100. For the normal person who is on the 30% bracket, they will only save $30 in tax for every $100 they donate. Tax breaks for the wealthy tend to more beneficial because they are already paying a high amount of tax. Tax breaks for the normal person don't look so impressive, because they pay a lower rate.\n\nIt may be because these 'normal' tax breaks are so unimpressive that the government of the day knows that people don't care on election day about the 'sandwich and a milkshake' tax break.

question_title: Is "Work from Home" advertisements for real? [SEP] question_content: There are many advertisements which promise thousands by working from. I wonder if they are really credible. If they really are, can anyone give me a realiable directions to such work? [SEP] best_answer: Most are scams.  If there was a reliable list of the good ones, no one would ever go to a regular job again.  Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n    * What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n    * Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n    * Who will pay me?\n    * When will I get my first paycheck?\n    * What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n    * What will I get for my money?

question_title: What percentage of property value must a monthly rental payment be to make a rental investment worthwhile? 1%? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends greatly on where you are. If the property is in an area where real-estate is growing at 20% annually, then you can even pay people to stay in your place and make a nice return. However, if you expect the property to appreciate only 2% a year, then you will need to charge a lot more.\n\nWhat you need to do is figure out what your annual costs are (cost of capital, taxes, insurance, maintanence, etc) then subtract how much you think the property will appreciate in that year, and the difference will be the minimum you could charge for yearly rent to simply break even (divide by twelve for monthly). To that, add whatever amount you feel the market would bear to provide profit and cover any eventual risks or times of vacancies.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: I'm 49 with no qualifications and my only official experience is in retail and i've already been made redundent in that area and don't want to go back, what should i do? [SEP] best_answer: You should get a job, any even if its back to retail, because it would show that you are still working hard, because people don't want people who sit a home doing nothing, and while your working, in your free time look for a job that provides traing, where you don't need any experience or qualifications, because by your age and if your working already they'd think your responsible and hard working and give you a chance.

question_title: In a corporation, what's the difference between a president, a secretarty, a CEO, and an owner? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the corporation.  The CEO is typically above the President of an organization, usually works with the Board of Directors.  A secretary is typically very far down an organizationla list, and aides the white and blue collar workers in their tasks.  (some firms use the term Secretary instead of Vice President, but this is rare).  For a corporation, the owner is not a single person, but several people.  When you hear about a person having stock in a company, that person essentially 'owns' a piece of the company.  So the owners are a primary source of financing for the corporation because they supply the money (through stocks), but owners have actually very little to do with the day-to-day operations of the firm.

question_title: did you participate in boycott yesterday Walmart from donating a large amount of money to the gay community? [SEP] question_content: What i dont understand why do business have to give money to these groups at ths same time they wont pay their employees better. Its kinda like blackmail ,this is the kind of crap thats hurting this country. If you belong to a certain group you should be able to support it yourself if you believe in that much.Thats what my religion does.There are many familes that cant make ends meet they have children without medical insurance & companies give to a community that knows very little about providing for their family its all about me me me !! [SEP] best_answer: Actually the money goes into funding to generate awareness and acceptance(ie commercials and public speakers)I feel that if a buisness wants to set up a booth or donation box for any reason that is their porogative they dont tell you that you have to put money in its your choice.  I do believe tolorence in any form wether it be for gay, violence, or even religious tolerence is and should still be supported and every religion has some sort of donation system and some of that comes from other odinary people that are not apart of your congregation ie garage sales with donation boxes. so get off your high horse and just because you dont like gays does not mean you should condemn the world to your beliefs.

[SEP] question_content: I don't have socio security number yet, because I just aply to permanent resident. [SEP] best_answer: If you have a bank account-depending how long you've had it and if you have a job(employment) go to the same bank and apply for the loan.  Since this is a small amount and you can afford payments of approx 100. per month--maybe less but only the Loan Officer at your bank can tell you-that is your best bet to get the loan and  you're also establishing good solid credit by paying off a bank loan. Whatever you do-do not get the loan from anyone where you'll have a high finance charge.  Talk to your bank and even if for some reason they can't they can advise if you can get loan and what to avoid doing--if you've applied bring proof and show to bank officer, bring all paperwork that shows you're here legally.

question_title: What are some drawbacks and benefits of bilingual education in California? [SEP] question_content: The question is referring to grades K-12. [SEP] best_answer: May/June 1998\n\nBilingual Education and California's "English for the Children" Initiative: Researchers, Practitioners, and Policymakers Debate the Issues\n\nOn June 2, California voters will decide whether to eliminate bilingual education in their state. Proposition 227, also known as the "English for the Children" initiative or the Unz initiative after the name of its chief sponsor, proposes replacing current bilingual programs with a maximum of one year of "sheltered English immersion" (see "Models of Language Instruction"). In this case, parents would have to explicitly ask for their children to be placed in native-language programs.\n\nIf Proposition 227 passes, it could lead to a seismic shift in educating the nation's largest population of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. With 1.4 million LEP students in the state, California is home to nearly half of the nation's population of young English learners. In March 1998, the state board of education gave school districts local control of decisions about educating LEP students. However, if Proposition 227 passes, it would override any other provisions.\n\nIn an effort to advance the dialogue about how best to educate students who do not speak English, the Harvard Education Letter asked some key supporters and opponents of the California ballot initiative to share their perspectives:	Education & Reference

What is so hard about this even after we have spent two weeks on learning how. [SEP] best_answer: To be able to use a tool to accomplish a task, you need to know about the task.  Ignorance of the task is one fundamental problem that instructors trying to introduce the concept of functions have to face.\n\nA good way to do it is take up a task (say calculating interest), let them know the parameters involved (what we call variables in math).. and how the result is derived manually.  \n\nNow, if they are made to understand that excel/spreadsheet is a tool that would enable them to accomplish that same task .... may be they would be able to get along .....

[SEP] best_answer: The only thing positive that I can say about my school experiences is that they have strengthened my resolve that no child of mine will ever attend a public school and that I will homeschool if at all possible.\n\nEverything I have learned academically has been learned either from my parents (reading, early math skills, and the ability to engage in logical argument) or from self study (everything else).  \n\nMost of what I learned at school was social and most of it was wrong. \n\nMy school experiences taught me that to be accepted by society you have to look and think like everyone else.  They taught me that I am living in a world where you have to live in a constant mood of defensiveness and that you always work with people who are about your age, from the same part of town, and that most of those people will be living at my economic level and be of the same race and nationality. Finally I learned that if you believe in God than you are wrong and will be punished for practicing your religion and that this only applies to religions stemming from the judeo/Christian tradition.  \n\nI graduated high school in 1992.  The real world has taught me that you work with people who have different ways of thinking, are of a variety of ages, are of variety of races, and come from a variety of socio-economic, and religious backgrounds.

Find the probability of choosing blue, then yellow.\npossible choices...2/24. 2/3, 1/9, 2/27.\n\nNow suppose you choose one but don't replace the first pick. Find the probability of choosing blue then red. \npossible answers...6/17, 1/9, 8/81, 1/12\n\nNow find the probability of choosing yellow then blue. \npossible answers...1/7, 1/12, 2/27, 5/17. [SEP] best_answer: A) This one is slightly tricky.  The probability of gettng a blue ball is 3/7.  The probability of getting a ball with "4" on it is 2/7.  I want a blue ball or one with a "4", so it seems like 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/7 is correct.  However, this counts the blue #4 ball twice.  So I need 3/7 (probability of blue) + 2/7 (probability of "4") - 1/7 (probability of a blue "4") = 4/7.\n\nB) Probability of blue on the first draw is 2/9.  Probability of yellow on second draw is 3/9.  You want blue AND yellow, so 2/9 x 3/9 = 2/27.\n\nC) You are not replacing.  So probability of getting blue on first draw is 2/9, but red on second draw is 4/8 (there are only eight pencils left--one has been removed).  You want blue AND red, so 2/9 x 4/8 = 1/9.\n\nD) You didn't say whether to use replacement or not.  Yellow on first draw is 3/9, and blue on second draw (without replacement) is 2/8, so 3/9 x 2/8 = 1/12.  However, if you are going to use replacement, yellow on first draw is 3/9 and blue on second draw is 2/9, so 3/9 x 2/9 = 2/27 (which is also a possibility).  Since this comes right after the problem stating that you do not use replacement, I would go with 1/12 on this one.	Education & Reference

question_title: are there any grants for higher education for convicted felons? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You could be eligible for several types of Federal aid, depending on your situation.\n\nIf you currently incarcerated, you might be eligible for a Federal SEOG (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant) and, in some cases, a Pell Grant. (Your eligibility for Pell depends on the type of institution in which you are incarcerated. People in federal and state penal institutions aren’t eligible for Pell grants, but students in local penal institutions are eligible.) \n\nIf you're not incarcerated, your eligibility for both loans and grants depends on the nature of your offense. The law imposes restrictions on drug offenses: If you were convicted of possession or sale of illegal drugs at the same time that you were receiving federal student aid, you won't be eligible for federal aid until AT LEAST one year since your conviction, as follows:\n\nIf you were convicted for possession, and it was your first offense, you are eligible to federal aid one year from the date of your conviction. If you were convicted for selling (and it was your first offense), you must wait 2 years from your conviction date.... If you have more than one offense for selling or more than 2 offenses for possession, you can only regain eligibililty for federal student aid funds after you complete a certain type of rehab program. If you're not incarcerated and the above doesn't apply to you, you should be OK to receive aid.\n\nFederal aid aside, it is possible that there are scholarships out there for people looking to start anew -- perhaps some specific your circumstances. Try searching www.fastweb.com for organizations that help people looking to give people a second chance. I'm sure there are some out there.	Education & Reference

The last two years have you getting practical clinical experience, cycling among different specialties such as surgery, ob/gyn, pediatrics, psychiatry, emergency medicine, etc. \n\nAfter medical school, pretty much all doctors go through some combination of internship/residency for about five years, depending on the program. During this time, you are working very hard, sometimes for 24 or 36-hour shifts while you are on call, and you are paid about US$30,000 year. \n\nAfter that, you're a regular old doctor, whose specialty might be General Practice, or you might choose another specialty.

question_title: why cant johnny read? [SEP] question_content: why cant johnny find a job? [SEP] best_answer: Blanca V, I must ask the question of 'how old is Johnny,' before formulating any opinions about why johnny can not read or why johnny can not find a job.\nIf johnny is in or has attended school at least up to the eighth grade and still cannot read, he should already have been noticed as a possible dyslexic (not sure about the meaning of the word; however, I believe that dyslexia is an inabliity to receive visible letters as a person who is not dyslexic can).\nAnd if johnny has completed the 8th grade and still cannot find a job, and if he is dyslexic, then johnny cannot read a job ad, and maybe he would do better just simply asking for a job.\nI hope that this helps some.

question_title: what is cost production? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the belief that the value of an object is decided by the resources that went into making it. The cost can be composed of any of the factors of production including labour, capital, land, or technology.\n\nTwo of the most common cost-of-production theories are the medieval just price theory and the classical labor theory of value. The labor theory of value, which interprets labor-value as the determinant of prices, was first developed by Adam Smith and later expanded by David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Most classical economists (as well as nearly all Marxists) subscribe to it. However, Marx's theory is not a true cost-of-production theory since the value of a commodity contains a component of surplus value unrelated to the physical cost of producing it. The magnitude of this surplus value may be unrelated to production-costs. A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the "neo-Ricardian school" of Piero Sraffa and his followers.\n\nThe most common counterpoint to this is the marginal theory of value which asserts that economic value is set by the consumer's marginal utility. This is the view most commonly held by the majority of contemporary mainstream economists.	Education & Reference

question_title: Describe the chief features of the Shore Temples at Mahabalipuram? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mahabalipuram is a temple town situated along the shores of the Bay of Bengal in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The sheer sculptural extravaganza of the rock-cut temples is not only reflective of the artistic tastes of the erstwhile Pallava rulers: the temples are also regarded as the birthplace of an entirely new style of architecture, which came to be known as the South Indian temple architecture. \nMahabalipuram art can be divided into four categories : open air bas - relief, structured temples, man-made caves and rathas ('chariots' carved from single boulders, to resemble temples or chariots used in temple processions). The famous Arjuna's Penance and the Krishna Mandapa, adorn massive rocks near the centre of the village. The beautiful Shore Temple towers over the waves, behind a protective breakwater. Sixteen man-made caves in different stages of completion are also seen, scattered through the area.\n\nMahabalipuram is about 60 Kms. south of the city of Madras, in Tamil Nadu. Mahabalipuram, or Mamallapuram, was the chief seaport of the Pallavas who ruled over much of South India from as early as the first century B.C to the eighth century A.D., and it is now recognized as the site of some of the greatest architectural and sculptural achievements in India. \n\nTemples of Mahabalipuram\n\nCave Temples were excavated by scooping out the scarp of the hill. The scooping work starts from front to back. The cave temple is usually divided into inner & outer mandapas, distinguished by the difference in levels. The front mandapa will have pillars & plasters numbering 4,6,8,10. The inner mandapa contains single, triple or five cells. The cave temple with little modification is categorized as Mamalla style. The pillars under this style are slender & taller with squatting lion at their base. The pillar is divided into distinct parts known as kalasa, tadi, kumba, padma etc. \n\nMonolithic Temples are locally known as Rathas. They were executed by chiseling out the exterior face of the boulder. Work started from top to bottom. The pyramidal vimana with sikhara at the top is an important feature of this style. It can be rightly said that these monolithic temples must have paved the way for the structural temples with elaborate architectural & sculptural details in the subsequent stage. There a total number of 8 monolithic temples found in Mamallapuram. The five rathas in one place, Ganesha Ratha, Valayankuttai Ratha & Pidari Rathas.\n\nFive Rathas\nA small hill sloping from south to north has been segmented into five divisions & converted into monolithic temples. The heights of the segments have been cleverly used for temples with single tier to three-tiered vimana. Each monolithic temples shows different kind of sikhara. The five rathas are Dharmaraja Ratha, Bhima Ratha, Arjuna Ratha, Draupadi Ratha and Nakul Sahadev Ratha. \n\nShore Temple\n\nThe Shore Temple on the Bay of Bengal was constructed in the 7th century during the rule of King Narsimha-Varman II Rajasimha (c. 690-728).The Shore temples is a temple complex consisting of two Siva temples and a carving of Anantasayana Vishnu. \nThe temple facing east is entered by a small gopura. On plan, it consists of a small sanctum & a front mandapa & is a two-tired vimana. The sanctum is housing a linga. The Somaskanda panel consisting of Siva & Parvati with baby Skanda is on the back wall of the sanctum. The dhara linga & Somaskanda panel on the back wall of the sanctum are the features of the Pallava temples only. \nThe temple facing west is also dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is large in plan comprising sanctum, mahamandapa, front mandapa, balipitha and dvajastamba. The temple’s vimana is four tiered with octagonal sikhara. It is important to note that stupis of both these temples are not covered by kalasa (copper finials).\nThe carving on Lord Vishnu on a boulder in Anantasayana form is lying in between these two temples. It belongs \nto the period of Narasimhava	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: I'm still trying to figure out which of 2 universities I want to attend. I've accepted both until I figure it out. Are there any bad consequences for me when I inform one of them? [SEP] best_answer: Um, depends on what paperwork you've signed so far. For some universities, an acceptance (that is, mailing back in the form that says "yes, I'm coming") constitutes a binding contract and you'll be required to pay a deposit to the school or they can take legal action. For others, this is not true. So read over the form you signed carefully to make sure you're not committing to anything financially before you try this strategy. \n\nA better way might be just calling the department of admissions at both universities. Often if you talk to someone face to face, they can give you an extension on the deadlines for acceptances if you've got a good reason to need it.	Education & Reference

question_title: Can ear candling damage the inner ear? [SEP] question_content: I have been wanting to try ear candling for quite some time as I believe it will improve my hearing, but I can't really find any information about possible damage it could cause from something such as over-drying sensitive membranes or anything of that sort. Any advice is appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: Candling poses several dangers, the most serious of which involve burning caused by the hot wax. Candle manufacturers claim that their candles will drip only down the outside of the ear, but shamefully few direct the user to hold the candle horizontally to prevent this. A 1996 survey of 144 ear, nose, and throat physicians, found that 14 had seen patients who had been harmed by ear candling, including at least 13 cases of external burns, 7 cases of ear canal obstruction with candle wax, and 1 perforated eardrum [3].\n\nAnother case was reported by The London Free Press, a Canadian newspaper. A woman who experienced stuffiness in the nose and ear pains while scuba diving went to a local health-food store and was referred to a "qualified" candler. During the "treatment," she felt an intense burning in her ear. At the emergency room, attempts to remove wax that had dripped from the candle onto her eardrum failed. Surgery was required, and a hole in her eardrum was discovered, which presumably was caused by the procedure. She recovered fully, and luckily her hearing was not affected. The practitioner apologized, compensated the woman, and stopped performing ear coning [4].\n\nAlaska Fire Marshall Gary L. Powell has reported two instances of significant fires associated with ear candling., one of which led to the user's death. On January 27, 2005 a 59-year-old woman ignited her bedding when she dropped an ear candle that she was attempting to use the ear without any assistance. The candle ignited the bedding and quickly spread to curtains and other combustibles in the room. The woman did escaped but suffered an asthma attack and died in a hospital emergency room [5].	Health

question_title: how to gain weight with having fast metabolism? [SEP] question_content: if I eat more i vist the restroom more often or few times a day if i don't then i go every couple days. so what should i do? [SEP] best_answer: The key here is slow down your metabolism....and the way to do that is to eat less meals during the day but eat bigger meals when you do eat. This way your body has too much food to digest and your body stores the fat longer. Obviously the more unhealthy the meal the better for weight gain...however you don't mention the reason for you wanting to gain weight.\n\nIf it is a medical condition such as your thyroid then nothing will help to rectify your weight but medical help.\n\nAlso there are plenty of products on the market at the moment such as shakes to drink etc which help to build muscle....maybe try one of them, or even drinking beer adds on the pounds!!

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My wife had some acne issues when I met her 7 years ago.  She still has some to this day.  I see the other amazing things about her, and I don't feel that her acne marrs her beauty (how could something so small completely negate the entirety of her image?).  Find a man who could marry you for all the other wonderful things about you without being distracted by your acne.\n\nTo address the acne issue: wash your face with a nice face wash in the morning and at night.  You can try acne treatments, which will be available at your local drug store.  If none of that works, you can see a dermatologist who can prescribe other things for you.  My younger brother had a prescription that seemed to work miracles for him.	Health
question_title: what do i do for my daughter's diaper rash? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What is a DIAPER RASH?\n- "Diaper rash" refers a number of different skin conditions and rashes in the diaper area.\n\nCommon symptoms of a DIAPER RASH\n- Red, itchy, scaly rash patches in the diaper area and legs (atopic dermatitis).\n- Redness around the anus (perianal dermatitis).\n- Bright red and tender rash and/or spots in the folds between the thighs and abdomen with pustules spreading from the area (candidal dermatitis).\n- Redness and chafing where friction is greatest but not in the skin folds (chafing dermatitis).\n- Deep red rash with yellowish scales (saborrheic dermatitis).\n\nWhat are some causes of a DIAPER RASH?\n- Common causes of a diaper rash include excess moisture, chemical irritants, allergies to specific foods, bacteria from feces and urine, fungus, and friction from diapers and clothing.\n\nPrevention of a DIAPER RASH\n- Diapers should be changed and the area cleaned and allowed to dry as soon as possible after soiling or wetting.\n- The skin should be exposed to the open air for 5 to 10 minutes following each diaper change.\n- The use of plastic pants should be avoided or at least limited and diapers should not be too tight.\n- Changing of diaper brands may be considered with chronic diaper rash breakouts.\n- Irritants should be avoided or removed by washing with warm water and cotton balls and patting dry.\n\n    A physician should be contacted if:\n    -the rash becomes very red, raw, or sore looking.\n    -the rash has blisters, pustules, pus, peeling areas, or crusty patches.\n    -the rash is mainly in the skin creases possibly indicating a yeast infection.\n    -a significant rash lasts longer than a couple of days. \n\nTreatment of a DIAPER RASH\n- Diapers should be changed frequently.\n- The skin around the diaper area should be gently cleansed at every diaper change with warm water and patted dry.\n- The use of a skin protectant may be needed.

(Specific products may be recommended by a physician or pharmacist.)\n- A pediatrician may prescribe an antibiotic or anti-fungal cream for more severe cases.\n- The use of boric acid, corn starch or talc should be avoided.

question_title: How to be left-handed people? [SEP] question_content: My teacher said that left-handed people always smarter than right-handed people. Is it true? I don't know. But, I'm right-handed people and want to switch to left -handed people? Is it okay? And what's your suggest to make it easier... [SEP] best_answer: Your teacher was probably referring to ambidextrous people (im able to write, do anything actually with both hands, legs etc.) true ambidextrous people, not people that teach themselves how to do it think differently to just right handed or left handed people. Apparently i can switch my thinking to either side of my brain, over all i tend to have a "center" of thinking.  i can also read backwards and write backwards or with both hands at the same time without even thinking about it. I discovered this when i was a teenager, all my friends thought it was awesome and tried to do it! i thought it was so funny because they were all trying so hard when i didnt even have to think when i did it! \nI'm not sure if im smarter then other people, maybe i am lol! i did always get great marks in school so yer, but there are disadvantages-always have had trouble working out left from right, learning languages, trouble with figures/maths in general. All of those disadvantages are proven.\n\nYou cannot make yourself be left handed or ambidextrous and get the positives with it-like being intelligent (so they say).\nSo dont try to be, you cannot change how your brain works. \nHope this helped.

[SEP] best_answer: Some guys just naturally have a disappearing penis when they go limp. And when you are chilled it might try to curl up inside to keep warm. And for guys who are a bit overweight and have some fat covering their pubic bone, there is a tendency to have their limp penis hide in the layers of fat. If the latter is yoru problem, please consult a doctor and work toward losing weight and getting fit since being obese is a health hazard far worse than your worry about your penis disappearing.  If however,m you are fit and it still seems to go into hiding as it goes limp, well, that is just the way you are.	Health

question_title: Hepatitis B Question?

Thankx. [SEP] best_answer: Hepatitis B: A Brief History:\n\nIn 1965, Dr. Blumberg who was studying haemophilia, found an antibody in two patients which reacted against an antigen from an Australian Aborigine. Later the antigen was found in patients with serum type hepatitis and was initially designated "Australian Antigen". Subsequent study has shown the Australia Antigen to be the hepatitis B surface antigen. Dr. Blumberg was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Initially there appeared to be three particles associated with hepatitis B infection: a large "complete" particle called the "Dane particle", a small circular 20nm particle and an oblong 40nm particle. Further research identified the Dane particle as the hepatitis B viron and the other two particles as excess surface protein. This former terminology is no longer used and the virus is referred to according to its structure.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: More than likely you are spotting/ break through bleeding because you missed a pill or took one late. Did you make up the missed pill? You should always take all of the pills in your pill pack regardless of any bleeding. As soon as you realize that you missed a pill take it and stay on schedule with the rest of your pill pack. Not doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your pills. Also, these may not be the best pills for you, tell your doctor what symptoms you are having and they can determine a better pill for you. If you have stopped taking your pills or didn't make up the missed pills you would be wise to use condoms until you see your doctor and are told otherwise.	Health

I have used salt water and listerine every day now and it is not helping.  I don't have insurance and can't afford to go see a dentist if it is something normal. [SEP] best_answer: SWOLLEN GUMS IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE OR NORMAL.  let the nurse stick with nursing.  maybe salt water has miracle properties at the hospital but in your mouth it does nothing.  go to the dentist immediately.  if you wait you might end up in the ER with a serious infection and then the dentist after that anyway.  talk about expensive.  don't wait til it's something serious and you lose a tooth.

question_title: Weight loss with an injury? [SEP] question_content: I have a very bad ankle that needs surgery.  I also need to loose about 30lbs.  What kind of exercises can I do to loose weight AND not add more pain or injury to that ankle?  Walking and running are out of the picture entirely.\n\nserious replys only please [SEP] best_answer: SWIM SWIM SWIM. The best excercise in the world. Swimming is totally weightless and it works a series of ways. It is Aerobic and resistance training in one. Aerobic works to get your heart rate going and thus will increase metabolism and help circulation which all burn fat. Also if you are swimming and not doing a stationary type of water work out then your breathing becomes regulated by the type of stroke you are swimming. Resistance training is from the water friction. Every step and stroke you make is like having a few pounds on your hand. Resistance and light weight training is important when losing weight because you have to tighten the skin as well. Good luck, it will change your life when you lose the weight, but make sure you do it right.	Health

[SEP] question_content: How can I get my abs 100% strong? what should I eat and dont, work outs, and for how long or how many, advice and explain why?\n\nI drink alot of coke and eat alot of fast food. [SEP] best_answer: well you seem to know that drinking soda and eating fast food is not good for getting a six pack.  Running 3-5 times a week is the best way to burn stomach fat.  Doing situps and crunches just strengthens the muscles.  In order to start seeing a hard stomach you need to burn away the fat around it.  I suggest eating high protein low fat meals and if you still eat fast food try eating a salad instead of a burger or even a grilled chicken without mayo. It's all about choices and your dedication to your health. Good luck!	Health

question_title: can you find someone attractive without being attracted to them? [SEP] question_content: There was this man I worked with, he was in his 40's and I was/am in my 20's, who always flirted with me and acted interested.  The girls at work would tell me that he'd always gush about me, how cute and sweet I was.  However, we never dated and he never asked me on a date.  I was wondering, is it possible that he found me attractIVE but wasn't attractED to me?  I just thought it was kind of weird... [SEP] best_answer: I think that guy was just interested in flirting with you because you were younger.  He might have just wanted to see if he could get a response from you, or maybe he just wanted to get into your pants.\n\nIt is possible to think someone is attractive without being attracted to them.  I think some of my male friends are attractive, but I am not interested in anything other than friendship with them.  I also think that some of my female friends are attractive, but I am "straight" and not interested in them either.  \n\nI'd say it noticing how people look, and how they look to you.\nYou don't have to act on it.  But if you do, ie you go after everyone you think is attractive, then you have issues and people will not think very much of you.  That's my theory.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Public Marital Put-Down? [SEP] question_content: What does it mean when your spouse puts down married life in front of your friends while you're right there? \nAnd what do you do about it? [SEP] best_answer: That may be his sense of humor.  Something he thinks he is expected to do around "the guys".  There is a stigma around marriage that it should be miserable.  Your hubby may be one of those who wants to fit in so he subscribes to the stereotypes people hold of him and his life.  (I could be wrong)\n\nIn private I would tell him that what he said really bothered you.  Ask him if he really feels that way or if he was just trying to be funny.  Inform (gently not confrontationaly) that it wasn't funny and jokes as such really hurt you, especially around other people.  If he really feels that way it may be time for some marriage counseling.

question_title: How do you right a wrong? If the person does not know what you did? [SEP] question_content: If a person does not know that you did something wring but you feel guilty about it how do you make it better [SEP] best_answer: I believe honesty is the best policy, but don't be honest just to relieve your own pain. Being honest about a mistake often hurts the other person more than you think. Sometimes its best to just keep quiet and live with the guilt... and hopefully the knowledge that you made a mistake and will never repeat it. \njust_a_guy_in_florida@yahoo.com	Family & Relationships

question_title: Propose or Promise Ring? [SEP] question_content: I've been with my girl for 4 months.. we wanna get married after college.. we are going to diff colleges... so before i left i was thinking of a promise ring or proposal.. so we could be enagaged the whole time... Please tell what u think... because we are in total love head over heels for each other... and spend everyday together... colleges are only an hour apart.. and we both already promised to never cheat or anything to each other because we love each other too much... so Proposal.. or Promise Ring? [SEP] best_answer: Ok i'm not a guy so I can't give you a guy's point of view but, from my point of view, I think that's really sweet what you are trying to do. And she must be an amazing woman because it sounds like you really love her and don't want to lose her. Please don't take what I'm fixing to write to offense, but I think if yall are in college I wouldn't give her the promise ring. Reason being, yall aren't 15-16 years old anymore. Yall are in college, old enough to do what yall want live together old enough to get married. A promise ring to me is for teenagers. If yall already talked about what you want when you get of college and including getting married, go with the engagement ring. Trust me, well I'm not your girlfriend, but I'm sure she will feel and understand what I'm telling you. Now because I said don't get the promise ring for her get the engagement ring doesn't mean you have to do that. This yall's life you make the desicion I'm giving you my and many other womens point of view. I hope I was able to help.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Body Issue, is it normal? [SEP] question_content: Hey there....I am 16 years old and looking to delve into a relationship with a great girl I can't stop thinking about. I don't want this relationship to be ruined by taking things too fast, but I have an issue. My...erm...unit isn't straight when it's at a full salute. In fact, it leans about 20 degrees to the left. I noticed the scar from circumcision some time ago and can't help but wonder, is this normal? If it isn't...are there options to fix it when I turn 18? What options do I have? Thanks [SEP] best_answer: First off, Kudos to you for not being like every other a**hole guy and going straight into a girls pants!! Secondly,  Believe it or not, not very many guys have straight...uh... areas.  Though, it sounds like it could have been a result of too much skin being cut from your circumcision.  Im assuming its pretty normal considering you have probably had a physical with your doctor and the issue was never brought up before.  If your that uncomfortable about it, ask your doctor if there is anything you can do to change it.	Family & Relationships

My expectation on life is to continue to better myself as a person, spiritually, mentally/emotionally, & physically. My ability to achieve lies within.

question_title: How to beat temtation when my Boyfriend leaves? [SEP] question_content: My bf is leaving for ohio in 3 weeks for 3 months. He is telling my best friend to keep all the guys away and she is going to try. I really think I love him but there is the guy i have had a crush on is now starting to get jealous and flirt alot. He is always trying to kiss me. So how do i keep him away. [SEP] best_answer: if you really love your boyfriend that much, it shouldn't be an issue...do you want to ruin your relationship with him for this other guy who may not even want a relationship with you? He may just want something else, so you gotta really think if it's worth it. My boyfriend has been gone for 9 months and I'm still very much in love with him, and very faithful. I can't imagine losing him for some "crush"...I alwayz say if you want to cheat, you obviously don't want to be with the person you're with...cuz if you do, you wouldn't even think about cheating. Just tell that guy you have a boyfriend and you're not interested. if he keeps bothering you, don't hang around him anymore.	Family & Relationships
question_title: What was the craziest blind date you have ever had? [SEP] question_content: i've had one for the record books......i was just wondering if anyone else had strange experiences too. [SEP] best_answer: I have one for you.  I used to live in Columbus, Ohio, and I'd put an ad in a Single's Magazine.  There was one lady that replied that seemed relatively nice, so we agreed to meet at a restaurant one day.  When we met she was so nervous you could cut the tension with a knife.  I don't remember what we talked about or for how long we talked but after the date was over we never saw or heard from each other again.  She was relatively nice looking and had a pleasant personality, but no matter how hard I tried I could not get her to relax.  I  could honestly feel the tension so bad that I felt I was being pushed against a wall.  Definitely a very strange experience because I don't think I'd ever scared someone so bad in life as much as I think I scared this poor woman.  Oh well, I chaulked it up as one for experience.

[SEP] best_answer: you may need to knee him in the groin area as you're telling him you're not interested. technically, it's not assault. it would be considered harrassment if you had already told him you're not interested before, therefore you would be defending yourself :O)	Family & Relationships

Take in what they are talking about and the way they discuss things. This will give you plenty of clues as to what they want to talk about and how they expect people who are speaking to them to talk about those things. Once you are familiar with all of this, then learn something about any subjects they talk about that you don't know much about, so that you can carry on a decent conversation.	Family & Relationships

You gotta' stay away from those kinds of people, and even the people they sleep with... chances are, there's some type of disease floating around there.\n\nA whore can be either male or female...  Just because a guy sleeps around and his buddies thinks it's the greatest thing, doesn't make him any better than the female who does it.  They are both whores in my book, and need to find some respect for themselves.	Family & Relationships

I used system restore and was able to download an anti-spyware and it found 2 browser hijackers in the start up and cleans it but the virus reappears again and again and always restarts whenever I type or search words like spyware, browser hijacker, malware, removal, etc.\n\nPlease help. I’m in the middle of a job-project that my file might be damaged.\nMy PC is Intel Pentium 4, win XP sp2, 1.7 GHZ, 512MB ram.\n\nMany Thanks\nHenny [SEP] best_answer: Ur computer has been affected by multiple viruses....since u say that even after removal by the anti-spyware, the virus seems to reappear.before i tell u the reasons i'll tl u what u must do as there is no easy solution to this problem, since the contents of the original MBR(master boot record) is lost.  The only solution for the anti-virus program is to detect that there is a problem, and to over write the contents of the MBR with a valid MBR program, which the anti-virus program will have to carry with itself.  If your favorite anti-virus program is not that smart, consider replacing it with a better one, or just boot from a write-protected uninfected DOS 5.0 diskette, and execute the program FDISK with the option /MBR.  This will re-create the executable code in the MBR without modifying the partition table data.\n\nIn general, infection by multiple viruses of the same file or area is possible and vital areas of the original may be lost.  This can make it difficult or impossible for virus disinfection tools to be effective, and replacement of the lost file/area will be necessary.U must have proper back-up for the projects that are going on.If there are no back ups then i think u have to loose some stuff.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED\nThe first of these viruses that infects the computer will overwrite the Master Boot Record with its body and store the original MBR at a certain place on the disk.  So far, this is normal for a boot-record virus.  But if now the other virus infects the computer too, it will replace the MBR (which now contains the virus that has come first)with its own body, and store what it believes is the original MBR (but in fact is the body of the first virus) AT THE SAME PLACE on the harddisk, thus OVERWRITING the original MBR.  When this happens, the contents of the original MBR are lost.  Therefore the disk becomes non-bootable.\n\nWhen a virus removal program inspects such a hard disk, it will see the SECOND virus in the MBR and will try to remove it by overwriting it with the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR.  However, now this sector contains the body of the FIRST virus. therefore, the virus removal program will install the\nfirst virus in trying to remove the second.  In all probability it will not wipe out the sector where the (infected) MBR has been stored.\n\nWhen the program is run again, it will find the FIRST virus in the MBR.  By trying to remove it, the program will get the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR, and will move it over the current (infected) MBR.  Unfortunately, this sector still contains the body of the FIRST virus.  Therefore, the body of\nthis virus will be re-installed over the MBR ad infinitum.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is the differece between bpo and call centre jobs? [SEP] question_content: what is the difference between BPO and call centre jobs? [SEP] best_answer: BPO means Business Processes Outsourcing. It can involve outsourcing(getting work done by third party) of any activity of a business like accounting, customer service, payroll preparation, data mining and so on. \nA Call centre is a place where trained people take customer service calls/enquiries for a particular company. Now a call centre work can be done by the company itself (called captive call centre) or it can be outsourced from a specialised firm (then it is called BPO).\n\nSo, essentially Call Center is a type of BPO service.\nSecondly, in a call center job you have to answer customer calls, whereas in a BPO job you could be doing call center work or any other process also maybe just desk job like data processing.

question_title: when i try to install a second anti virus program, it cautions me to remove my other programs.  what gives? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is something I noticed with Norton but this is probably because they don't want the competition. Sometimes one antivirus will find things that the other can't but usually collisions don't occur. In theory they can't pickup the quarantine of the other as that defies the idea of quarantine: where a virus is isolated. I have 2 antiviruses working in the background and you find that one will pick it up before the other (For me this is OneCare from Microsoft). Why do you need two antiviruses anyway? One combined with a good firewall is safe enough protection.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how do i connect two computers in a home network? one is upstais and the other downstairs? [SEP] question_content: I have one computer downstairs and another one upstairs. The computer downstairs is connected to the internet via a DSL modem by USB. Both the computers have Ethernet and USB 2.0 ports. What I want to do is to connect the two computers in some way so that both computers will have internet access. The problem is that I don't want to connect them by the means of wireless. I perfer cable. What equipment should I buy? The distance between the two computers is about 50 feet. [SEP] best_answer: You need  a router. if you don't want a wireless router, then you can get a wired router and buy enough cat5 cable to run from the upstairs computer to the router downstairs. You will then connect your DSL modem to the router and both computers to the router. Go to your computer name settings from the properties of my computer and enter a workgroup name for both of them (the default is "workgroup" and will work fine also), not the domain setting. The router software should set up a dynamic host table to give both of the computers their own IP addy to communicate on so you can use automatically detect in the TCP/IP settings. the DSL modem will now recognize the DSL modem as the IP address for your home account, not that of the computer. If you want sharing permissions for files and folders then you will need to create profiles on each of the computers that give the necessary permissions for the other computers profile/sign on. \n\nThe cat5 cable itself will have to be physically run from the upstairs computer to the router so you will need to either get enough to tack it on the stairs and wall trim etc or drill through the floor/ceiling.\n\n\nGood Luck	Computers & Internet

question_title: Why is Ads by google everywhere? I hate it? [SEP] question_content: I'm beginning to hate google. Why is it that all sites are annoyingly congested with google adverts that instead of finding rich content you see google adverts everywhere? Is google paying the site owners for displaying adverts on their sites? How does the whole thing works? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, on most sites, ads are the major source of income.  They are slots sold by the webhost (google in our case) to another company (our example AD)\n\nYou're surfing on Google, hypothetically, and you come accross an annoying AD.  you might click on it on accident, you may ignore it, or you may be intrigued and click on it for more information.  Google is happy any way, because they get money for allowing others to put their information on the Google site.  The company is happy if the first or last happen.  If the first happens they get another "Hit" which shows how many times the site has been visited, increasing rankings/popularity/etc. the third, they get an additional Hit, but they also run the chance of selling something/getting another Hit on a linked site.\n\nSo you see, Ads are needed for a site to run, on both ends.

question_title: what are all the languages necessary for web designing? [SEP] question_content: hi i am an engineering student. i would like to know the computer languages needed for web designing in every aspects. [SEP] best_answer: Web pages are mostly written in HTML.  If you want pages to accept data or do cool things like show picture slide shows you can use javascript.  Now if you want to create truely dynamic web pages that people can log in at, extract data, or search for things you'll want to use PHP.  To search you'll need a database to store info in which case you can use SQL, one such implementation is MySQL.  \n\nThese are all FREE!  There are pleanty of resources on the net to teach you.  So just search on their names and you will get plenty to keep you busy.\n\nThere are more, but this is a very popular group of software commonly known as LAMP.  Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. \n\nWhen you get all that working you can create super fancy stuff using FLASH from Adobe-Macromedia.  That one will cost ya.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How is yahoo answers, differant then a chat room? [SEP] question_content: I only been in a chat room a few time, so I don't really remember, but isen't yahoo answers close to a chat room ? [SEP] best_answer: It is not intended to be a chat room at all, nor does it follow a similar format.\n\nA chat room offers a way for people to interact real time.  Mostly about nonsense, sometimes about something in particular.  Again, people are communicating real time, back and forth.\n\nYahoo! Answers offers people a way to ask a question, and solicit feedback from other participants.  It is not real time, and there is little immediate interaction.  It is not intended to be used as a method of direct communication---It is meant to pose questions and share answers.\n\nAs mentioned in Yahoo's own description, the topics can be from the silly to the serious, just like a chat room, but it's not a way to communicate like a chat room.

question_title: how do i clean squirrels so i can eat them? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pretty easy, really.\nAfter you kill the squirrel, take your knife and cut a hole in the center of his back, crosswise of his body.  Make the hole about a inch wide.  Next, insert on finger from either hand into the opening, and pull just enough to make the hole large enough to get a better grip with more fingers.  Then just pull your hands apart.  The skin will usually tear around the squirrel, leaving it looking very much like a pair of pants and a shirt on the squirrel.  Pull off the top part first, the "shirt" pulling the skin up until his wrist and neck is free of skin.  Then break the wrist and cut loose below the freed skin.  Remove the head, and the skin from the "shirt" has the head and front feet in it.  Unless you plan on eating the brains, throw it away.  Personally, I'll leave squirrel brains and scrambled eggs to the old-timers!\nNext, hit the bottom half, the "pants"  Same basic procedure, but this time you're gonna have some intestines at the bottom, and if it was a male squirrel there's gonna be some more equipment down there...just yank it or cut it off.\nNow when you open it up, use just the tip of your knife. Put your finger on the backside of the blade, about a half inch or so from the point, so you don't bust any internal organs.  Horrible smell...avoid if possible.  Start at the pelvis and run the blade all the way up to the ribcage.  At this point, rupturing organs are no longer a concern, so go ahead and slice the ribcage open, sternum to throat.  Slide your fingers into the abdomen cavity, and pull out the internals.  Make sure you get all of it; it's not hard.  Next, remove the lungs and heart.  Make sure to get the windpipe.  Also, remember to bust the pelvis and make sure you get all the intestines and any droppings that may have squeezed out.  \nTake the squirrel inside, wash it with cold water, remove the legs and cut in half about halfway up the body.  Fill a fairly large bowl with saltwater, and put the dressed squirrel in it and put the whole thing in the refridgerator for at least a few hours, or overnight.  Then, pull the squirrel out, wash it, and either cook it, or freeze it.  \nI, personally, prefer mine fried, although squirrel dumplings are great, too...	Sports

question_title: Bernard Hopkins or Tarver?...who u think will win??? [SEP] question_content: i'm praying Hopkins can bow out with this win as one of greatest boxers in his weight class.... [SEP] best_answer: B-Hop is moving up to fight tarver, so either way i dont think many would say he wasnt one of the great fighters at 160. Probably one of the best things b hop has going for him is that tarver is coming down in weight from that foolish rocky movie (and a lot of guys cant really recover from cutting all the weight for one reason or another). Tarver is a pretty skilled boxer so hopkins edge against most fighters probably doesnt come into play as much here. I dont know how much he has left in the tank at this point, but i do hope he can beat tarver for one last hurrah. Still i think tarver wins by a close decision, since thats the way it seems their styles will dictate this fight. Either way hopkins is an all time great at 160.	Sports

question_title: When shooting a fire arm how come the rekasha never hit the shooter? [SEP] question_content: i was wonder because on this tv show the were shoooting and it bbounced back and hit the car not the shooter how so [SEP] best_answer: The bullet would have to strike something that would cause the bullet to bounce straight back in order for the shooter to be hit. Normally the bullet will strike something at an angle. When the bullet hits, the object it hits absorbs energy from the bullet. The greater the angle, the less energy is absorbed. Example, if you are shooting across water, the bullet might strike at a 175 degree angle, little energy is absorbed by the water and the bullet will travel very far after hitting the water. If the bullet strikes pavement at 45 degrees, half of the energy will be absorbed by the pavement, and will not travel much farther after hitting the pavement. If the bullet hits a concrete wall at 90 degrees, all of the energy is absorbed by the wall, the bullet has no energy left to ricochet back to the shooter. If the wall were made of rubber, the wall would absorb all of the energy, but because of the elastic properties of rubber, the rubber would transfer some of the energy back to the bullet, and throw the bullet back to the shooter. Hope this helps.	Sports

question_title: Best national anthem? [SEP] question_content: Which national anthem is the most rousing before a football match? For me, France's is spine-tingling..

The Anthem was composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra and the music was arranged by Jaime Nunó.\nFrance is a classic, also (like Mexico's) a military march, full of feeling and history.. \nUSA's is pretty but not that strong, i feel it more like romatic, but obviously is not a march. I do not know its history, but the lyrcs are very sentimental. That is way it sounds so pretty when it is singed "a capella". \nJust like Germany's hymn from Haydn. the issue with the verses i think its somehow stupid, that had nothing to do with the WWII, I like the lyrics but the music is very pretty and i think its motto Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit represents totally what Germany is today.\n \nAnd the very best is the Hymn of Europa: The tune of the Ode to Joy  (Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and the lyrics are from Friedrich Schiller)	Sports

Lean forward as if you were hurdling grab hold of a fence, wall, or another hurdle. Place you lead leg beside hurdle and snap your trail leg over the hurdle.\n* First, the hurdles must be brought in closer. Shorten the distance between the first and second hurdle so that you can 3 step without bounding.\n* Use your feet to walk off the distance you moved the hurdle from the original marks, now walk off the same distance for all of the other hurdles.\n* Run these in practic till in feel like you are getting too close to the next hurdle then move all the hurdles a step forward.\n* The transition takes time, do not force the 3 step, so "just run" go over the hurdle with what ever leg comes up. Eventually 3 stepping will occur by itself. \n\n\n 300-400M Hurdles running drills\n\nFirst 6:  - The first six hurdles are setup on the marks. The first six hurdle are then ran at race pace to build rhythm.\nRun 5 to 7 of these to build rhythm and strength.\n\n Last 3:  \n- The last three hurdles are setup on the marks, used for 300 hurdle training to build strength.\nRun 3 to 5 of these to build strength.

question_title: What are the core beliefs of the political left and the political right? [SEP] question_content: What are they trying to achieve in the end? [SEP] best_answer: at the root of the political institutions of the left and right, there are simple human emotions.  Because of this, what those institutions eventually achieve or fail to achieve is ultimately beyond the reach of such institutions to predict, no matter how much the followers of a particular philosophy want it to be otherwise.  \n\nto sum up the emotions I'm referring to: If the status quo benefits someone, they tend to be conservative and on the right.  If the status quo doesn't particularly do any good for a person, they tend to be liberal and on the left.  \n\nthis is why students and young people tend to the left - they have no property or high social status to defend, no great steady job to hang onto.  But these same people, a few years later, often wouldn't be going to protests anymore, because they have a good job and a mortgage and car payments and whatnot.  Generally, as people age they become more conservative.   \n\nthe more status and property people have, the higher their priority is to protect what they've got.  So, the old dad who used to be a hippy, is a grumpy stick-in-the-mud by the time his kids are idealistic teens!\n\nthis dynamic all works on a large, collective scale as well.  It's all about what people have to lose.  The more they have to lose, the further right they drift...	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: i think, those people who say nasty things should first delve into details and be open minded enough..

To make themselves feel better they judge what other people say and do without ever really finding out about it.  Despite everything we know about the history of the world and all the technology at our fingertips too many people ignore all the information we have.

question_title: what were the issues in the 1976 presidential election between carter and ford? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would challenge the "not hotly contested" - Carter started off with a lead, but it did get closer towards the end of the race. He only won by about 3 percentage points and it was also fairly close electorally.\n\nAs to the issues themselves, Watergate kind of overshadowed every election in both 1974 and 1976. Carter presented himself as an outsider, someone untainted by Washington politics who would clean up the system.\nFord basically played the experience card, arguing that Carter lacked the experience to lead the country.\nThe other major issues were economics, especially inflation and Ford's inability to control it (look up WIN buttons).\nAnd Ford did make a major faux pas about the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe during one of the debares.

question_title: Do other countries have the right to use rendition to interrogate US civilians or military personnel? [SEP] question_content: Since the US president has first denied, then admitted and then justified the use of extraordinary rendition to snatch individuals out of foreign countries and send them where they can be tortured for information, should other countries be allowed to do the same thing to US citizens and gov't employees? Many other countries consider our actions to be terrorist in nature (not saying I agree, but I am aware of their assertions). [SEP] best_answer: You know, I am never shocked at what one human will do to another, even without just cause.  Torture is in my book an effective means of gaining information, but completely inhumane. Any national of any country technically is forbidden to engage in torture during wartime; as far as I understand the Geneva Convetions. But who is actually going to refrain when they believe their cause for doing so is justified? As for the question of should anyone have the right to engage in torture, I'd have to say level the playing field and let a war be a war again, stop trying to civilize the most uncivilized act possible!

question_title: Even when a report PROVES the existence of WMD's in Iraq the LIBS still don't get it. Why? [SEP] question_content: The report released today proves that the former government of Iraq lied to weapons inspectors and to the UN Security Council and has stockpiles of WMD's stashed randomly around the country and yet even after all of this is proven the libs here and on TV are STILL coming up with excuses. Why can't they just admit they were wrong, or better yet just admit that they're anti-war hippies?\n\nAnd, more importantly, why do the libs always pretend that WMD's were the only reason given for a war in the middle east? [SEP] best_answer: That's easy.  Back when we were all discussing why Saddam needed his ass kicked, the libs kneejerked their way into a corner.  They hate(d) Bush SOOOO bad, they couldn't allow themselves to be seen agreeing with him, so the importance of the WMDs had to be minimized.  Now, any time a report comes out that demonstrates Iraq had WMD's, the lib press and politicians will talk about anything BUT that report.\n\nThe libs aren't completely stupid (ok, they are, but that's another topic) and they realize that to admit they were wrong will not only remove their mainstream base, but they will also loose face with the extreme lefties.  Not a good thing with elections coming up, so all they have left to do is scream about bringing the troops home, blah blah blah to divert attention from the real issues.	Politics & Government
question_title: If the king or queen commits a crime, how will he/she be tried in court? What will be the case's title? [SEP] question_content: Has a king or queen committed a crime and tried before a court in history? I know many monarchs have gotten away with their heinous crimes, while the unlucky ones had their citizens revolt against them, but have any actually been taken to court before? What will be the case's title? After all, the state is prosecuting the monarch him/herself. Rex v. Rex? Regina v. Regina? What about if the king or queen takes their respective spouse to court? Rex v. Regina? Regina v. Rex? [SEP] best_answer: In the United Kingdom the sovereign not only has immunity from prosecution, it has become accepted that he or she cannot be required to give evidence in court. \n\nIt is true that Charles I was tried for treason before a Parliamentary court, convicted and executed. However, it should be noted that after the Restoration in 1660 the men who had tried the king were arrested. Several of them were then hung, drawn and quartered and, with a few exceptions, the rest were imprisoned for life.	Politics & Government

We were "to;d" (No signed contract) that it was first and last with any stipulations 110 yrs ago that it would go up with rent increases. Can they demand more than original "last months'" rent? [SEP] best_answer: If not in writing it's going to be tough to fight it. Unless it was specifically addressed in your verbal agreement they have every legal right to ask for additional deposit. Obviously if you've been there for 10 years you must like the place a lot; probably not worth fighting.	Politics & Government

And joining the Military(not sure which branch yet) is one of my options. Its not the money or college opportunites that I like about the Military,( I have enough money to go to about any college) mostly its prestige. So anyways my question is basically what were your experinces during training, how tough is it really and any info you can give me on it.  Also which branch would you recommend, and will a GED cut it? [SEP] best_answer: The training in ANY branch is absolutely "no harder than it needs to be".  You'll notice that I put that in quotes.  The saying is old, but it's true.  The idea behind the training is to keep you alive in a combat situation.  Is it hard?  Yes.  Is it too hard?  Depends on how much you value your life, honestly.  The USAF training is not too hard, because they are not on the ground.  USN focuses on swimming and staying alive in water (go figure).  The Army and Marines training is harder (USMC is harder and longer), because they are on the ground and doing the dirty.\n\nWhich branch would I recommend?  The branch that offers YOU the best deal for YOU!  I spent 20 years in the Army, and was a recruiter.  I know that the Army has the best deal out there, but it's YOUR life, YOUR decision.  You need to sit down with each branch, get your information, and make your decision after reviewing ALL the material.\n\nGED?  That's a timing issue.  If you have some college, that will help.  If you can score over 50 on the ASVAB, that will help.  That's another issue that needs to be brought up with the recruiting offices. \n\nGood luck	Politics & Government

Keep them locked up for years.\n\n(2)  China also harvests the organs of political prisoners (there are reports they are simply killed for the organs).\n\n(3)  Think of the extreme governments around the world that hold their women to sub-servient roles, denying them education or career advancement.\n\n(4)  Despotic tribal governments which are conducting acts of genocide on refugee camps, or their own people fleeing the destruction of their own villages.\n\nYou read about this, and you often think, "Didn't this happen in the Dark Ages?"   Sadly, it's a reality that affects over half the planet.   Yes, over half.\n\nSo, while our government can always use improvement, I am grateful to live here.

question_title: probation violation? [SEP] question_content: I have been convicted of 2 DUI's, I was sentenced to 90 days house arrest and 2 years probation. After my house arrest was done. I was seen in a local bar by a probation officer. I met with my probation officer, she made me see the light. I felt it was over. Now I get a letter, 6 weeks later, that I have to go to a hearing for probation revocation. What should I expect to happen? I have no other charges, have not been in trouble. And when I am tested for alcohol I am clean [SEP] best_answer: It is likely that you have a probation term that requires you to not be in a place where alcohol is the primary item sold (such as a bar or liquor store).  Where I work, that is a VERY common term amongst probationers whose probation is due to alcohol charges.  If your probation officer is on your side, now is probably a good time to get in their and sell your case to him or her.  You will need them on your side when you go to court.\n\nIt is likely that a term of your probation included a suspended jail or prison term (jail time that you will have to serve if you mess up on probation) - almost all probation does.  If so, you may be looking at jail or prison time.	Politics & Government

I have asked for this to be re-calculated and be more in line with the standard rate.  How does the IRS come up with their figure?  Is it only cost of gas on a national average? Does it include wear and tear on the vehicle, tires etc.. [SEP] best_answer: IR-2005-99, Sept. 9, 2005\n\nWASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department announced an increase to the optional standard mileage rates for the final four months of 2005.\n\nThe rate will increase to 48.5 cents a mile for all business miles driven between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 2005. This is an increase of 8 cents from the 40.5 cent rate in effect for the first eight months of 2005, as set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-64.\n\n<edit>\n\nWhile gasoline is a major factor in the mileage figure, other items enter into the calculation of mileage rates, such as the price of new vehicles and insurance.\n\nThe optional business standard mileage rate is used to compute the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business use in lieu of the extra burden of tracking actual costs. This rate is also used as a benchmark by the federal government and many businesses to reimburse their employees for mileage.	Politics & Government

question_title: what is sun? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Our SUN is a normal main-sequence G2 star, one of more than 100 billion stars in our galaxy. \n\n        diameter:    1,390,000 km.\n        mass:        1.989e30 kg\n        temperature: 5800 K (surface)\n                     15,600,000 K (core)\n\nThe SUN is by far the largest object in the solar system. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest). \n\nIt is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. That's true in the sense that there are many others similar to it. But there are many more smaller stars than larger ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. The median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less than half the mass of the Sun. \n\nThe Sun is personified in many mythologies: the Greeks called it Helios and the Romans called it Sol. \n\nThe Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else ("metals") amounts to less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core. \n\nThe outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles it's as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun is not a solid body like the Earth. Similar effects are seen in the gas planets. The differential rotation extends considerably down into the interior of the Sun but the core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.\n\nThere are nine planets and a large number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun. (Exactly which bodies should be classified as planets and which as "smaller objects" has been the source of some controversy, but in the end it is really only a matter of definition.) \n\n          Distance  Radius  Mass\nPlanet    (000 km)   (km)   (kg)   Discoverer   Date\n-------- --------  ------  -------  ----------  -----\nMercury     57,910    2439  3.30e23\nVenus      108,200    6052  4.87e24\nEarth      149,600    6378  5.98e24\nMars       227,940    3397  6.42e23\nJupiter    778,330   71492  1.90e27\nSaturn   1,426,940   60268  5.69e26\nUranus   2,870,990   25559  8.69e25   Herschel    1781\nNeptune  4,497,070   24764  1.02e26   Galle       1846\nPluto    5,913,520    1160  1.31e22   Tombaugh    1930	Science & Mathematics

question_title: If time is the measurement of change...? [SEP] question_content: Can someone tell me what exactly is changing? I mean, is the change thats being measured simply entropy? And if thats the case couldnt you say that time is the measurement of entropy or does that leave out some other change that Im not aware of? [SEP] best_answer: With advances in relativity, quantum mechanics and microscopy, time is actually currently defined as measuring the number of vibrations of a cesium atom.\n\nSince this motion slows down as you approach the speed of light, it could be said that we are measuring how much matter/energy has slowed down from the speed of light since the big bang...\n\nSince entropy is defined as, "the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work," measuring how long it has been since the big bang is not QUITE the same as measuring the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work.\n\nFor example, entropy itself has changes as our technology has progressed - we are now able to utilize a larger percentage of wind and solar energy than ever before in history, which necessarily means that the rate that entropy is increasing has slowed.  There is no reason to believe this will not be the case in other areas, such as nuclear fusion (which powers stars) or even tapping the vast vaccuum energy that is omniprescent throughout space.\n\n:)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is current? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Current is defined as the movement of charge  -- which can either be from the movement of electrons, or the movement of ions in solution.  For metals (and circuits), current is produced when electrons move through the metal.  In water, you can have ions (like Na+ and Cl-) which move in the solution.  The key point is that charge has to MOVE for you to have current.  \n\nFrom a Physics point of view, if the amount of charge is 'Q', then current is defined as 'i = dQ/dt'  where 'i' is current, and dQ/dT denotes the "change in current as a funtion of a change in time."

question_title: how do you know when hurricanes are going to come and go away? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hurricane season is officially June 1 to Nov 30.  If you are in an area that gets them, watch the tropical updates on http://www.weather.com and you'll know soon enough. The ONLY good things about them is that you get some warning.  You don't usually with a tornado or earthquake.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Is carbon dating appropriate for measuring the age of materials that are a few years old? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No. Radiocarbon dating relys on Carbon 14 which has a half-life of 5730±40 years. Most answers for carbon dating give a range of 100-200 years over when a sample might be from.\n\nIn addition to the half-life, you also need to know something about where the carbon in the sample came from, because different sources have different starting amounts of C14. \n\nThis means that carbon dating something modern would tell you it was made in the last 100 years. You could probably get a better estimate of the age, just by looking at it.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: A curve in a highway has a radius of 120m and is banked at 2.50 degrees.? [SEP] question_content: On an icy road, what is the safest speed to around the curve [SEP] best_answer: To stay on the road with no slip the vector of total force on a car F must be strictly normal to the bank with b=2.5 degrees. Vector F=Fx+Fy, Fy=m*g being the weight of the car, Fx=m*a=m*r*w^2 is centripetal force on the curve of r=120m, w=v/r is angular speed, v is linear speed, a=r*w^2 is centripetal acceleration. On the other hand as Fx=F*sin(b) & Fy=F*cos(b) or Fx/Fy=tg(b) or [m*r*(v/r)^2]/[m*g]=tg(b), hence v=sqrt(g*tg(b)*r)=7.17m/s=25.81 km/h. Hi to SS!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If a time machine was ever built, is it possible to go into what has not happened yet? (the future) not happen [SEP] question_content: Is it possible to go into what has never happened yet with a time machine? [SEP] best_answer: The concept of a time machine could exist, but it would take an almost infinite amount of energy.  The only way it could work is exactly the way you are asking,  You can only move forward in time, just at different rates.  So if you want to see the future then time would need to slow down for you and the world would have to speed up.  After a while you could return to earth and it would be the future.  \nFrom what is presently known about physics you can only move forward in time only at different rates from an observers point of view.  Believe me if we could travel back in time someone would have already screwed it up something big by now.\n\nThis is a one way trip, good luck	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How would your kidneys maintain the water and mineral balance of your blood on...? [SEP] question_content: a) a cool day when you stayed inside and drank lots of tea?\nor\nb) a hot sports day when you ran three races and had forgotten your water bottle?\n\nplease help! [SEP] best_answer: The kidneys are always trying to maintain homeostasis - keeping the water to mineral ratio in your blood constant.\n\nIf you stayed inside and drank lots of tea, you will have a big increase in water in your blood, while the amount of minerals stays the same. Your kidneys would then remove lots of water from your blood and keep the minerals, to return the concentration of minerals back to normal. (You'll urinate a lot)\n\nIf you used up a lot of your body's water by sweating and then not replenishing it, the mineral concentration would be much higher. The kidneys will try to return the concentration back to normal by letting out a lot of minerals but not a lot of water (You won't urinate as much, and when you do, it will be very concentrated)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can anyone explain the different types of time paradoxes? [SEP] question_content: Are there more than just simple causality? [SEP] best_answer: 1) You can't change a past event, that's nescessary for you to be able to change that past event. (You can't kill your distant ancestor)\n2) You can't go experience a future event, that requires someone from that future event to change your present event. (In the 'Planet of the Apes' movie series, Caesar went back to his past, and started an ape rebelion that built the world that Charleton Heston visited when he went into his future)\n\nBut how would you know? Changing the past or the future might create a tangent universe, that we can't experience.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how are small scale industries organised and grouped? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: your question is strange, to say the least, and therefore hard to answer.  grouped?  probably not but then you must first make a list of products made & group them according to the type of industry they're involved .  second, you ask about being organized. this is most difficult to answer because each place or type of business is 'organized' different than the first & others.  there are some standards but what you  might be looking for is not something answered so easily w/in this format.  school project? consult your nearest major industry, ask to speak to someone in production or development & i'm sure they'd be glad to help (providing they understand the focus of your question).  frankly, i don't.

question_title: what creates a black hole? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When a star runs out of fuel, it explodes its outer layer off in a Nova, while the core collapses inwards. Because the continual fusion reaction has stopped, there's nothing to stop the collapse until all of the residual matter presses against each other. This is called a Brown Dwarf.\nIf the star is much larger than our Sun, gravity is so strong that even the matter collapses until the atoms' neucleii press against each other. This is called a Neutron Star.\nIf the star is still larger, not even the neutrons stop the collapse, and gravity causes the whole lot to collapse to a pinpoint. The gravity is still there, sucking in everything around it, even light. This is called a Black Hole.	Science & Mathematics

Since we use sulfuric acid we also add 8 sulfat-ions on both sides and hereby can neutralize the product side:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                         2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH\n\n3) STOCHIOMETRIC BALANCE OF THE ELEMENTS H and O\n\nTaking into consideration that unused protons finally end up as water, we add on the right side 11 H2O and hereby is also reached the balance of oxigen:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                  2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH + 11 H2O\n\nSo now good luck for counting the atoms!

question_title: Compare and contrast index refraction and optical density? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the velocity of light in free space to that in the material.\n\nThe speed of light in free space is the maximum value. Therefore the speed of light in any medium is always less than that of the speed of light in free space.\n\nTherefore refractive index of any material is always greater than one.\n\nIn a given material the refractive index changes for change of frequency of the light wave. The refractive index of violet (High frequency) light will be more than that of red (Low frequency) light.\n\nThe refractive index of a material is greater implies that the speed of light in it will be less. We call this material as optically denser than the material for which the refractive index is less. \n\nFor the same material the density varies with temperature and generally when the density increases the refractive index also increases.

question_title: God is a Spirit? [SEP] question_content: We're all familiar with the Bible verse which says "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worhsip him in spirit and in truth."\n\n But, in Genesis I've found something a bit different.\nGenesis 18:1-4\nAnd the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre; and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day.\nAnd he lift up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him\nand when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and\nbowed himself before the ground\nand said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass\nnot away I pray thee from thy servant.\nLet a little water, I pray you, be fetched and wash your feet and\nrest yourseleves under tree.\n\nIt seems that not only did Abraham SEE God here, but he also thought\nhe was physical enough for his feet to be washed with water.\n\nAnd...in the first verse I mentioned it says God is a Spirit, with a capital S.  Doesn't that mean the Holy Ghost is God?  \n\nSo God is physical yes? [SEP] best_answer: A person needs to read this passage very carefully, and it really helps to read it in the Hebrew. The three men are never actually identified as God. A number of Jewish rabbis have noticed the same thing. It is *first* said that Abraham was sitting in his tent and had a vision of God, *then* he opened his eyes and saw three men. While Moses's narative style sometimes has an overview of events, and then more details, it's hard to say if that's what's happening here or not. In fact, it's almost funny to read if you take the stance that these three were angels in the last half of Genesis, because it has Abraham speaking to the angel that remained behind, and calling him "Adoni" (Lord) but never YHVH. But the one to reply is always YHVY and never Adoni. Also, in Genesis 18:22, it says that the men Abraham was speaking with turned and left, but Abraham stayed and pleaded with the LORD.\n\nBut even if you take the stance that one, or even all three, of these "angels" were in fact God Almighty, there is nothing to keep God Almighty as a spirit from creating a body and animating it himself. St. Augustine gets into that kind of an idea  little bit in one of his 15 books on the Trinity, I don't remember which off the top of my head.	Society & Culture
question_title: What do Christians and non-christians think of Michael and Debbie Pearl? [SEP] question_content: http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/418676.html [SEP] best_answer: Why did you ask for advice about a couple, then post an article about someone who seems to have taken the Pearl's advice to dangerous extremes? This seems unfair.\n\nThe 'pipe' that the Pearl's recommend is soft, flexible plastic water tubing a little over 1/4" wide- almost the kind of tubing you use for aquariums and such- the article makes it sound like lead pipe or PVC plumbing pipe.\n\nI agree with some of the basics at their site, but overall, I am not a fan of the couple or the site. They seem to me to be fanatics in a bad sense of the word.\n\nOddly, it IS NOT their views on spanking or using what amounts to an updated version ofthe willow switch that bugs me the most- it is the commercialism, herbs, and ultra-conservative fundamentalist world-view.\n\nI believe that MILDLY painful stimuli is a powerful learning tool. You see it in real life all the time, and I think it has a role, properly applied, in child-raising. (I never used a switch (or other tool), and never had to do more than a single 'smack' with my 4 kids. Spanking should not be the only or primary tool in your child-rearing toolkit!)\n\nI am horrified at the couple in the article that put such faith in ANY human, then misapply the guy's teachings so grotesquely that death occured. This couple needs psychiatric attention- or if they are mentally OK, needs to be punished for their acts.\n\nThis seems like the blind leading the blind.	Society & Culture

Sorry to say I don't know Krk, but I do know the basics.\n\nI know how it feels when people don't know anything about your country. My partner is from New Zealand, and when we went to the states last year, people seemed to think it was a part of Australia. As it is, people seem to know nothing about us Aussies, which I thought was pretty bad. I can't imagine how frustrating it was being from Croatia and travelling a European country though!

Which one is the "real" life, this "real" life, or the "next" life after death? (I'm not talking about which one is MORE real than another, but which one is the REAL one) [SEP] best_answer: Both are the realities! This life is the qualifying round for the upcoming life, the life after death, the eternal life.  If you see auto racing you will be knowing what and how important is the qualifying round.

[SEP] question_content: I am 24, have 2 jobs - 1 with health benefits, a virgin, have not been living with my parents for 3 years now, not a veteran, not a college graduate, not in the 25 percent tax bracket, and religiously undecided? [SEP] best_answer: Well, I beleive all woman have different veiws of a "Man" and what they should be made of.  I was raised to beleive that a man works hard to support his family and is head of his house hold but knows how to run the house hold not just by demanding respect but by giving it also.  You seem to be off to a pretty good start with being able to work hard to support yourself and possibly someone else you decide to be with.  Women like the idea of stability. . . if you can show a woman that you have this in your life now and that is just as important to you, then she will allow herself to trust you as a man instead of looking at you as someone she will have to work on and "Train" as some of us put it.  Have your own life in order and in such an order that bringing someone else into it will be a smooth transition.  It's about being prepared and letting the woman know that you are capable of handling things.  We all want to feel safe in our lives and it is your job as a MAN to fill that need.  Other wise we spend the rest of our lives running home to daddy because he is the one MAN in our life that we trust and feel safe with.  When you are ready to take on these roles woman will veiw you as a man.\n\nI hope that these few words will help you out.  Good Luck on your path to manhood!!	Society & Culture
question_title: I'm protestant - If I married a Catholic...? [SEP] question_content: -Would our kids have to be Catholic?\n-Would we have to go to "Catholic" pre-marital counseling?\n-What type of ceremony could we have?\n-Has anyone else dealt with the same scenario? (If so, how did you handle it?) [SEP] best_answer: If you want to get married in a catholic church, you will be given all kinds of "conditions" and have to jump through all kinds of hoops to satisfy the priest.  Even after you jump through all the hoops, he might refuse to let you actually walk up the aisle, you might have to stand at the back of the church and get married there.  And the priest also might look and see how much your fiance has donated, and if it is not enough, he might still might not do the ceremony until your fiance satisfies his greed.\n\nUpdate to david_in_mil...:  My brother was one of the people I know that went through it.  He and his wife did all the nonsense the priest demanded, then he told them he would not marry them because he looked at the ledger, and saw no donations from him or his wife.  When they explained that she did not like using envelopes and simply put the money in the collection basket, he said she had no proof, and until they met his price, no wedding.  They went to an Episcopal church and were married there - no nonsense, no problems.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why was the Union fighting at Gettysburg? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the Battle of Gettysburg was never supposed to happen.  It was a battle that accidentally occurred when branches of each army ran into each other.\n\nMore here:\n\nThe greatest battle of the Civil War almost wasn't.  It was not a planned attack; rather the Confederate General Lee had his troops on the move trying to threaten other northern cities.  However, Confederate and Union troops came together at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for three days of the most intense fighting to occur during our country's Civil War.\n\n     The geology of the area around Gettysburg was an important factor of the three days of battle.  A number of ridges that play key roles in the fighting run mostly north and south.  These ridges are diabase sills.   The area is made up of the Piedmont proper, the Triassic basins, the Blue Ridge of Virginia, and the Great Valley.\n\nhttp://www.scsc.k12.ar.us/2000backeast/Trip/Members/CopleyJ/	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: The Islamic clerics that are against the violence are afraid of the repercussions of their "radical stance". \n\nIt's kind of like Yasser Arafat turning down the Israeli's offer of giving him %99 of the demands that he had put out. Even if he had accepted the offer and tried to make peace with Israel, someone in Hamas or Mujahedin would have assasinated him.	Society & Culture

I don't believe God really cares about you being a vegetarian. As for the dominion we have it without slaughtering animals. Adam and Eve never ate meat in the garden of eden only afterwards did God say that you could. So having dominion is control of them(Which we still do).	Society & Culture

question_title: Will Harriet Tubman go to Hell for being deceitful? [SEP] question_content: In case you don't know who she is remember the undergroud railroad. [SEP] best_answer: Harriet was a Christian believer. She honored God above any established law of the government. Just as the Apostles did in their day. \n\nRead this article:\n\nHarriet Tubman\nThe "Moses" of Her People\n\n\n"I always tole God, 'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nIn 1831 a Kentucky slave named Tice Davids made a break for the free state of Ohio by swimming across the Ohio River. His master trailed close behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, Davids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky in a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids "must have gone off on an underground road." The name stuck, and the legend of the underground railroad was born.\n\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a part of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic exploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated "conductor."\n\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland but escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said later, "I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was free. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold through de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven."\n\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 return trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow slaves, boasting "I never lost a passenger." Her guidance of so many to freedom earned her the nickname "Moses."\n\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of her strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of the weak. "I always tole God," she said, "'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her capture, she was never apprehended. "I can't die but once" became her motto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of deliverance.\n\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually going into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to whom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. Slaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be missed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often be late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them missing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired by Tubman would take down.\n\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded strict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his master would likely be forced to reveal information that would compromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a rescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to reconsider.\n\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she replied, "Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough to betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let so many die just for one coward man?"\n\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close with one: "I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. They'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped right up and went on as well as anybody."\n\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led slaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading her. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, "I never met any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God."\n\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and their sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as "one of the best and bravest 	Society & Culture

If you want to learn how to read and write then maybe you can try my approach. Once you have completed the entire program, all 30 lessons, get a dictionary in your target language and start from the very beginning of the program and look up all of the words you hear in the dictionary.

So, should I take a nice sundress and sandals or dressy pants and a top? Or, is a cocktail dress more appropriate? [SEP] best_answer: Resort dressy means something you would wear on vacation to a resort but is fashionable.  You have to pick light fabrics (linen, cotton, rayon, light silk) and avoid the heavy ones (wool, velvet, etc). Your look has to be light and airy. Since you are going to an award dinner, your best bet will be light silk/rayon. Also avoid dark colors since they have no place in a resort.  The safest to wear will be a white airy dress which you can accessorize appropriately.	Society & Culture

question_title: When does someone says enough, after being taken for a fool.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How long it takes you to say 'enough is enough' depends on how much inner strength you have and how much self respect you have.  Hopefully you learn from experience and the next time things go wrong you can get out quicker with your self respect still in tact.  But some people never learn, and some are gluttons for punishment.\nA lot of this comes down to being needy and not having enough going on in your life, which leads you to become dependent on people and to allow them to mess you around.  If you are happy with your life and strong within yourself then you are less likely to invest your valuable time and emotions in people who take you for granted or don't deserve your energy.\nSome people won't cut away from a bad situation for fear of getting hurt or fear of being alone.  Once you realise that to be alone is nothing to fear, and that emotional pain eases with time, then you are not beholden to these fears anymore and you are better equipped to make the difficult decisions in life.\nI hope that everything works out well for you, whatever your troubles may be.  Take care... :)	Society & Culture

question_title: Do you want to here a funny Thanksgiving story? [SEP] question_content: PREGNANT TURKEY STORY:  One year at Thanksgiving, my mom went to my sister's house for  the traditional feast. Knowing how gullible my sister is, my mom decided to play a trick.  She told my sister that she needed something from the store. When my sister left, my mom took the turkey out of the oven, removed the stuffing, stuffed a Cornish hen, inserted it into the turkey, and re-stuffed the turkey. She then placed the bird(s) back in the oven. When it was time for dinner, my sister pulled the turkey out of the oven and proceeded to remove the stuffing. When her serving spoon hit something, she reached in and pulled out the little bird. With a look of total shock on her face, my mother exclaimed: "Patricia, you've cooked a pregnant bird!" At the reality of this horrifying news, my sister started to cry. It took the family two hours to convince her that turkeys lay eggs!!!!!!!! HA HA! [SEP] best_answer: lmao- i should try that on my husband, thanks for the idea.	Society & Culture
