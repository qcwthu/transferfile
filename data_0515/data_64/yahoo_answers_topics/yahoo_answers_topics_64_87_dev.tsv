question_title: Why is it? [SEP] question_content: That when you rent a movie at the begining it always says...\nThis has been formated to fit you tv screen??? [SEP] best_answer: It doesn't always say that. Have you noticed that movie screens at the theatre are very long and rectangular? And that your television screen is more-or-less square? In order to get that rectangular picture to fit into your square screen, they cut off big chunks on the sides. Videos that have not been reformatted are usually labeled "Widescreen". I think they used to call them letter box editions.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: do u change ur gender when in public chat rooms?...do u lie abt ur age and everything else??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Lying about your gender seems downright creepy.  I don't like to give out my age or other personal information to people I don't know and I don't visit chatrooms anymore as there weren't any interesting conversationalists anyway, just over the hill horny guys sending you skanky naked pics of themselves.   \n\nI think a lot of people do make up information about themselves when they go into chatrooms and they don't consider it lying because they don't ever intend on seeing the person face to face, or they consider it "trying on a new personality".    They don't realize that some people they are communicating with take them as being for real and may hurt a real person's feelings.  \n\nMy personal advice is if you visit a chatroom, look at it as a form of entertainment to pass your time, but don't really think you are going to meet a good friend or soulmate through that venue.  It is hard enough getting to really know someone face-to-face, let alone through an electronic medium.	Entertainment & Music
question_title: What have the TV networks GAINED by putting their logos onscreen during shows? [SEP] question_content: It's been 13 years since Fox started ruining their shows by putting their logo onscreen- first for a couple minutes then eventually all the time.  The other networks followed, with ABC being the last 8 years ago.  As a result, I very rarely watch TV anymore.  I've heard all the reasons for doing this but I don't accept any of them- if there's a logo on the screen for more than 5 seconds, the channel goes off my TV, simple as that.\nThe networks have lost my viewership over this and tarnished their history, yet it still goes on.  What have they GAINED by ruining their picture this way?  I don't want any more theories, only specific FACTS.  Have they made ratings go up, or caused more people to want to watch?\nBonus question- how do the people who work on the shows feel about this?  I know The Simpsons people don't like it.  I would refuse to work for any show unless it was presented logo-free on TV. [SEP] best_answer: Quick, name the first three networks that pop into your head!\n\nIts called "Mind share". Think of your memory as real estate. Each network is trying to take over as much real estate as possible. The more often you see a brand, the more likely you will recall it.\n\nMind share has nothing to do with cost, quality or performance. For example when people were asked to name five automotive companies Ford & Toyota were among the top five and Porsche was only mentioned by about 6% of those polled.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which is the better team, Justice League of America or the Avengers? [SEP] question_content: Right, now the teams would be the original line-ups:\nJLA - Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Black Canary and the Flash\nAvengers - Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Ant-man and Wasp.\nWhich is the better team? [SEP] best_answer: Avengers by a LONG shot.\n\nany one of the big three could take out superman. No correct that, any ONE of the avengers could take out superman. Ant man and wasp, as corny as they are could just fly into his ear and rip him apart from the inside- he is defenseless.\n\nThat leaves green lantern and martian manhunter.\n\nWhile Iron Man's original suit pales in comparison to his power now (he could likely handle the original justice league by himself pretty easily post Extremis storyline), it is made of yellow. Green lantern is ineffective against him.\n\nThat would leave either thor or the hulk to take out martian manhunter, best bet would be to use thor because of his godlike status and hulk could likely be mind controlled to becoming bruce banner, thus taking him out of the fight.\n\nThe flash vs the hulk? The flash is an annoying personality to begin with, what happens when that adds to the fact that the hulk is a no contest match in favor of the hulk to begin with, flash's best bet would be to run away as far and fast as possible and hope hulk doesn't land on him when he jumps after him. \n\nThe last is aqua man and black canary. This is not the aquaman of today, but the aquaman of way back when when basically all he did was talk to fish and black canary,  both of these are a non-issue. leaving wasp or ant man would take out one, and the other marvel heroes would have handily dispatched thier dc counterpart (except possibly thor, because mm can run and hide longer) to handle a human black canary or weakling aquaman.

question_title: Does anyone know the value of a collection of National Geographic Magazines?? [SEP] question_content: I have every issue from January 1964 through November 1970 except for the September 1969 issue, I'm still trying to find it.  The October and November issues are still in their paper mailing wrap, never been opened.  All issues are in great shape and even include various add-in's such as special maps and even a 45 record about going to the moon in a 1968 issue.  There are no bent pages or torn pages, as a matter of fact they look as if they have never been looked at.  I just wonder what kind of value they might have if I decide to sell them. [SEP] best_answer: If they are in such good shape, the value might be considerable.  I would take a few of the most interesting/oldest to a dealer in old magazines, or an antiques and curios store if you don't know a dealer in "ephemera," as they are called.  It might even be worth it to list them on eBay.  I think they are probably well past the flea market level of value, at the very least.\n\nGood luck!	Entertainment & Music

question_title: can i ask you guys a question i never really got the answer to? [SEP] question_content: are zebras black with white stripes or white with black stripes? i never really knew the answer and someone i knew asked me and i didn't know. can you guys help me so i could tell her. lol. [SEP] best_answer: According to a biology site:\n\n"It is generally believed that zebras are dark animals with white stripes where the pigmentation is inhibited. The pigment of the hair is found solely in the hair and not in the skin. The reasons for thinking that they were originally pigmented animals are that (1) white horses would not survive well in the African plains or forests; (2) there used to be a fourth species of zebra, the quagga (which was overeaten to extinction in the eighteen hundreds). The quagga had the zebra striping pattern in the front of the animal, but had a dark rump; (3) when the region between the pigmented bands becomes too wide, secondary stripes emerge, as if suppression was weakening."\n\nhttp://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=1&id=5	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Why do men like bitchy women?? Do they find it attractive to have a girl with her nose in the air?? [SEP] question_content: I think this all the time! \n\n"Why do men like bitchy girls??" I just don't understand! Why would u want a girl that is rude to u and probably doesn't even respect u?? Like me, I'm a nice girl in general, but I CAN be a b*tch. I'm only a b*tch if u piss me off. However, men want a girl that has a stank attitude ALL the time. I'm pretty, but I'm not an all-around rude person! Sometimes I think that's why I don't get hit on alot.\n\nAnywayz, I have not the slightest idea. I don't know if they think that's attractive or something, but if I were a guy, I wouldn't want some stuck-up, snotty, b*tch. I'd want a sweet, nice girl. Not a girl who has her nose in the air. I'm the same way for guys too! I don't care how sexy u r. You'd just better not be a rude, jackass! LOL!\n\nWhat do you think?? Why do u think men like snotty girls? [SEP] best_answer: If by bitchy, you mean a girl who knows her own worth and will not allow anyone to run over her and will tell you when she thinks you have disrespected her, men like this kind of woman because she challenges him to be his best.  He knows that if he wants this better kind of woman, he must be thoughtful of her feelings, work hard for a living because she will not just accept any excuse for a man, have plans for his future (which will not necessarily include her if their plans do not match) and be a man not an excuse for 1.  If you mean a girl who is rude and crude for the heck of it, it is because he is stupid.    By the By, if you feel that you must always agree with your bf or risk losing him, I feel sorry for you	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Does any one know if eminem is ever going to come out with a new album? and when? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes.  Eminem has currently finished work on his new compilation CD, "The Re-Up," a collection of songs by new Shady artists, including a few new tracks of his own.  It will be released this December.\n\nTechnically, however, that's not an "Eminem album," per se.  Rather, it is a hodgepodge of various artists signed to the Shady record label contributing to one CD, in what is best described as a "collaboration album" designed to promote the new artists, and get Eminem back under the spotlight.  I have heard, though, that Eminem IS rumored to be working on a follow-up album to his 1996 independent release, "Infinite," entitled, "Infinite 2."  But to my knowledge, that's still unconfirmed.

[SEP] question_content: if a person is did mpd is it true that the core of the system can be killed? my friend and i have argued about thhis for a long time.. [SEP] best_answer: I have Dissociative Identity Disorder and I have since I was in Kindergarten.  What do you mean the "core" can be killed?  Do you mean intergration?  I've intergrated 2 of my personalities into myself and have 3 left (including me - 4).  Do you mean, I can die and one of the others take over my life?  My core as you say is strong enough now that it won't ever be "beaten down or die" to one of my alts.  However, I have to say, yes, an alternate personality can kill you physically and themselves in the process.  Often alternate personality's feel guilt about 'being there' almost like they caused you to fracture in the first place and take that anger at themselves and misplace it.  By acting in self-destructive manners they can destroy themeselves and you.  Thats why good psychotheraphy is so important, if not critical.  \n\nAs far as the alternate killing the core and 'taking' over, I think your friend watches too many soap operas.	Health

[SEP] question_content: some time it shrinks to normal size but some time it expands, it did'tcause any pain .\nwhen i got up in the morning its normal but when i do some excersize it expands as i feel some thing coming out from the upper paret of the penis. [SEP] best_answer: Typically, during the day, the testicles will enlarge slightly and after a good sleep they will reduce. This has more to do with blood flow and related factors than any kind of illness or problem.\n\nHowever, if things are bulging out in the area or the penis as well as some swelling, it could be a sign of an inguinal or lower abdominal hernia and a quick check by the doctor will confirm this or refute it.\n\nWhile it could be normal, it would definitely be wise to get ti checked just in case.

SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY. PS. we've been together a loonnngg time and use protection some times. [SEP] best_answer: Soap can irritate you (wash the vaginal area only with water). Any natural vaginal secretions are washed away in the shower, tub, pool , hot tub, ocean.......I don't think the end of your period has a think to do with it.

question_title: Why is death so scary? [SEP] question_content: I don't know why but I am 22 years old and yet it seems that death scares me so much.  I actually will not normally have a conversation with someone about death.  I can't stand when my family starts to talk about there wishes when they pass, I actualy normally get up and leave the room.  There has also been times if I am home alone and in bed about to go to sleep, that I will just start to think about the fact that everyone dies and I don't know why but I can't stand the thought of thinking that, that is it, you find someone that you dearly love, you do all of these accomplishments, and that is just it, you die.  It scares me so much, that I will break down and cry for hours, and then I will be extremely upset for a few days, and then I just stop thinking about it until I start thinking about it again.  I mean why does it scare me so much, I can't figure out why exactly other then that just being it, we go away?  How can I get over it scaring me so much?  HELP PLEASE, SERIOUS ANSWERS!! [SEP] best_answer: Death scares us all.  It is also a fact of life.  If we did not have an instinctual fear of death, we would not survive as a species.  The way you describe your fears sounds like it is more about being left alone, and you may want to talk with a counselor about that issue.  Loss is a big source of pain for all of us.  Perhaps you have lost a beloved relative or friend, and you hate that feeling.  Or maybe you are very attached to an older relative, and you cannot imagine life without him or her.  Talk to a mental health professional about your specific fears and associations with death.  If you are religious, you can also talk to our clergy. This is a VERY COMMON fear.  But you deserve relief, and counseling can help.	Health

question_title: was diabetes not existant 100 years back? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The term diabetes (Greek: διαβήτης) was coined by Aretaeus of Cappadocia. It is derived from the Greek διαβαίνειν, diabaínein that literally means "passing through," or "siphon," a reference to one of diabetes' major symptoms—excessive urine production. \n\nIn 1675 Thomas Willis added mellitus from the Latin word for honey (mel in the sense of "honey sweet") when he noted that the blood and urine of a diabetic has a sweet taste. This had been noticed long before in ancient times by the Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, and Indians.\n\n In 1776 Matthew Dobson confirmed the sweet taste was because of an excess of a kind of sugar in the urine and blood of people with diabetes	Health

question_title: worse? cigars or cigs? [SEP] question_content: I smoke 10 cigars a week. (pack of 10 hamlets) how much worse than smoking 10 cigaretees a day is that if at all? [SEP] best_answer: Gee, that's like asking which is worse, being stabbed to death or being beaten to death?  The result is still the same.\n\nPeople often think cigars are safer because you don't (at least, you aren't supposed to) inhale the smoke.  But you are still exposing your lungs to the smoke in the room created by the lit cigar.  You are still burning your tastebuds, dulling your sense of smell and contaminating your mouth, lips, gums, teeth and fingers.  \n\nBy comparison, the cigarette is much smaller, lasts far less time and although it is inhaled directly into the lungs, it is still doing the same number on your mouth, lips, gums, teeth, fingers and tongue.  But even though the amount of time it takes to consume a cigarette may seem more appealing, cigarette smokers tend to smoke their cancer sticks much more frequently than when a cigar smoker lights up.  It's almost as if the cigarette smoker is trying to play catchup to the cigar smoker.  Neither is good for you.  Both can cause ulcers of the mouth and tongue - even if you never develop cancer.

question_title: is there a home remedy to get well water color(minerals and such) out of hair? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have heard that some people use a vinegar rinse, which we know works on removing mineral deposits on coffee pots and humidifiers. I know it smells awful, but maybe if, after pouring a cup on your hair, leaving it on for about 5 minutes, rinsing then shampooing twice, it might not be so bad. Do this treatment once a month, before perming, or before coloring your hair. I used to have well water, but I used a commercial de-mineralizer to remove the minerals before I dyed or permed my hair. Check with your local hair salon for what they use. I know they're pricey, but it smells better than vinegar. Aussie brand used to have a citrifier, which is a de-mineralizer, but it has been removed from the market (bummer...it worked really good too). I checked on the internet with Aussie and they said they won't be replacing it (bigger bummer). It was very low priced too. Hope this helps. <*)))><	Health

I was on lithium and hated the side effects (was taking paxil too). I talked to my doctor and was switched to Lamictal. As your doctor switches you it is done slowly so your body adjusts, but doesn't take THAT long (I took 6 weeks to completely switch.) \n\nI don't recommend doing it yourself. Without the mood stabilizer you might find you become extremely manic or depressed and start cycling. This is especially true if you stay on the anti-depressent. If you didn't like your doctor before, find a new one and make it clear you want to switch. All the doctors I have gone to were happy to get me off meds I didn't like, especially lithium because it is dangerous. Good Luck!	Health

question_title: What is Pilomatrix Carcinoma? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pilomatrix Carcinoma:\n\nPilomatrixoma, also known as pilomatricoma, and calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, is an uncommon benign tumor of hair matrix origin.  Malherbe and Cheantais first described the lesion in 1880 and originally believed the lesion was a benign tumor of the sebaceous glands.  The lesions typically occur on the head and neck and are more common in females.  There are two peaks of occurrence with age.  The first is before the third decade, with greater than 60% occurring at this time.  The second is during the sixth and seventh decades (3).  Histologically, pilomatrixomas are characterized by irregularly shaped islands of small basaloid epithelial cells.  The basaloid cells generally have small uniform nuclei and scant cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders surrounded by fibrillary material.  Also often noted are a variable degree of squamous differentiation and sheets of ghost cells that occasionally are mixed with stroma containing multinucleated giant cells.  \n\nCalcifications may or may not be conspicuous.  Pilomatrix carcinoma is an exceedingly rare locally aggressive and destructive tumor that usually arises from a pilomatrixoma.    Bony invasion and occasional distant metastases have been reported (2).  The carcinoma is more common in males than females, with a ratio of 2:1 in a review of 72 cases in the literature (2).  Imaging studies such as MRI or CT may be useful to evaluate pilomatrix carcinoma that does not respond to wide local excision with negative margins.  Histologically, Pilomatrix carcinoma is characterized by more numerous and atypical mitoses, nuclear atypia, tumor necrosis, and infiltration into subcutaneous fat, blood vessels, nerve and muscle.  Aggressive wide local excision is required for treatment.	Health

question_title: Is diabetes reversible? [SEP] question_content: Type 2 [SEP] best_answer: It depends. Mostly on a lot of stuff we only dimily understand. But yes, sometimes, sort of.\n\nIn the case of type 2, the situation is more or less as follows. \n\nThe characteristic problem in type 2 is that most o fhte body's cells have decided, more or less, to stop responding to insulin in its glucose uptake function control role. Why this should be is now somewhat understood (ie, we think we see the mechanisms inside the cell, but not much more), but we don't know why there is so much variation from one patient to another. Some type 2s have only a slightly elevated glucose levels. Some rather more and some are completely out of control. \n\nPart of the reason for the variation appears to be due to the amount of abdominal fat present (around the organs there). This fat, but not it seems thunder thighs, or double chins, or love handles, is very active. It produces a variety (that we've found so far) of signalling chemicals --  to everyone's surprise, and also seems to be characteristically inflammed (ie, the immunological reaction). Losing even a small amount of that fat seems to reduce the severity of the inflammation and often of type 2, especially in less severe patients. Not always of course. And exercise generally helps muscle cells absorb glucose with or without insulin. And reducing the amount of glucose that has to be handled is good too. \n\nSo, if you're a borderline type 2 diabetic, you might be able to go back to something like normal blood glucose control if you exercise, lose enough weight to reduce the amount of fat in and around your abdominal organs, and keep your food intake reasonable. Lots of carbohydrate (sugary soda included) will break down into glucose and be absorbed into the blood, fat in the diet will end up stored in various places around the body, including the abdomen, and so on. \n\nIf your situation is not very severe, and you diet and exercise proeprly, you might be able to get back to normal. But, the underlying condition remains. You may not be able to stay normal no matter what you do, and if you gain weight or stop exercising or stop eating right, it is likely to come back. \n\nWhy all of thsi works the way it does is quite obscure. It's clear there is a strong genetic component to type 2, but it's not enough, for not every one with the genetic background gets type 2. And people with no genetic history in their family do get type 2. Much research is under way attempting to make sense of this, but it's a hard problem.	Health
question_title: How popular is the South Beach diet? [SEP] question_content: Is there some survey or website that talks about which fad diets are the most popular? [SEP] best_answer: One way to judge a diet's popularity is to see how the book sales rank on Amazon.com. You can check out the latest Amazon best-seller inforrmation at \nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/books/all/\n\nHowever, book sales numbers don't mean much, because diets go through fad cycles. An author will sell a zillion copies of his book one month, and then another diet will be the rage the next month. South Beach has gone through that same cycle, and it's not as popular now as it was when it first came out.\n\nIt got a big publicity boost in 2004, when ex-President Clinton lost about 30 pounds on the South Beach Diet. Then it lost some of its appeal a few weeks later when he had to have heart surgery. Some nutritionists think South Beach is healthy.\n\nMake up your own mind after reading some internet forum discussions about the SBD.

question_title: name two types of cast? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What is a cast?\nA cast holds a broken bone in place as it heals. Casts also help to prevent or decrease muscle contractions, and are effective at providing immobilization, especially after surgery. \nCasts immobilize the joint above and the joint below the area that is to be kept straight and without motion. For example, a child with a forearm fracture will have a long arm cast to immobilize the wrist and elbow joints.\n\nWhat are casts made of?\nThe outside, or hard part of the cast, is made from two different kinds of casting materials. \nplaster - white in color. \nfiberglass - comes in a variety of colors, patterns, and designs. \nCotton and other synthetic materials are used to line the inside of the cast to make it soft and to provide padding around bony areas, such as the wrist or elbow.\nHope this helps!!!

question_title: Tips for writing compositions? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Here are a couple:\n\nBefore submitting a final draft of anything, double-check spelling, grammar, syntax, and all that.  The spell-check feature in a word processor is useful, but even it can make mistakes (it may misread the context of something and consequently make inappropriate changes), so I highly recommend getting someone to proof-read for you.  Even if you're good about spelling and grammar, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes, as there's a good chance they'll catch something that you wouldn't.\n\nLet's see, what else? Vary your diction.  Using the same words or phrases over and over again can bore a reader.  A thesaurus can be helpful (and if you don't have one, thesaurus.com is just as good).  But don't rely on it too heavily.  Some folks do this, and it really shows.  Their sentences end up sounding really forced, and not natural at all.  Also, the nuances of a word are important, and so it's important to choose a synonym with just the right flavor.  Cultivate your own creativity.\n\nThose are two areas where folks my age, at least, seem to run into problems.  There's lots more to be said on the subject, but if you're just seeking general tips, those two should take you a long way.  If you're writing a scholarly paper, I would suggest you get ahold of an MLA Handbook, if you don't have one already.\n\nhttp://www.mla.org/style\n\nBest of luck to you!	Education & Reference

His early achievements, as composer and performer, show him to be extending the Viennese Classical tradition that he had inherited from Mozart and Haydn. As personal affliction – deafness, and the inability to enter into happy personal relationships – loomed larger, he began to compose in an increasingly individual musical style, and at the end of his life he wrote his most sublime and profound works. From his success at combining tradition and exploration and personal expression, he came to be regarded as the dominant musical figure of the 19th century, and scarcely any significant composer since his time has escaped his influence or failed to acknowledge it. For the respect his works have commanded of musicians, and the popularity they have enjoyed among wider audiences, he is probably the most admired composer in the history of Western music.

question_title: What does yes mean? [SEP] question_content: what does yes mean [SEP] best_answer: YES\nYes is a common English word indicating agreement or acceptance. It is the opposite of no. It is often replaced by "yeah", "yep" (with various spellings, including "yup"), "uh-huh,", "ayuh", (generally used only in Maine) or "aye".\n\nThe word "yes" comes from the Old English gése, gíse, gýse (pronounced with a palatized g which was represented by a yogh), with the literal meaning of so be it!. From géa + sī, the present subjunctive of to be (be it!). Géa, (possibly meaning thus), is from the Proto-Germanic *ja or *je, with the meaning of yes or truly.[1]\n\nThe words "aye" and "yea" are used for "yes" in some contexts. 'Aye' is more common in Scotland and the north of England. It may also be used in meetings: 'All who agree say "aye"'. 'Aye' is also a nautical way of saying 'yes'. 'Aye, Aye' means I hear the command, I understand it, and will obey it. 'Yea' is archaic. The King James Bible always uses 'yea' and never 'yes'.\n\nIn English, "yes" is also used to answer a negative question or statement, an example of "yes" used to disagree with a question or statement is:\n\nThe questions "You don’t want it, do you?" and "Don’t you want it?" can be answered by "yes" if the respondent does want the item, and "no" if he or she does not. However, other words are used when the answer needs to be clearly delineated, as in "Of course I want it," or "No, not at all." Many languages use a different word for this purpose. For example, German has "doch" for this purpose (rather than "ja"), French uses "si" (rather than "oui") and Norwegian uses "jo" or "jau".	Education & Reference

question_title: how to build a fast succesful fire? [SEP] question_content: the title explains it [SEP] best_answer: In a fireplace or outside?  Outside, gas usually get things moving quickly, although, if the wood is wet, gasoline doesn't do much.  When I have started bonfires outside with wet wood, I've made a big pile of wood and put one duraflame log on each side of the pile.  That helped to get things going and the duraflame logs burn long enough to really keep things going.\n\nIn a fire place, you really need to start with small kindling, like pine cones, small dry twigs, medium sized dry sticks, and then let that catch on.  Put large pieces of wood around it, but not big logs.  You have to start small and build up around that.\n\nOther things that work good to get a fire started, you can roll up newspaper, soak it in molten candle wax, then let it dry.  That works out as a good, solid way to get the fire going.  They also sell things in WalMart and places like that that are like Duraflame logs, only much smaller.  Its really just sawdust soaked with wax.  It gets a fire started pretty good too.	Education & Reference

question_title: Dyslexia is Not due to what factors or behaviors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Dyslexia refers to a different learning style for reading and writing not associated with obvious problems such as bad eyesight, poor hearing, low intelligence or behavioural problems. The term Dyslexia means 'difficulty with the lexicon'. Although it can be caused by brain damage (usually referred to as 'Alexia'), the majority of Dyslexics show no evidence of brain trauma. It is believed that Dyslexia is the result of developmental differences in the brain. Studies have shown that often there are other family members who show and have shown similar difficulties, which suggests a genetic or developmental cause of the condition. Dyslexia, as a condition, can show a pronounced difference between individuals, from being very mild to severe. It is not restricted to childhood but can continue throughout a persons life. Nor is it restricted to one sex. Male Dyslexics, however, may show different symptoms to females. Dyslexics may also show a difference depending on which written language they are using, (for example there may be a difference between a Dyslexic who uses English to one who uses Japanese).\n\nProblems can include a persons difficulty with reading and writing, poor short term memory for sequences, (for example numbers), and a 'confused' use of their hands (for example ambidextrous people often show signs of Dyslexia). In addition, occasionally males will show a slower development of language skills in the early part of their lives. Dyslexias include the inability to name letters, to read words or sentences, or to recognize words directly even though they can be sounded out. Dyslexia is not limited to reversing the order of letters in reading or writing, as is often implied in popular culture; it may, for instance, include unexpected spelling mistakes (including phonetic spelling in English) and unusual syntax, and may be associated with dyscalculia. Most theories focus on nonprimary areas in the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.[1] Studies have linked several forms of dyslexia to genetic markers[2][3][4].\n\nread more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia\n\nand just to show you what it looks like......( i have been dyslexic for 30 years.....)\n\n\nI cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid Aoccdrnig to rscheearch taem at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae.

question_title: how can i recover gold from a cpu? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The process of recovering gold from electronics circuits is relatively simple, but also quite expensive to set up.\n\nEquipment required includes a DC power source capable of delivering several amperes of current at approximately 12 to 100 VDC.  ( A DC Arc Welding Power supply will work well here. )\n\nThen the material containing the gold to be extracted must be crushed.  Crushing multi-layer fiberglass circuit boards is difficult, but it must be done to expose as much of the gold as possible.\n\nA solution of water and some Gold Salt should be mixed.  Gold Sulfate is probably the cheapest, but it is STILL very expensive.  The solution should be in the range of 0.5 gram per litre.\n\nObtain a tank or container made of conductive metal.  Copper is best.  Place the crushed material in the tank,\nPour in the Gold Salt solution until crushed material is completely covered. Attach the POSITIVE anode of the power supply to the tank.  Attach the NEGATIVE cathode of the powersupply to a small piece of gold wire or gold goin or jewelry ( Just a seed to get the thing started . ) And immerse this negative lead in the solution, being careful NOT to let it touch the tank or the crushed material.\n\nTurn on the power...And walk way...The Gold from the crushed material will be 'deposited' on the Cathode gradually over time.  The more current you are able to safely supply without burning something up, the faster the process will be.	Computers & Internet

question_title: does anyone know how to delete an operating system (windows xp) from a laptop? [SEP] question_content: I caught a virus on my laptop and had to reinstall windows. the first attempt wiped everything out but I had purchased a faulty disk and it was not complete. I purchased a new disk and it installed beautifully. Now I have two operating systems on my computer at the startup. Do you know how to delete the partial one and leave the whole one? It is on and emachine if that helps. [SEP] best_answer: The best thing to do in this case is for you to reformat like the others have suggested and install a fresh copy of XP but if you have never done this it might throw you at first. With your machine on, stick in your copy of XP in then reboot. Then after it starts to reboot it will ask you "press any key to boot from CD" Press any key at this point and then wait for it to inspect your systems hardware then it will load some common drivers etc. After that it will look to see if you have any previous versions installed. When it shows you those other versions it will ask you if you want to continue installing Windows on this drive or something like that. At this point you want to get rid of the previous versions and any partitions. If you read carefully you can delete any other versions and/ or partitions and then install a fresh copy of XP. Make sure that you have gotten rid of all other OS's and partitions and if you have it will say "to install on this partition press enter" and you should see "new(raw)" and then however many MB's your drive is. At this point press enter and it will ask you "install XP NTFS or install XP NTFS(quick). Use the first one "install XP NTFS" Press enter and it will start to format the drive and then let it install XP and your all set.	Computers & Internet

question_title: why organisms of the same specie can be different from one to another? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mutation generates differences.  Most mutations are deleterious and natural selection tends to eliminate them quickly.  Many are neutral and are retained to some degree because there's nothing weeding them out.  A few are positive and variation is also lost in that case because selection will eliminate the other variations.\n\nThere is a process called frequency dependent selection whereby a trait is advantageous but only if its rare.  For example since hosts adapt to a certain kind of parasite, it is advantageous for a parasite to have rare characteristics.  That way the host is unlikely to have seen that model before and the parasite is likely to be successful.  In that case selection actually favors a lot of versions in a species because as soon as anything become really numerous it becomes deleterious.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How does gravity effect the period of a spring? [SEP] question_content: ok: you have a spring attached to the wall and resting horizontally on a table with a block attached. when you pull the block away and let it go, it undergoes simple harmonic motion.\nNow imagine you move this apparatus to mars, with 1/2 the gravity of earth\nwhat happens to the period of oscillation of the box? [SEP] best_answer: Assuming their is no frictional drag between the table and the block, the only interaction here is between the block (a mass), and the spring, and neither knows nor cares whether they are on Earth, on Mars, or in middle space. The block is a mass to be moved by the restorative force of the stretched or compressed spring, and the spring's restoration force does not depend on where it is, nor does the mass of the block change with location. So the period of motion will remain the same. If this were a problem of vertical motion where the block was being lifted against the force of gravity, then the problem would be different.

[SEP] question_content: What factors have caused the popularity of Islamic fundamentalist movements in the Middle East and North Africa? [SEP] best_answer: The biggest factor is the meddling by the US in political and social affairs in the ME.  Most of this came from our incessant need to control nations that have OIL.  We need oil and will do anything to get it.\nWe overthrew and then had killed the Iranian leader Mossadegh and put the Shah in his place.  The Shah was a puppet of the US govt.  THAT is why Iran hates us.\nHowever, the next biggest factor is our unreasoning support of Israel, who was given Arab land and was forced on its neighbors in 1947.

question_title: Which came first the DNA or the RNA? [SEP] question_content: The DNA is needed for protein synthesis, and the RNA is much shorter than DNA so it must have been created first. Please help, my profs. won't tell me the answer, they just smile. [SEP] best_answer: DNA, RNA, PNA; stepping backwards in time\n\nAll life on earth appears to share the same origins; except for a few very simple forms,  the business of replication is currently coded on the famous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule, a genotype of great length,  but surprisingly simple structure. The work of transforming the information stored in DNA into the machinery of life is currently carried out by various forms of ribonucleic acid, RNA.   We try to find answers to the mystery of how this all came about by asking questions:\n\nRibonucleic Acid - RNA and its precursors\n\nQ) When did DNA enter the picture and under what chemical circumstances did it develop? \n\nA) There is considerable evidence that there was a period of time on Earth called the RNA world. In this world life existed as RNA as both phenotype and genotype. The RNA life form could have been a single naked strand, a collection of RNAs or RNA accompanied by a suite of cofactors (e.g. peptides, membranes, mineral surfaces, etc.). This process has not yet been fully elaborated, but is at the heart of the field of molecular biology and chemistry. \n\nThe reasons it is believed that there was an RNA world is summarized by NSCORT's Gerald Joyce in the journal Nature, Vol. 338 (1989) pp. 217-224. But it boils down to the following seven reasons: \n\nRNA has a template structure (i.e. Watson/Crick). \nRNA has catalytic properties (the ribozymes of Cech and many others). \nRNA appears in various presumably ancient cellular processes (i.e. ribosome, primer for DNA, etc.). \nRibonucleotides are components of many coenzymes (e.g. CoA, NADH, etc.). \nThe biosynthesis of histidine is uses ATP and PRPP. \nThe biosynthesis of deoxynucleotides is from ribonucleotide diphosphates. \nThe biosynthesis of dTMP is from dUMP. \nSince the RNA in the RNA world is alive, it is assumed that RNA evolved into DNA through some sort of genetic takeover event. In other words, RNA enzymes made DNA, which replaced it in the genome. Proteins were added into the mix at some point. This has never been explained in detail. \n\nThe problem is where did RNA come from? It is a VERY complex and delicate molecule. Some of the problems with RNA are discussed by Antonio Lazcano and Stanley Miller in the journal Cell, Vol. 85 (1996) pp. 793-798. In short, here is the problem: \n\n Ribose is hard to make prebiotically, is in equilibrium with the various anomeric forms, has numerous chiral centers, and decomposes very fast. \n It is very hard to make nucleosides prebiotically. \n It is very hard to prebiotically phosphorylate things (nucleosides). \n It is hard to polymerize activated NTPs with information and reasonable fidelity in a 3’-5’ manner (2’-5’ is more favorable). \n\nIt has thus been assumed that there was a much simpler informational macromolecule than RNA. It has been dubbed preRNA (or pre-RNA). This molecule may have been achiral and may have used bases other than AUGC. An example of an alternative backbone is PNA (P.E. Nielsen (1993) Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere 23:323-327.) Some alternative bases are described by M.P. Robertson and S.L. Miller (1995) Science 268:702-705 and V.M. Kolb, J.P. Dworkin, and S.L. Miller (1994) Journal of Molecular Evolution 38:549-557. PreRNA is alive and its enzymes (prenozymes?) would be able to make the RNA which would replace it. The preRNA may have assembled from the prebiotic environment, or there may have been pre-preRNA around to help. \n\nNow, why couldn’t DNA have been made by preRNA? The 5 of the 7 reasons for the RNA world listed above are based on MODERN biochemistry and reasons 1 and 2 apply to DNA as well as to RNA. Much happened between the origin of life and the last common ancestor, and it is hard to accept extrapolations across such an immense time span.  There are some chemical reasons 2-deoxyribose might be a more likely candidate than ribose as well. \n\nThus to finally answer the question, DNA entered the sc	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does the reversal of the Sun's magnetic field have any effect on the Earth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Sun has a roughly 11-year sunspot cycle, however, with the ending of each cycle, the polarity of the Sun's magnetic field reverses so that the North magnetic pole becomes the South and vice versa. Every 22 years we end up with the polarity returned to its 'previous' state. There have been many studies of what happens to Earth's weather when these flips occur, but to my knowledge, there has been no conclusive evidence that polarity reversal does much of anything. \nhowever for a given hemisphere, the overall magnetic polarity does not return to its previous polarity for 22 years; the Hale Cycle. It takes the Sun 22 years for the polarity in a given hemisphere to return to the same state.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGood Luck.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: how many times must the first cell divide in order to form a human? [SEP] question_content: By my calculations, if there are 10 billion cells in the body, then the origional fertalized egg must divide, and then each of the 2 divide etc. But only 35 or so generations should be sufficient to produce 10 billion cells. Averaging pregnancy at 270 days, each cell generation must double itself around every 10 days. This to me seems to be wrong, Anything i am not taking into account? [SEP] best_answer: The first cell "must" divide only once but "may" divide almost without end during the life of a creature.  When the first cell divides its DNA splits like cutting the rungs of several (helical) ladders (genes) and each ladder half then regenerates its missing half in the new cells.  After the split, which is the original cell?  If one of the two "new" cells died prematurely, the remaining cell would likely carry on.  After only a few cell divisions, cells differentiate and become specialized and no longer are capable of producing all the tissue types required.  The original cell is lost for practical purposes.

question_title: when you boil water, why dont all of the bubbles boil out before all of the water is gone? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The bubbles are actually bubbles of steam, not air.  Because of tiny bumps on the bottom of the pan, there are spots where the water gets hotter than in other spots, and it turns to steam bubbles.  These bubbles collect together and float up to the surface, where they "pop" and actually cool the water down a tiny bit.  This cooler (less hot) water sinks to the bottom, gets heated up into steam again, bubbles form, and so on.  So the bubbles won't boil out before the water is gone, because it's the water itself that's making the bubbles.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: > What is the Biological Basis of Consciousness? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: MATTER: THE OTHER NAME FOR ILLUSION\n\nIT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT THE WORLD COMES INTO EXISTENCE IN OUR BRAINS\n\nWe acknowledge that all the individual features of the world are experienced through our sense organs. The information that reaches us through those organs is converted into electrical signals, and the individual parts of our brain analyze and process these signals. After this interpreting process takes place inside our brain, we will, for example, see a book, taste a strawberry, smell a flower, feel the texture of a silk fabric or hear leaves shaking in the wind. \nWe have been taught that we are touching the cloth outside of our body, reading a book that is 30 cm (1 ft) away from us, smelling the trees that are far away from us, or hearing the shaking of the leaves that are far above us. However, this is all in our imagination. All of these things are happening within our brains. \nAt this point we encounter another surprising fact; that there are, in fact, no colors, voices or visions within our brain. All that can be found in our brains are electrical signals. This is not a philosophical speculation. This is simply a scientific description of the functions of our perceptions. In her book Mapping The Mind, Rita Carter explains the way we perceive the world as follows:\n\nEach one [of the sense organs] is intricately adapted to deal with its own type of stimulus: molecules, waves or vibrations. But the answer does not lie here, because despite their wonderful variety, each organ does essentially the same job: it translates its particular type of stimulus into electrical pulses. A pulse is a pulse is a pulse. It is not the colour red, or the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth—it is a bit of electrical energy. Indeed, rather than discriminating one type of sensory input from another, the sense organs actually make them more alike. \nAll sensory stimuli, then enter the brain in more or less undifferentiated form as a stream of electrical pulses created by neurons firing, domino-fashion, along a certain route. This is all that happens. There is no reverse transformer that at some stage turns this electrical activity back into light waves or molecules. What makes one stream into vision and another into smell depends, rather, on which neurons are stimulated.1 \n\nIn other words, all of our feelings and perceptions about the world (smells, visions, tastes etc.) are comprised of the same material, that is, electrical signals. Moreover, our brain is what makes these signals meaningful for us, and interprets these signals as senses of smell, taste, vision, sound or touch. It is a stunning fact that the brain, which is made of wet meat, can know which electrical signal should be interpreted as smell and which one as vision, and can convert the same material into different senses and feelings.

One way is to use the quadratic formula and the other way is to factor. I've been leaning toward factoring because I thought it would be easier, but I'm still having trouble. Can someone tell me a good way to factor? Or should I just forget factoring and study the quadratic formula? [SEP] best_answer: Using an equation is the lazy, mechanical way to do it. If you want to understand what's going on, factor it if possible.\n\nIf you *really* want to know what's going on, derive the quadratic formula yourself. It isn't as hard as it looks, and it can be done on one page.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: gas lawssssssssss? [SEP] question_content: When playing basketball on an unusually warm spring day, you notice that the ball is very firm and bounces well. On a very cold day a week later, the ball is not as firm making it difficult to dribble. why did this happen? [SEP] best_answer: during the hot sunny day, the ball expand making it firm, and the air pressure inside the ball decreases.\n\nduring cold day, the ball contracts making the air inside the ball compressed, that is why the ball is hard.

question_title: what river runs though  licking county ohio? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Licking River\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia >>\n\nThe Licking River is formed at Newark in Licking County by the confluence of its north and south forks:\n\nThe North Fork Licking River, about 35 mi (55 km) long, rises in southwestern Morrow County and initially flows generally east-southeastwardly through Knox County, past Centerburg, into Licking County, where at Utica it turns southwardly and flows past St. Louisville. In Licking County the North Fork collects the Otter Fork Licking River, which rises in Knox County and flows past Hartford; the Lake Fork Licking River; and the Clear Fork Licking River. The Lake and Clear forks both flow for their entire lengths in Licking County. \n\nThe South Fork Licking River, about 30 mi (50 km) long, rises in southwestern Licking County and initially flows southeastwardly past Pataskala and Kirkersville and briefly enters Fairfield County, where it turns northeastwardly back into Licking County and flows past Heath.

question_title: Why do certain types of paper turn yellow faster than others? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Paper is made from wood, which is made up mainly of white cellulose. Wood also has a lot of a dark substance in it called lignin, which ends up in the paper, too, along with the cellulose. The exposure of lignin to air and sunlight is what turns paper yellow.\n\nLignin makes wood stiff and trees stand upright. You could say it acts as a glue to bind the cellulose fibers together. It is a polymer, a substance that is formed by the joining of simpler molecules into giant molecules that act differently than the smaller molecules did. Dr. Hou-Min Chang, a professor of wood and paper science at N.C. State University in Raleigh, N.C., compares lignin to the concrete used in buildings, with cellulose as the steel frame. Without lignin, Chang says, a tree could only grow to be about 6 feet tall. Lignin also helps protect the wood from pests and other damage.\n\nNewsprint, which must be produced as economically as possible, has more lignin in it than finer papers. At the mill, the wood that will be turned into newsprint is ground up, lignin and all.\n\nPaper manufacturers utilize the benefits of lignin in some types of paper, though. Brown kraft paper, the dark brown paper used in grocery store bags, and cardboard are stiff and sturdy because they have more lignin in them, and because those kinds of paper aren't treated with bleaching chemicals. It doesn't matter how dark they are because the printing on them is limited.\n\nTo make a fine white paper, the mill puts the wood through a chemical solvent process, which separates and discards the lignin. Pure cellulose is white, and the paper made from it will be white and will resist yellowing.\n\nLignin eventually turns paper yellow because of oxidation. That is, the lignin molecules, when exposed to oxygen in the air, begin to change and become less stable. The lignin will absorb more light, giving off a darker color. Chang says that if newsprint were kept completely out of sunlight and air, it would remain white. After only a few hours of sunlight and oxygen, however, it will start to change color.

question_title: What is the term used for an organism that can see well in both light and dark? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe such an animal the term low-light vision is used. Such as an owl. Most birds are sight-driven and have excellent vision. The owl has excellent day vision and excellent night vision because its pupils can dialte to allow moonlight or starlight sufficient lighting to see by. This is not to be confused with infravision which is totally different than low-light vision. That would allow the heat an animal gives off to be seen in the dark.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: resistance? [SEP] question_content: it is taught that resistance ,R increases with length and decreases with breadth...but with increase in breadth no: of particles in the material also increases.so how resistance decreases? [SEP] best_answer: First there is a correction to your statement.\n\nResistance increases with the length of the wire or conductor; but it decreases with the area of cross section of the wire or conductor. \n\nIt will give a wrong meaning if you use the word breadth instead of area of cross section.\n\nConsider a wire of length L and area of cross section A connected in a circuit. Let n be number of charges flowing through it under a given condition.\n\nNow connect a similar wire side be side with the previous one. (This is called parallel connection)\n\nAs before in the first wire there will be n number of charges flowing through it.\n\nWhat about the second wire. Since the condition is the same as the first one, in the second wire also there will be n number of charges flowing through it. \n\nThus if the area of cross section is doubled current is increased or resistance is decreased.\n\nIn a high way there is a bridge which is very narrow; the flow of vehicles will be less.\nIf the bridge is broadened the flow will increase.\n\nHowever the above is an analogy to make the concept some what to understand. But the charge in a wire is different from the vehicle flow.  \n\n\n\n.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how does fertilization happen? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The capacitated spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. In mammals, binding of the spermatozoon to the zona pellucida, an extracellular layer surrounding the oocyte, initiates the acrosome reaction. This process releases the enzyme hyaluronidase, which digests the matrix of hyaluronic acid in the vestments surrounding the oocyte. Fusion between the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes follows, allowing the entry of the sperm nucleus, mitochondria, centriole and flagellum into the oocyte. Once the ovum fuses with a single sperm cell, its cell membrane changes, preventing fusion with other sperm.\n\nThis process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote. When the zygote reaches the uterus and implants in the endometrium, the female is said to be pregnant.\n\nIf fertilisation takes place, the sperm usually meet the ovum in the fallopian tube, requiring the sperm cells to swim from the upper vagina through the cervix and across the length of the uterus before reaching the fallopian tube—a considerable distance compared to the size of the sperm cell.\n\n\nFertilization in plants\n\nAfter the pistil is pollinated, the pollen grain germinates in a response to a sugary fluid secreted by the mature stigma. From each pollen grain, a pollen tube grows out attempting to travel into the ovary by creating a path. The vegetative and generative nuclei of the pollen grain pass into its respective pollen tube. The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative nucleus. Enzymes are secreted to digest the tissue of the stigma a style as the polen tube grows. The pollen tube does not directly reach the ovary in a straight line. It travels near the skin of the style and curls to the bottom of the ovary, then near the receptacle, it breaks through the ovule through the microphyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and reaches the ovum to fertilise it. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs. After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and becomes a fruit.\n\nWith multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule. The process is easy to visualise if one looks at maize silk, which is the female flower of corn. Pollen from the tassel (the male flower) falls on the sticky external portion of the silk, and then pollen tubes grow down the silk to the attached ovule. The dried silk remains inside the husk of the ear as the seeds mature; if one carefully removes the husk, the floral structures may be shown. The development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with watermelon, about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is the world really running out of oil? [SEP] question_content: I understand what it does as far as pollution etc. but this is a huge world. Aren't there places that can't be harmed where there is oil to be gotten? [SEP] best_answer: Ok, maybe I would be a better person to ask this question since I actually work in the industry finding the stuff. Seems to me some people have made up they're own minds without much knowledge of the industry.\n\nAs one guy has pointed out, yes as it takes millions of years to from and the amount we have used thus far is greater than that being made naturally. \n\nHowever, what people fail to realise is that its the larger discoveries which for the past decade has been in decine due to the price of oil. As such, oil companies were reluctant to spend money in exploration because of the decreased profit they would make. Since Bush decided to invade Iraq, the oil price shot up and now exploration is booming. More discoveries are being made, and production is up.\n\nAlso as you have mentioned there are places which have yet to be discovered. I recently was working for a company which did an exploration well which they had been planning for 20 years! Long time planning if you ask me, but the reason it took so long was because the techonolgy avaliable was not around at the time to explore it. We can only explore within the capabilities of current techonolgy. Not only that there are vast areas of the world that have yet to even be siesmically survey'ed, for example the Pacific Ocean, big huge expanse of water, how long do you think it would take to map the sub surface geology?\n\nAs for your third part of your question, there is such a thing as extended reach drilling, where (as the name suggests) they drill long sections and could quite easily tap potential reservoirs without damaging sensitive environments. Such drilling goes on in the UK.\n\nAll in all no the oil is not running out, these next few years are going to see and peak in the production of oil since hte industry started.\n\nP.S. Removing the oil from the ground doesnt in any way shape or form cause volcanoes as the guy above me suggested, that is mearly ill' education!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: where can I find low-cost, compact, force transducers for simple laboratory experiment? [SEP] question_content: The transducers are needed for a high-school-level laboratory set-up/experiment.  I need 40 such transducers.  The required frequency response is very low: DC-5Hz.  The transducers need to be simple to operate. [SEP] best_answer: Various springs (flat or helical) deflect linearly with load and resistance of certain wires (nichrome, etc.) varies linearly with length.  If your experiment allows or expects large deflections you may be able to combine the spring/resistors into a circuit that calibrates force/deflection/resistance-reading suitable for measurement on an ohmmeter or perhaps a strip chart recorder.  Good luck.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is FIRE alive?...CLICK HERE for a very convincing argument.? [SEP] question_content: I seem to recall 3 requirements from Biology class to determine if something is 'alive.'\n\n(1)It breathes....fires can even shatter windows trying to get more oxygen.\n\n(2)It moves...fires clearly can consume entire forests by moving from tree to tree.\n\n(3)it reproduces...fires start with only a spark and seemingly have no limit to their size. [SEP] best_answer: No fire itself is not alive (it has no DNA/RNA, it does not perform metabolism, it does not reproduce via mitosis or meiosis, and it is not self sustaining), but fire is essential to life, and without the human abilty to contain and create fire - life as we know it would be quite different.

VERY low in fact.  Has anyone tried stratagene?  By the way, im using tRNA from liver tissue of guinea fowl. [SEP] best_answer: Yes I have worked with RNA before. The main difficulty with all of the procedures is making sure you have gotten rid of the RNAses. They are very tough and stable, so you have to make sure everything has RNAse inhibitors (DEPC). I dont know enought about guinea fowl to know if they use similar polyA tails that humans, etc do. If not, the oligo-dT resin wouldnt have much to bind to. I dont know what your goal is but you could consider a PCR strategy to amplify what you are looking for. If you are looking for some tissue expression, you could look into buying premade mRNA from a company, which we used successfully before. hope that helps!	Science & Mathematics

(I think this has something to do with the number of elements in G of a prime order being of the form m(p-1) where m>=0)\n\n\n\nHi guys,  am hoping someone can help me out with these questions for my honours algebra course (exam in 3 weeks!!!) I do have a vague answer sheet for them but I was hoping someone could explain them to me a bit better. Thanks very much. [SEP] best_answer: Both are results of the CAUCHY THEOREM which says that for any prime p and finite group G, if p||G|, then G contains an element of order p.  Now note that for any element a in any group G, {a^j| j is an integer} is ALWAYS a subgroup of G because for any element a^j, its inverse a^(-j) is in this subgroup, it contains the identity element (a^0), it's closed because a^ia^j = a^(i+j) and the integers are closed, and it inherits its associativity from G.  In this case, we have an element a of order p so that a^p = 1 and hence for all integers j, a^j = a^t for some nonnegative t < p.  This is because any integer j can be expressed as mp+r for some integer m and 0 <= r < p so that a^j = a^(mp+r) = a^(mp)a^r = (a^p)^m*a^r = 1^m*a^r = a^r.  Therefore this subgroup will contain the elements, 1,a,a^2,...,a^(p-1) and hence p elements as desired.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: The first year on the AL featured the Chicago White Sox, Boston Americans, Milwaukee Brewers, Cleveland Blues, Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators, Philadelphia A's, and Detroit Tigers.\n\nThe Orioles would move to New York and become the Yankees, while the others are still around in one form or another.\n\nThe original NL teams (1876) were the Chicago White Stockings (who became the Cubs), Hartford Dark Blues (gone), St. Louis Brown Stockings (gone), Boston Red Caps (now the Atlanta Braves), Louisville Grays (gone), NY Mutuals (gone), Philadelphia A's (gone, not the same A's as today), and the Cincinnati Reds, who are not the same as today's Reds franchise, which started as an American Association team in 1882.

Could Jones out box Moorer or would Moorer catch Jones like Tarver did and end it. Remember now, we're talking about the pound for pound best Roy before he fought Tarver.

Great player, funny guy, massive personality, and yet possibly the least likely England manager I can think of.  I'd prefer most people in that role.

Its this skewed state that directly affects his intelligence as it is perceived by the masses. I've seen interviews where Mike quotes Ernest Hemingway, then change the channel and Mike is threatening to "eat someones kids". \n\nSo, like the majority of answers in YA the end result is based on opinion.

I've tried everything I know and some of them still lack the power and speed. Any help??? [SEP] best_answer: A good way to get younger kids to do things is to show them by example. Take them to a college softball game or a good high school game. Tell them to watch the hitters. They will start to mimic the players. Also a good drill to do is to hit volleyballs or basketballs. This forces them to power through the ball. Then when they hit the softball it seems easy. It helps if you deflate the balls a little bit.	Sports

question_title: How much do soccer coaches earn at the UNiversity,High school and Elementary in the U.S.? [SEP] question_content: I'd like to know more about soccer coaches earnings? [SEP] best_answer: University coaches can make a range of salaries, but I would say that division 1 coaches can make at least 50,000.  In cases like UNC's Women's program (with such a winning tradition), I'd say that the number is even higher.  It depends on where in the US you're talking about as well, as the coasts probably pay more. \n\nAs a high school coach, I can tell you that it ranges from about 2000 to 3000 per season (varsity soccer coach).\n\nElementary coaches, which there are few of, because usually elementary schools don't have teams, are probably about the same as high school coaches, or might make a little less.\n\nThe coaches that make money at coaching youth soccer are the club coaches.  They are more specialized, can coach several age groups, and can charge anywhere from 200-2000 per kid per month.  Parents are paying for prestige, but mostly for results (winning teams, and quality players).	Sports
question_title: Who scored the winning goal for England against Germany in the 1966 world cup? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Geoff Hurst - From the Wikipedia entry on the subject.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_World_Cup_1966\n\n"After 12 minutes Helmut Haller had put West Germany ahead, but the score was levelled by Geoff Hurst four minutes later.\n...\nWith the score level at 2-2 at the end of 90 minutes, the game went to extra time. In the 98th minute Hurst found himself on the score sheet again; his shot hit the crossbar, bounced down onto the goal line, and then back into play and was controversially deemed to have crossed the line by the linesman and referee. In the last minute, it was Hurst again to easily sprint through the (then almost empty) German half and net his third, just as the gathered crowd invaded the pitch to celebrate with the team, thus cementing the victory for England. This made Geoff Hurst the only player ever to have scored three times in a World Cup Final."	Sports

Took over 10 minutes and still hadn't made up their minds.\nDhoni had been about to walk off with his batting partner since Dravid had declared  with Dhoni's "dismissal". \nSo Lara told Dhoni it was up to him if he was going to walk or not.\nIt looked like play was about to resume when Lara took the ball from the Pakistani umpire and was giving Mohammed instructions.\nThe umpires were still discussing what to do.\nDravid declared because it looked as if the umpires would stand there the entire day deciding on what to do.\nLater, in the dressing room Dhoni accepted Ganga's word and took his dismissal.\n\nThat was one of the stupidest thigs I've ever seen!!!!!!\nIt was utter crap!

First of all, don't blame me. I didn't create truth, and if what I happen to think is wrong, what's it to you? Is it so far fetched to say that there is a truth out there, and it's bigger than us (humans)? Where do people get the idea that they can come up with something, and the fact that they said so makes it truth? Again, there is truth and there are lies.  What is difficult to understand about that? [SEP] best_answer: The statement that the only absolute truth is that there is no absolute truth isn't a paradox- it's a load of crap.  It conflicts because it's wrong.  I have a tendency to fall back on pedophilia when trying to prove that there MUST be moral absolutes (and that they MUST come from something other than humans if they're absolutes).  If you're willing to say that pedophilia is a-okay as long as the pedophile thinks it's okay, then I can't reason with you.  If, however, you admit that pedophilia is wrong, then you're admitting to a moral absolute.  \n\nI'm with you, nice girl.  You can't create truth.  You can only observe it or choose to turn away from it.  There's no middle ground.	Society & Culture

question_title: What is the history of Fashnaught day? [SEP] question_content: In Pennsylvania this is a big day for the dutch, german culture does anyone know how it got started and what it means? [SEP] best_answer: Fashnaught is a variation of the German "Faschnacht" or "Fastnacht" (literally, "fast night;" conceptually, "night before fasting").  For Catholics and some other Christian denominations its a celebration that precedes Lent, which is, of course, traditionally the period of fasting and moderation that precedes Easter.  Historically, those who observe Lent have had celebrations to be able to enjoy some of the things they liked one last time before giving them up for 40 days.  Shrove Tuesday, Fasching, Faschnachts Day, Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday, and Carnival are some examples of essentially the same celebration.  The German variant of this celebration has been traced back to at least the 13th century.  I've provided you with two links that briefly refer to the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) tradition.

It was the religious people of his day who had him crucified , and he called them whitewashed tombs, and a brood of vipers .\n\nThe Assembly of God is probably the closest to what Jesus wanted for us to be , but we are not perfect by far .

question_title: What's the best way to hide a dead body? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering. What's the best way? Not anything that will get someone caught. Just asking. [SEP] best_answer: Don't use lime. A big mistake. It is monitored by law enforcement agencies and after burying the body, after a long period of time, the lime can actually end up preserving the body.\n \nBurial is generally the worst way to go. Decomposition is very slow and soil erosion is something to worry about. Travel the body far away from where you live. Something like a large lake or river is good. The deeper and quicker-moving water is better. Something also needs to weight down the victim. Strap some kind of weight to the body using simple duct tape. Make sure you tape it to the mid-section of the body and not the limbs or head as erosion will eventually result in the loss of the limbs.\n\nThe water life, aquatic bacteria, and constantly moving water will provide the quickest and best for removing all the evidence. Don't be stupid and using trash bags or something to contain the body as this only preserves the body more.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Someone told me that somewhere in Alabama, interracial marriages is against the law.\n\nI think that this is terrible!\nIs this a little known law that was'nt amended or is it hearsay?

Alabama was the last of the 16 states to overturn such laws, which they did in 2000.	Society & Culture

question_title: I am a Christian...? [SEP] question_content: I am a Christian I asked Jesus into my heart when I was 7. Why is it that we have so many people lost (spiritual term) and instead of trying to teach them more a/b the ways of our Lord when we see their either difference in opinion or even small "mindedness" we put them down and tell them they are definatley going to hell. When Jesus would not have done that. He would have taken the time to teach them his good hearted and loving ways. Therefore when the Christians that beat their bibles and demean others they are just making themselves look like hypocrites. Thats the reason why people in our society today call ALL Christians hypocrites. B/c those few that are criticizing others, THEY INDEED are the small minded people! Honestly they are lessening the people that will enter the gates of heaven! Why do that to God's kingdom? [SEP] best_answer: Because the flesh is weak .... People get all hot and bothered and high and mighty they forget what it is to be humble before the Lord in worship and haveing a meek and peaceful heart.  There is a time to stand up and shout (for Christ himself did Yell and holler when the time came ( when he stormed the temple and the money changers))  and there is a time to be meek.  But it is ALWAYS time to respond in Love....  sometime love needs to put it's foot down in someones face... and sometime it needs to Hold on tight to the person ... and sometimes it's to let them go and pray.... \n\nWe need to pray for all our brothers and sisters to spend more time at the feet of their savior in prayer and worship... and pray they would be driven to show him to the world...\n\nMay God bless you lil sis... the Lord guide you and give you peace	Society & Culture
question_title: Who is easier to get rid out of house, a Mormon or Jelovah Witness ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Jehovah's witnesses. Mormons tend to challenge you on your beliefs. In my past experiences, when a Jehovah's witness came to my door, if I told them I was catholic (which I'm not) they would just say "ok" and leave. Mormons, on the other hand, wanted to "compare notes!!" I actually made friends with 4 mormon missionaries, and they really could have gotten into trouble if their superiors knew what they were doing! See, when mormons are going door to door, they aren't allowed to have radios, t.v.'s, or anything else that distracts them from their studies. (this was told to me by these guys.) Well, to make a long story short, they used to come to my house so they could sing karaoke with my girls and me. I have a system set up for home use as well as 2 others that I use for business. We had a good time. :)	Society & Culture

question_title: Man! I want her!? [SEP] question_content: There is this girl that lives down the hall from me.  She's beautiful.  I really want to get to know her.  I really want her.  The thing is, the only time I see her is in passing.  I've never even had a conversation with her.  Everytime I do see her, she's on the way to something, or I'm on my way to something. I don't even know if she's into girls, but I think she is.  Everytime I see her, I try to make eye contact, but she seems like she's nervous and won't look at me.  I could be reading, but the way she acts around me is like when you have a crush on someone, and are nervous about being around them.  I would throw her up against a wall, but I think that may be a little too forward.  What I'm looking for is a way to get close to her.  I need to get to know her, talk to her, but I can't.  Tonight, I'm kicking myself because I was going to go to a gala tonight, but decided not to, so later, I see that she's going.  I could punch a hole in a wall! Someone help me. PLEASE! [SEP] best_answer: the fact dat u not goin to the gala might not be such a bad thing cuz 2morrow wen u see her comming your way then u get to have a reason to stop her by simply sayin hi..how are u..how waz the gala since i didnt go?..then she will tell u about her experience then u tell her about yours and dat how u start to get to kno her and next time you guys could go togeter and just show her a good time and wat u all about!..the key is to just go with the flow dont force any topic into the conversation. i hope it works out!!

question_title: Muslim Prayer? [SEP] question_content: When Muslims pray 5 times a day, what do they pray??  A christian will pray for food, clothing, a job, health problems, money problems, friends, or just to talk to his Father and be happy communing with him.  \nWhen Muslims pray what do they do?? [SEP] best_answer: we pray for what you've listed and also for going to paradise, for god go forgive us, for non-believers to see the truth, to be protected from hell fire..but, the 5 prayer we do is not an exact translation it is called salat and not the exact English meaning for prayers. It is to submit your self to god to show him obedience and so on.\n\nhere this may help:\nSalah (Prayer) \n\nPrayer (Salah), in the sense of worship, is the second pillar of Islam. Prayer is obligatory and must be performed five times a day. These five times are dawn (Fajr), immediately after noon (Dhuhr), mid-afternoon ('Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and early night (Isha'). Ritual cleanliness and ablution are required before prayer, as are clean clothes and location, and the removal of shoes. One may pray individually or communally, at home, outside, virtually in any clean place, as well as in a mosque, though the latter is preferred. Special is the Friday noon prayer, called Jum'ah. It too, is obligatory and is to be done in a mosque, in congregation. It is accompanied by a sermon (Khutbah), and it replaces the normal Dhuhr prayer. \n\nThere is no hierarchical clerical authority in Islam, no priests or ministers. Prayers are led by any learned person who knows the Qur'an and is chosen by the congregation. He (or she, if the congregation is all women) is called the imam. There is also no minimum number of congregates required to hold communal prayers. Prayer consists of verses from the Qur'an and other prayers, accompanied by various bodily postures - standing, bowing, prostrating and sitting. They are said in Arabic, the language of the revelation, though personal supplications (Du'ah) can be offered in one's own language. Worshippers face the Qiblah, the direction of the Ka'bah in the city of Makkah. \n\nThe significance of prayer lies in one's maintaining a continuous link to God five times a day, which helps the worshipper avoid misdeeds if he/she performs the prayers sincerely. In addition it promotes discipline, God-consciousness and placing one's trust in Allah alone, and the importance of striving for the Hereafter. When performed in congregation it also provides a strong sense of community, equality and brotherhood/sisterhood.	Society & Culture
question_title: christians: if you were given proof somehow that god doesn't exist, would you still try to be a moral person? [SEP] question_content: ok, time for a serious question from me. i'm not trying to be inflammitory or rude, so keep an open mind and think before you respond. here goes: if it was somehow proven to you that, after you have died, there is no reward or punishment given for your deeds in life, would you still try to live your life rightously and ethically? is your motivation to be a good person simply the fear of hell? if not, can you accept that a person who is an athiest or otherwise can be a good person anyway? would your god and his son welcome that person into heaven, even though they don't go to church or use conventional prayer methods? [SEP] best_answer: I live the way I live because I have found that it's the best way to live.  I find that based on my experience, living the way God wants me to is the best way to live, which if He doesn't exist, is a rather odd coincidence...	Society & Culture

question_title: Have you seen "Davinci code" film? any comment about the film? [SEP] question_content: There are some facts that is revealed in this film, is it true? which is true, and which is false? [SEP] best_answer: I just saw the film.\n\nThe part about how Christianity took pagan beliefs and mixed them in is correct. The fact that Constantine changed the religion (at least to a degree) is correct.  In fact when he ruled that in order to hold government office you had to be a Christian he managed to turn a bunch of pagans into Christians (in name only) over night.  Their underlying pagan beliefs remained the same, they just changed their title.\n\nThe part about the museum having bathroom windows that can be opened is absolutely false. Nor does the museum have bar soap that you can stick a GPS tracer into, they have liquid soap in the bathrooms.\n\nThe Priory has been pretty much determined to be a fraud. (Discovery Channel ran a series of shows which demonstrated this.) Of course, the paranoid will say that the "fraud" is just a cover story and it is exactly what the Priory wants you to think so that they stay secret.  \n\nThe idea that the "royal bloodline" filters down to one and only one woman in Europe seems pretty unbelievable. The Merovingians had many kids, there would have to be several thousand Merovingians by this point in history.\n\nThe idea that Jesus and Magdelene were married, well, not much proof one way or the other. Even if they were, it is that thing about rising from the dead that still sets things apart.\n\nOne idea that I don't think most people have considered is the possibility that the entire DaVinci Code movie and book might just be designed as a meme (brain virus as it were). Designed to "inject" the concept of this bloodline into the populace. Then, when the time is ripe, "they" will unveil a person who is supposedly the descendant in question whom "they" want to setup as a One World Leader.\n\nFrankly I think there is more "fact" in "The Norman Rockwell Code".

I switched on my TV also and heard the horrifying news that a mother in Ohio has been arrested for cooking her infant in the microwave.  It has made me physically sick. Some people are worse than animals.  Animals would never do something as bad as that.  Do you feel that you must turn the TV off and throw away your newspapers sometimes?  Does it all get to be too much for you?  Maybe I'm weak but, sometimes I can't take it for a while. [SEP] best_answer: First of all, there are animals/insects that eat their young.  Secondly, yes I am horrified and wonder what had become of the human race.  It appears we (humans) have all lost our common sense, our compassion, our hearts.  Something is very wrong with people today and I'm not sure how it happened.  \n\nPeople like to blame video games and rap music (neither of which I am fond of), but I'm not sure they are the problem.  I do know that people want everything instantly (instant coffee, microwaves, internet, emails) and have no patience.  Maybe because no one is patient?  People have become more rude and obnoxious.

question_title: Christians: If Jesus died for our sins, why do we still have to go to hell because of it? [SEP] question_content: If Jesus died for our sins, why do we have to go to hell because of it? For Atheists: pretend God's real, okay? [SEP] best_answer: Nobody knows what happens to us when we die, or this concept of hell or heaven. Well by catholic mythology, i think as long as you live a good life, christian or not, youll go to heaven, or spend a few years in purgatory at the most, because comon, then over half of the world would be going to hell. Heaven would be like some deluxe snob club where only a few members were allowed in.\n\nBut realistically our concept of heaven and hell has grown out of control, its turned into a huge bribe, but hey i guess it works a lot of the time. The jews (the religion christianty evoloved out of) didnt have a strict conept of heaven or hell, they knew to live life good, and that god would punish them in life for unfaithfulness and sometimes the punishment would carry over to those that were close to them. They had some slight concept of bliss and punishment in the afterlife but it didnt consume all the time and thought as it does in christianity. Actually it sounds like it was tampered with somewhat by rulers and writers.\n\nI dont think jesus wants us to suffer, if anything i think hed give us a redo, in a soemwhat reincarntional concept., then again if jesus did exist and was god's son.\n\ndont worry about it so much and just try to live a good life by the golden rule.\n\ndont take naything form the bible literally, most of its to be taken out of context into your own consideration and recieve a message and apply it to your own life.

question_title: If we are suppose to love our brothers and sisters? [SEP] question_content: Then why do we hurt eachother and others all the time? [SEP] best_answer: Lack of love for God, for if you truly love God with your whole heart, mind and strength he gives you the power to love others.\nThat is why it is the first commandment.\nThe First Commandment is the most basic requirement for beginning to understand God’s truth and to fulfill our ultimate purpose. All humanity is warned to put God first, and to avoid false gods. The Being who issued that first and great commandment rephrased it in Matthew 22:37.\n\nNotice: “Jesus said unto him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment.” In this New Testament passage, Christ was essentially quoting words that He inspired in Deuteronomy 4:5.	Society & Culture

B likes C, but C doesn't like her back. D likes B, and here's where the problem is- E likes me. It is REALLY creepy because after I told her I was straight, she kinda flipped out and now she's  harassing me and stroking my body and everything and making me feel uncomfortable. I need help with this- I also need help because after C said she didn't like B back, B has been really depressed and I feel awful and don't know what to do...Thanks so much. [SEP] best_answer: There has to be a mutual agreement among friends. I have lots of strait friends some do attract me, however there is that mutual agreement that I'm bi and there strait so i would never act on those feelings out of respect. If a mutual agreement has not been established you and your friends need to do that in a nice way without hurting each other. Set boundaries. True friends will respect each others feelings. The bi girls should understand this more that any one.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what's the point in having an "OPEN" relationship? [SEP] question_content: i dunno about u, but it seem ironic to be in a COMMITMENT and not have yourself COMMITED to the person u love. [SEP] best_answer: open relationship isnt exactly a relationship of the caliber youa re describing. start with what a relationship is - you to your friend, a teacher, your pet. Everything you come in contact with has some sort of relationship to you, same as the partner you are in an open relationship with. In this situation, one member does not want to hold commitment to anyone, till they are sure they will be with that person for quite a while. go and have fun, and stop worrying about love so much, its nice but it will always happen again, if you put yourself out there.

question_title: How do ask girls out? [SEP] question_content: I am so shy, i can talk over the internet to them, but not face to face. help me out.

question_title: at a party.? [SEP] question_content: it was my besties 18th the other night and everyone there was really really drunk when me and my boy turned up. i walked out the back and one of her mates sam started cracking onto me massively even though h knows i have a boyfriend. my boyfriend daniel went rank and completely went off at him. i told him it was nothing... is he over reacting or just being protective??? [SEP] best_answer: I'd have to say he's being protective in this case. If everyone happened to be really drunk as you said and you and your BF were not. He was doing the only thing he knew how to prevent a situation from escalating into something potentially dangerous to you. Just give him a hug and a kiss and tell him thank you for looking out for you. I could only say he was over reacting if Sam were sober and joking around with you and your BF heard the conversation and went off even after knowing Sam was just jesting then it would be over reaction on the BF's part.

question_title: what makes a man who is married and who flirts A LOT with me do it? is his marriage unhappy you think? [SEP] question_content: im just curious to know why a man who is married with kids would flirt to the extent that he does with me? he is married, my doctor, and has kids. the type of flirting is unethical i already know that... but i just wonder why someone that knows that it's wrong professionally and morally would put himself out there on the line the way he does. what do u think? would you say that he is going through a mid life crisis? he is like 50 and his wife is the same. [SEP] best_answer: You hit the nail on the head with "mid-life crisis". He needs validation that his manhood and virility are still intact. This is however, a breach of his professional ethics. His marriage may not be unhappy ... just stale. It happens in the very best of marriages.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do I cope with this Father's Day? [SEP] question_content: I recently lost my dad whom I was very close to! It's been very hard for my mom, brother and I. Mama and brother are coming to Louisiana to visit this weekend so that we can be together on Father's Day since it will be difficult for us. We believe in God and that's the only way we've survived this. Therefore; I thought it would be good to just celebrate daddy and our Father in Heaven. For those of you who may have lost your dad, how do you handle Father's Day? Thanks for your advice. [SEP] best_answer: The first year after you lose a parent is the hardest ~ the first birthdays, holidays, and other special times you have as a family without them there to share it with you.  We still have our dad, but our mom passed away about 10 years ago.  One of the things we do as a family on Mother's Day to remember our mom is have breakfast together.  We make Mom's favorite breakfast (blueberry coffee cake and hot tea) and talk about our special memories of her.  We look at pictures and laugh and cry ~ it's actually a really great time!  I love your idea of celebrating your father and our Father in Heaven together.  It's a very appropriate way to remember that both of them are watching over you.  Best wishes to you and your family.

I used to always get on her case because of this but she wouldn't budge. Now that she is pregnant I have tasted her breast milk and I don't blame her one bit.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Who are Positive People and how can I get them into my life? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Positive people are those who are always optimistic about life. They see the glass as half full versus half empty. Positive people generally have a lot of karma and believe in the philosophy that you get what you give (or "what goes around comes around"). They are always nice to others, never a backstabber, and very pleasant to be around.\n\nTo surround yourself with positive people, you must first become one yourself. This begins with mastering the art of positive thinking. Positive thinking begins with looking at life differently.\n\nIn the beginning stages of becoming a positive thinker, it takes a lot of effort that will soon become habit. Whenever you catch yourself thinking a negative thought ("I can't stand that person"), change it to a positive thought ("This person has some good traits and because I don't know his/her life situation, I won't judge him/her.")\n\nStart to "take time to smell the flowers". Admire the beauty of your surroundings. Start to do good things for others. If you have some extra money, when you go through a drive-through then pay for the bill of the person behind you! Practice doing positive and fulfilling things. Remove yourself from negative influences and vow to always be positive.\n\nThe good news is that as you become more positive then other positive people will be attracted to you! You will be able to more easily identify positive people (once you are one) and start doing nice things for them in order to form a friendship and improve the positive surroundings in your life.\n\nBest of success to you!

[SEP] question_content: We have been together for 2 years,he left a previous relationship to be with me.The thing is,he and the ex never really parted ways.He's a great guy but he just had issues but I fell in love and stayed anyway.Long story short,she ended up pregnant,lost the baby in her 8th month,had a funeral,but now she's using it against him as if the baby was still alive.I know he loves me and he made a mistake,he even proposed to me since then.She's playing on his sympathy,should I give up?What to do?!?! [SEP] best_answer: Not really much you can do. It's up to him to grow up and decide who is best for him.

[SEP] best_answer: First of all, get some counseling to help you deal with your problems. Why did he have to know right then? Why couldn't he respect the fact that you didn't want to talk about it? You should have the right not to talk about what you don't want to. If he hasn't contacted you again because you wouldn't talk about this, does he really care about you? I'm just saying this because what he did was NOT YOUR FAULT! Perhaps you could have asked to talk about it later, but that didn't happen.\n\nLet's say you find him and still want to apologize...you could simply say, "I'm sorry for hurting your feelings by not talking to you about the problem. I was uncomfortable at the time. I needed some space. I am ready to talk about it now." (Assuming you actually do want to talk about it.) Tell him that sometimes you need time to think. If he can't respect that you deserve better!\n\nAnd, again, get some help from a doctor if you feel like hurting yourself again, please!	Family & Relationships

Gender unspecified.  All you can do is continue to be a friend, and let the situation develop.  You can't force anything, as the assumption would be that you wish to get in between them.  Hang out together, maybe make it a point to discuss various different forms of sexuality, bring up the subject of triangles.  No pressure, but find out where each of them stands on the subject.  In the process, they may get the hint.	Family & Relationships
question_title: was this girl a virgin ( R-Rated Details)? [SEP] question_content: I had sex with ex-gf, and she claimed to be a virgin. I asked her if she was ready and she said no, so i jokingly said well how bout anal and she said ok she wanted to try it. Afterwards we slept in the morning i we talked about it and i said well are you ready for vaginal and she said yes.  I have my  doubts she was a virgin  butnever discussed them with her.\n\n She didnt bleed it was tight and she did seem to be in pain for the first couple minutes but after that it was just like any normal girl. She liked it hard and deep. and showed some exsperinece when she was ontop. was eager for different posistions. She came several times, and from then on out for the rest of the relationship sex was a regular thing.  I just always felt like she lied to me. I mean i never used a rubber bc she was on birth control and she would offer take them infront of me so  i wouldnt worry. only came in here a few times.\n\nAll in all you think she was a Virgin. [SEP] best_answer: Personally i don't think she was a vrigin .The reason why is not because she did not bleed coz a lot of girls can losse that in other ways like too much excersice apart from that if she has been mastubating.you see it's her reaction during and after sex that is not rection i will be expecting from a vrigin ,except she has been watching a lot of porn.Anyways just take care that is in the past just look forward ok.it's the present and future that matters not the past, maybe she was just trying to impresses you.

What are some of the ways that I can tell if she's interested in me? I mean I'm worried because the first date ended in a hand shake, and then of course the baby sitter cancelled the following weekend [SEP] best_answer: See if the next date goes as plans.\nIf the sitter is a no show and she cancels, then I would say she is not sure how to tell you she is not interested.\nDon't be offended by the hand shake she might just be a lil nervous, so if you should go out on the second date, you get close to her when you walk her to the door, lean into her body just a tad if she moves towards you a lil that is your signal go for the kiss.\nJust be happy she is not easy, some women like to play hard to get just to see if your really interested in her.  I know women can and are a bit confussing :)	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: The reason you can't find them is that bachelor parties traditionally have not involved written invitations. If you really want to do them, you'll probably have to do them yourself.... find a picture you think is suitable, and get some "do it yourself" invitations from Staples or a craft store and print the invitations at home.

I am unsure of this Taxco place in Mexico, but I do know there are a few shady dealings coming from there. Mexican silver is not always on the mark as is sterling silver. Try places like Rio Grande of Albuquerque, also there is a place that sells very cheaply (you get what you pay for) I think it is Thunderbird something out of New Mexico. Not all there things are bad some are great, it really depends on what you are looking for.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Yes, you can work, but your school schedule + work schedule has to be under a certain number of hours ( I think it's 44 hours in MI).  You might be able to get a job bussing tables, washing dishes, working on a farm, paper routes, and then there's always free enterprise like yardwork, weeding gardens, walking dogs, babysitting, etc. \nI'm happy to see young people asking for jobs, instead of asking for $$$ from mom & dad.

The profit is $0.05. Take $0.05 and divide it over $1.00. You would get 0.05. That's a 5% return. \nHope this answers your question!	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: First you want to register the business then get bonded and insured. This is a good starting point and are a plus when your pitching to a potential customer. It says "we are safe to let into your home and you will be compensated if something gets broken".  As far as charges go call some of the local cleaning companies and pose as a potential client and get their rates. Then go below them at least at first. Once you get a customer or two and if you do a good job  word should spread. Word of mouth is very vital as far as gaining new clients. Good Luck!	Business & Finance

"Admitted" carriers are licensed to do business in your state - and subject to the rules and regulations, and SUPERVISION, of your state insurance department.  So if you have any problems, complaints, etc, you can write to the insurance department, and they will intervene.  Their policy forms have also been approved (or are on file) with the same insurance department. \n\nPolicies issued through non-admitted companies are subject to a state tax and stamping fee, and frequently an inspection/audit fee, as well.  \n\nHOWEVER.  Nonadmitted companies have more flexibility, and are more willing to be "creative" in their underwriting.   They will frequently write higher risk accounts, such as a demolition contractor or lead paint abatement company.  \n\nIf you're buying insurance, and considering a nonadmitted carrier, be very careful to check www.ambest.com for the financial rating - you do NOT want to buy insurance from a company that is rated lower than A-, or smaller than a V.  \n\nThere are some very, very good non-admitted companies out there - Scottsdale comes immediately to mind.  So don't write them off just because they aren't admitted - you really need to compare costs and coverages as well.	Business & Finance

question_title: Can a server be held responsible for guest walkouts? [SEP] question_content: I'm a server in Arizona, and this weekend I had a two guests walk out on a $30 bill.  They were very nice older ladies, so I don't think it was intentional.  The owner told me that I am responsible for the bill, but people have told me that it is illegal for him to do that, and also uncommon in the restaurant industry.  Does anyone know for sure? [SEP] best_answer: I have worked in restaurants and bars since 1975 and yes, servers are responsible for walk-outs.  The attitude of the establishment is that once you have rung in the order, you just purchased it and therefore must collect it from the customer.  I think it is totally unfair but I have never seen an establishment that takes responsibility. Keep a close eye on your tables, I have had to chase people outside on many occasions.  I think that if the server has to pay it, it should be based on the ACTUAL cost of the product not the consumer cost...but they don't seem to see it that way.  I hope this helps you.

This name, which comes from Ezekiel 3:15, means tell — an ancient mound formed when a town is built on its own debris for thousands of years — of spring.

question_title: Does your gov't release immigrant convicted murderers, rapists and sex offenders back into your communities. [SEP] question_content: I live in good old England where our government has let a load of immigrant murderers and rapists loose on our streets (probably to reoffend) without once considering deportation to the sewers that they came from. I know Bush has got a marshmellow for a brain but even he isn't that stupid is he?? [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately yes, he is that stupid. Recently in Boston, MA we have a CONVICTED sex offender (raped school aged children) released for a weekend pass, go to FLORIDA, molested some other kids, came back to BOSTON and was fitted with a homing device so that they could finally track him while he lives in a house somewhere in my state. There are plenty of cases where they have constantly ignored the signs of a mentally ill person and only take action when they finally KILL someone but release them again when they feel they have paid their debts to society and they believe there is a chance that they will not re-offend. \n\nThanks alot for letting it be realized that this doesn't only happen in the U.S. I was starting to feel like maybe there is a good reason to hate this country.

question_title: at what point will human population overwhelm the earths ability to sustain it.when will it happen? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: anyone who thinks that the world is overproducing food is just plain not paying attention. The current practices of food production in the world give us (or any living thing) about 40-80 more years of soil left for which to grow food in. If the practices of today's farmers are authenticated, then we can start "turning the clock back." To answer your question, the point was about 1940 when we overtook the earth's ability to provide for us. (think baby boomers). If we do things right, we can provide a healthy life for a pop'n of over 8 billion. Right now,only about 750 million people get adequately clean food and water.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: The Government has created a portal to help individuals who need benefits because of life events. Visit http://www.govbenefits.gov\n\nUse the drop down button\nDO YOU NEED BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A LIFE EVENT?\nChoose the life situation best applicable to you and then see if you qualify for the available government assistance.\n\nForget grant money - there's hardly any money for individuals. You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: I heard someone died and was put on ice to keep while a grave was dug and a coffin made.And that the body was not embalmed but put in a pine box without a secure lid, (possibly in a vault that also was not sealed.)  Iam not sure if it truely happened or if I is just a hoax of some kind.  So is or was it legal to do?  I don't think it is. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know about putting a body on ice. But, it is not required that bodies be embalmed if they are buried within a certain amount of time, and if they are not taken across state lines. There is no requirement for a sealed vault (or, actually, any vault in a private cemetary; vaults really only exist to keep the weight of the soil from collapsing the coffin). There is no requirement for a sealed coffin for immediate burial; seals really don't serve any purpose except to make the deceased's family members feel better. When you're dead you decompose whether in a sealed or unsealed coffin.	Politics & Government

The position of Speaker is established in the U.S. Constitution and is the most senior officer of the House of Representatives (and the third most senior official in the entire federal government.) Institutionally, the Speaker holds broad-ranging powers and presides over debate in the House, makes rulings on points of order, has priority right of recognition on the floor, and sets the agenda by deciding what and when legislation comes before the House. In addition, the Speaker appoints task forces and commissions and oversees the management of support functions to the House. Finally, by modern practice, the Speaker serves as the primary spokesperson for his congressional party.\nSee also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\nHouse Majority Leader.

question_title: Was Bill Clinton a satisfactory president? [SEP] question_content: I'm doing a research paper and I wanted some opinions. [SEP] best_answer: I love how all the Dems on here give Clinton credit for the economy back in the 90's.  You must remember the president does not have all the power.  The Congress and Senate were both run by Republicans at the time Clinton was in the White House.  Ask this same question to those 18 Army Rangers parents and family members who got killed in the streets of Mogidishu Somalia in Oct. 1993.  NO, he was not a satisfactory president. He was and always will be a womanizer.	Politics & Government
question_title: Is death penalty just !!? [SEP] question_content: In some countries they have death penalty for people who have commited very offensive crimes ,such as murder.Do you think that death penalty is just way of dealing with these people .I mean when a person is found quilty and sentenced to death penalty , isnt that taking his right and only chance to live. In my opinion i think this is wrong, when these people are "SENTENTED TO  DEATH", what good does it really bring to PEOPLE ,It doesnt do any good whatsoever,well except it brings negative things to the family of the sentenced.To understand what i am saying imagine that you are going to be sentenced tommorow , and there is no way of escaping it , how would you feel,react??\nI really  feel sorry for those all who have been sentenced to death, "IT just shows us HOW WE HUMANS ARE STILL UNCIVILIZED". [SEP] best_answer: I don't believe in the death penalty.\nToo many Innocent people have been executed for something they did not do.There are two infamous cases here in Australia where the murderers/rapist were caught red handed within days and admitted they did it,both these individuals have tried to commit suicide while in prison,their crimes against another human being were horrendous and had a great impact on our country not just the state in which it took place,in a case like this I think the judge should be able to in-force the death penalty.\nSome people still think the last man hanged here was innocent and it was done for political reasons.

Their platform is where they stand on the issues, like abortion, federal spending, defense, etc.\n\nPolitical parties are also the vehicle for raising money for the candidates.

question_title: Is it "rude" to speak another language in a group of speakers who do not understand your language? [SEP] question_content: Imagine being in a group social situation where there are mostly English only speaking citizens. You are either a naturalized citizen from another country or an illegal alien who is bilingual. Would you feel totally comfortable speaking only your own language, without any thought for the others around you who might want to hear what you have to say. Doesn't it kinda set up a situation of disrespect? Doesn't this sort of behavior here in the USA come down to being rude? That is: "not sharing" with others? I know it isn't law in the US but it is an issue of respect and giving social respect to those who you are "in with." when you have the multilingual ability, to speak in the tongue of the country you are visiting or have newly become a citizen of? [SEP] best_answer: Yes it is rude, but it seems to be the norm.  There is a joke in California.  There are 2 Vietnamese in an elevator with a 3rd individual.

question_title: Why do people tend to support McCain when it comes to pork barrel spending? Explain use some logic? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Spending works during an econicmic depression. Try to use the depression and WWII and Roosevelts new deal program as an example. \n\nThe govt. built damns in Tenn and Hwys across the country, those projects gave jobs to people, the jobs gave them disposable income (money to sepnd on stuff you dont need) and it generated taxes to repay what the govt invested.\n\nThats why the govt builds bridges to nowhere, or may be they are just trying to rack up a few bucks for their contractor friends. \n\nThe point is that its justified if it serves a purpouse for the public and that the investment can be returned to the govt.\n\n\nIf this doesnt answer, be specific.

question_title: Doesn't the constitution teaches freedom OF religion, not freedom FROM religion? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For the ignorant, in the section:\n\n"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."\n\nThe word "respecting" DOES NOT mean reverence.  It means "with regard to", or "referring to".  Now read it again:\n\n"Congress shall make no law with regard to an establishment of religion," etc.\n\nIt means the government will not make laws establishing a religion.  How, unless one is disingenuous, dishonest, and a "liar for jeezus", can this infer that one religion is preferred over another, or that HAVING a religion is preferred to not having one at all?\n\nAdditional:\n\nLet me return the favour to "The_Dark_Knight" and say this:  To anyone who wants religion in government or schools, you can have it on one condition.  \n\nIt can be any religion EXCEPT your own.  Meaning, christians can't advocate christianity, it has to be something else - hinduism, buddhism, islam, etc.  \n\nThe problem is, the religious do not have the honesty or courage to say what they really mean.  When one says, "We should have religion in schools," what they mean is "We should have MY religion in schools".\n\nThe religious live under the delusion - or deliberate lie - that a secular state means an atheist state.  Wrong.  The most open and advanced countries (socially and scientifically) in history had both a religious population and a secular state.	Politics & Government
