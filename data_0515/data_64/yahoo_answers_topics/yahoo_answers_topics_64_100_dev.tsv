question_title: A question about the eyes? [SEP] question_content: There are two regions of the human retina that differ dramatically from surrounding regions\nwith regard to the type and/or density of photoreceptor cells. What are each of these two\nregions called and what is the importance of each in vision? [SEP] best_answer: There are two types of cells. Rod & cone cells. Rod cells are responsible for black & white vision, cone cells for color vision. at the yellow spot, there are only cone cells, at the other areas of the retina, there are rod cells. At the blind spot, there is neither.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is a 3 digit number divisable by 7 but not 2-The sum of my digits is 4? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Because your result is odd (not divisible by 2), the last digit can't be 0 or 2, so it must be 1 or 3...\n\nIf the last digit is 3, the other digits must add to 1, so you have only one choice:\n103\n\nIf the last digit is 1, the other digits must add to 3, so your choices are:\n121\n211\n301\n\nNow test each one to see if it is divisible by 7:\n103 / 7 = 14.714285...\n121 / 7 = 17.285714...\n211 / 7 = 30.142857...\n301 / 7 = 43\n\nSo the only number that fits your criteria is:\n301\n\n301 is 3 digits\n301 is divisible by 7 (7 x 43)\n301 is *not* divisible by 2\nThe sum of my digits (3 + 0 + 1) is 4.

question_title: what  is the difference between energy and force? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Although the words are used in many ways, science has specific definitions\nfor each.\n\nForce is a push or a pull.  Force is between objects, one object pushing or\npulling on another.\n\nEnergy is more difficult to define, because energy is "abstract".  Energy is\na quantity that gives an object the ability to affect other objects.  There\nare different kinds of energy.  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion,\nstored within a moving object.  Potential energy is stored in the force\nbetween objects, perhaps in the stretch of a spring.  Thermal energy can be\nstored in the temperature of an object.  Energy passes from place to place,\nobject to object, but never disappears.  The total energy of the universe\nremains constant.\n\nFuel is a material that has energy stored in its chemical structure.  When\nfuel is processes (burned, for example), the chemical energy is released.\nThis released energy can become heat and cause the temperature of something\nto rise.  The released energy can become the kinetic energy of a car.  It\ncan become the energy carried by sound to your ears.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: The movement of sediment by the forces of nature is called? [SEP] question_content: These are the possible 4 answers:\n\nA. weathering B. depostion C. erosion D. abrasion [SEP] best_answer: You need to think about this in terms of the question, that is what one of these processes involves movement of sediment.\n\nWeathering does involve movement of sediment, since weathering includes lots of processes that break down rocks into smaller particles or even dissolve rocks. Dissolution of limestone by carbonic acid in water is weathering that 'moves' rock. Freeze-thaw weathering of sandstone breaks the sandstone into smaller particles that are carried away by water, gravity, and wind. \n\nDeposition is the end result of the process of moving sediment, and may be the only one that does not answer your question, but because it is part of the process of 'moving' sediment it probably counts. \n\nErosion definitely moves sediment. Soil, sand, and rock are eroded by moving water and transported to new locations. \n\nAbrasion results in 'moving' sediment. Glaciers abrade underlying rock and grind it into small particles. Wind blows sand grains against rock and abrades it and reduces it to smaller particles. \n\nI think the only correct answer here is "all of the above.”	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What's the carrying capacity of lynx rufus (bobcat)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The carrying capacity is generally very hard to determine. With bobcats it may be near impossible as they do not cram in as many individuals as the land will hold, as a moose or deer will, so carrying capacity is different for them. The carrying capacity will also vary depending on the different habitat, it is generally determined for a type of ecosystem or a particular area. Bobcats set up territories, so the territory range within an acceptable habitat will determine how many bobcats there are. I doubt their population numbers ever even come close to the actual carrying capacity for them. With that said, from what i could find, it looks like there are around 7 bobcats/100km2. Ive attached a link to a good paper discussing bobcat distribution. hope this helps a bit	Science & Mathematics
question_title: determining stoichiometry of Ni and en or EDA by Job's method? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hello,\n\nThe idea behind Job's method is to prepare a series of reaction mixtures (for example solutions) in which the total number of moles of the reactants is fixed but with different ratio. One then plots the number of moles of product vs the ratio. The maximum of the curve will occur at the correct stoichiometric ratio.\n\nIn your case, one could prepare solutions containing a total number of moles (i.e. moles of Ni + moles EDA) equal to 1 with the following composition:\n\nmoles Ni     moles EDA Ratio Ni/EDA\n0.9                0.1           9        \n0.8                0.2           4\n0.6                0.4          1.5\n0.4                0.6          0.666\n0.2                0.8          0.25\n0.0                1.0          0.0\n\nOne then needs to measure the amount of Ni-EDA complex and plot that amount agains the ratio. The maximum will tell you which is the right stoichiometric ratio. Hope this helps. See the web site below for a more complete explanation.\n\nOne then measures the	Science & Mathematics

Even if you were to pour the bubbles in after the water stopped runnning the bubble mixture would still spread evenly throughout the water by simple diffusion.\n2. when you light a scented cande. The scent travels throughout the whole house because it travels from an area of high concentration (right above the candle) to the rest of the areas around the house that have low concentrations of the scent.\nGood? next time do your homework yourself :)	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Should I address my grievance to the management, or sell these inferior goods on the secondary market? [SEP] question_content: Last month I ordered 41 gross of strut bearings for my temporal distorter matrix, since each use of the matrix tends to sublimate the 212 requisite bearings into a silvery Jackson-Pollock-esque mess on the ceiling of my garage. I was assured these bearings were mookie-proof.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the mookination had transpired and was clearly underway. Now, I'm sure you're fully aware of the dire consequences that come when mookine interrupts a temporal rift - we all hang our heads sadly in rememberance of Andrew "Unsafe at any speed" Clayton of Westshireship, who, in 1996, had installed only 4 mookinated bearings in his primitive array of 143, disappeared for two weeks, and came back an inverted penguin.\n\nSo I ask you, should I sell these decidedly non-mookie-proof bearings on the secondary market, or complain to the management? [SEP] best_answer: Sell them on the secondary market. Complaining to management will get you nowhere.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How long is silver nitrate suppose to stay on the wound after cauterization? [SEP] question_content: I had cauterization performed on a wound.  The dried up silver nitrate was left on the skin.  How long am I suppose to leave it on?  Am I suppose to wash it off when I shower? [SEP] best_answer: I don't know where your wound is but if SilNit was applied because the area is sensitive to infection or inflammation, leave it on so long as the wound/skin is still raw or broken. If not, its water soluble so you can wish it off given your PCF states so.SilNit is usually associated wiith infection. However, if it is associated with, and I don't mean to bring this up, gonorrhea leave it on and check with your PCF to get specific info from them as needed.  But it should be ok to wash off so long as the wound is looking presentable with no discomfort.  If the color has darkened a lot, then full exposure to the SilNit has come and gone.  Hope it helps, good luck.  Corrections Welcomed.	Science & Mathematics

(Think of an ice cream cone with its point facing down.) The tank is externally braced to prevent its falling over. If the tank is full of a fluid which weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, find the work done, in foot pounds, correct to the nearest hundred footpounds, in pumping all of the fluid out of the top of the tank.\n\nI received an answer that works but I don't know how they got 20000.  \nBelow is the answer that was posted\nFirst, you need the volume. The formula yields: V = pi rh/3 = 20000pi/3 cubic feet. Since it weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, the ratio 50 lbs/ft.^3 = 1. So multiplying this to our volume equation, V = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 * 50lbs/ft.^3 = 100000pi/3 lbs. The work function is (25-x)100000pi/3 = W(x).

[SEP] question_content: b) What is the area on the map if the actual area is 3.2 km^2? [SEP] best_answer: Part (a)\n4:10000 scale means 4 cm distance on map represents 10000 cm or 100 m. Hence a 12 cm road is actually (12*100/4) = 300 m = 0.3 km long.\n\nPart (b)\nLength scale 4:10000 means area scale is (4*4):(10000*10000) i.e. 16:10^8. This means 10^8 cm^2 area will be represented by 16 cm^2 area on the map. Hence 3.2 km^2 = 3.2*10^10 cm^2 actual area is represented by (16*3.2*10^10/10^8) = 5120 cm^2 area on the map.

question_title: Did matter travel faster than light during big bang? [SEP] question_content: Also, what is the rate of expansion of the universe? and how do we know that it's accelerating and if so, will it (the rate of expansion) reach the speed of light? Can anyone explain in hopefully layman terms? [SEP] best_answer: this is somewhat similar to a question I answered realative to time travel. The short answer is no, there was never a time, nor will there ever be a time when matter (massive fermions) travel faster than light (massless bosons). This is because massive objects need energy to accelerate and regaurdless of how much energy was released in the big bang, it could not have been infinite, and that is what is required to move a massive particle faster than light. Light speed is not a derived measurement, it is a fundemental constant that is the same in all reference frames. Here's the cool exception though.....and this is how a theoretical warp drive would work..... the actual expansion of space itself might have been faster than light. There has never been a limit imposed on the speed at which space expands although because gravity is a result of the deformation of space and gravitons are the theoretical force carrier, it has been assumed that the expansion of space would occur only as fast as gravitons can travel....which is most likely light speed. One of the many postulates asserted by string theory is that gravitons may not be bound to our spatial demensions, that they might radiate through extra demensions (which would account for gravity's lack of strenght compared to the other forces). If this is the case that the gravitons travel through other demensions it is quite possible that within a given reference time, a graviton could pop into a superior demension and back into our at some other point and essentially beat light to some defined location.\n\nI know thats a little confusing.....but its fun to think about.

Much depends on the precise compound being used for her depression, but many of them will cause tiredness as a side effect.  You might get the name and do a quick search on the 'net on it.  (pdr.net might be available to you; worth a try if it is)\n\nOffhand, I'd say there's a whole lot more going on here than you see--and perhaps more than the individual prescribing the antidepressants is aware of, too.  I realize that you feel your Mom is the one with the problem--you may well be right, too--but if I were in your shoes, I'd seek counseling.  You've got personal stresses generated by having to cope with this; those will take their toll on you, over time, if you don't get some assistance.  If you're still in pre-collegiate school, find a counselor to talk to; no matter what level of training you're in, maybe your clergy of choice would be a reasonable place to turn; or a professional counselor.\n\nYou can't solve your mom's problem; that's a guarantee.  She has to face it and solve it herself, though you can help her in that process.  All you can do is the best you can to keep her problems from damaging you.\n\nHope I've made sense...

question_title: (3x + 4)/6 = 2/5? [SEP] question_content: i was confused on this again [SEP] best_answer: Well, first you want to isolate the "x".  So, divide out the left side-this gets you 3x/6 + 4/6 = 2/5.  Take 4/6 from each side, so x/2 = 2/5 - 4/6.  You have to make the fractions have the same denominator, so you get x/2 = 12/30-20/30, or x/2 = -8/30.  Now multiply each side by 2, so you get x = -16/30, or x = -8/15.\nplug it back in to check, so (-24/15 + 60/15)/6 is the same as (36/15)/6, which is the same as 6/15, which reduces to 2/5.  O Ho! We got it!  x DOES equal -8/15..  That was fun-I havent done that kind of math for a long time..	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why are yawns contagious? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yawns are contagious because most of us when seeing another yawn, we will hold our breath unintentionally...those few seconds cause a lack of oxygen which is what makes people yawn! Try it out next time you see someone yawn...make a point to make sure you breathe regularly and you'll see that you won't yawn.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: how far??? [SEP] question_content: if your looking outside how far can  a person see in a distance? [SEP] best_answer: On a clear dark night you can see galaxies millions of lightyears away.  The horizon you see depends on how high above the ground you are.  One approximate formula for the distance in miles to the horizon is:\n distance =sqrt(1.5 x height)  \nso if I'm 6 feet above the flat ground or better yet a flat ocean, my horizon is sqrt(9) = 3 miles.  This would work really well if the Earth were smooth like a bowling ball, but its rough and has mountains and valleys and hills and trees so the formula is idealized.  See wikipedia "horizon"\n In Modern industrialized countries, pollution often makes it difficult to see more than 20 miles unless you are way up in an airplane.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does the University of South Carolina have any mountains or rivers located on or near it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The University of South Carolina has several campuses, the main one being in Columbia where the School of Medicine is located. Columbia is in the lowlands and the Congaree River runs through the city about one mile from the  center of campus.\n\nThe nearest mountains of any size are the Great Smoky Mountains which are located at the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, about 200 miles (3 - 4 hours) North of Columbia. They are awesome and offer a lot of recreational activities but would make for a fairly long day trip from Columbia.\n\nThe USC Spartanburg campus is much closer to the mountains (1.5 - 2 hours) but is not near any rivers.\n\nWK	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Which part of the human brain releases dopamine & what are its effects? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Dopamine is not produced only in the brain. it is produced in a number of areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems -- chiefly in the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, and the caudad.  \n \nDopamine plays a role in many different physiological processes, including skeletal movement to drug addiction. In addition dopamine's activities have been linked to cardiovascular, renal, hormonal, and central nervous systems.  \n \nBoth an excess of or deficiency of dopamine can cause disorders.  A deficiency in the striatum or substantia nigra results in Parkinson’s-like symptoms.  In this case, movement becomes slow and rigid, accompanied by muscle tremors. Drugs, such as L-DOPA, are used to alleviate these symptoms.  An excessive amount of dopamine is associated with schizophrenia.  Certain drugs, such as cocaine, block the return of dopamine into the brain, resulting in a build up of dopamine in the synapses, leading to drug-induced psychosis or schizophrenia.

question_title: wht is Fallen astronaut?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Fallen Astronaut is an 8.5-cm aluminum sculpture of an astronaut in a spacesuit. It is the only piece of art on the Moon.\n\nIt was created by Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, who met astronaut David Scott at a dinner party. Van Hoeydonck was asked to create a small statuette to personally commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts having lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration. Van Hoeydonck was given a set of design restrictions: in addition to the physical requirements that the sculpture be both lightweight and sturdy, and that it be capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon, the statuette could not be identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. Furthermore, in accordance with Scott's wish to avoid the commercialization of space, Van Hoeydonck's name would not be made public.\n\nIn 1971, Fallen Astronaut was placed on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 15, along with a plaque bearing the names of fourteen American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts who died during spaceflights or training exercises.\n\nAfter the crew mentioned the statuette during their post-flight press conference, the National Air and Space Museum requested that a replica be made for public display. The crew agreed, under the condition that it was to be displayed "with good taste and without publicity"; in April of 1972, Van Hoeydonck presented the Museum with a replica of Fallen Astronaut, which is now on display with a replica of the plaque.\n\nIn May of 1972, Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make more replicas and sell them. Feeling that this would be a violation of the spirit of their agreement, Scott tried to persuade Van Hoeydonck to refrain, but was unsuccessful; 950 signed replicas went on sale for $750 apiece at the Waddell Gallery of New York.\n\nHope this helps.

question_title: Is there end for universe? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Universe is expanding, but it doesn't have a phyiscal start, middle, or an end.  It's going to expand forever. Don't think about it, because it's not something our mind can really grasp.\n\nHere's an analogy that helped me:\n\nImagine the Universe as a two dimensional place.  The Universe is the surface of a rubber ball.  There's no start, finish, or middle.  As the Universe expands, the rubber ball fills with air.  Still no start, finish, or middle.\n\nFor a long time, it was unknown whether the Universe was open or closed, meaning whether the Universe would expand forever or eventually collapse back on itself back to nothing.\n\nThe hubble telescope proved that the Universe it open and would expand forever.

question_title: Is anybody studying or has studied TEFL? [SEP] question_content: Any advice? Worth it? If you are now teaching, where are you working and how good is the money? Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: The TEFL is an excellent course. It will take you anywhere you want to go. You can do the course online or at your local college or learning centre. There are also variations of the course available. However, depending on where you are going you may not need one (although it's good to have a backup) For example if you go to Thailand or Bangkok you can easily pick up work teaching English. A friend of mine found work in a day and carried on to be very successful there. In places like Thailand when teaching English the student you teach are paying for the privilege and must try to speak only English while in your class.\nThe money you'll be paid there is good when compared to the national average and is enough to give you a descent standard of living. Over there you can live well on about £350 a month. You'll find accommodation and costs of living to be less than western countries. If you're thinking of travelling and working abroad you should try getting in contact with different charities that do projects in these countries and ask them about it. They'll be able to give allot of good information relating to the place you have in mind. They'll be able to give you a more accurate estimate of how much it will cost you and such.\n\nGood Luck honey, if you go, have a blast... You'll love it!	Education & Reference

I just went to one of the worst I.E.P.'s we've had yet.  These schools just want you to increase your kids meds. What's the point of them deeming your child Emotionally Impaired if they still expect him to act and function like all the rest and act shocked when he doesn't.  Now they want to send him to summer school and I can't provide the transport cuz I have to work!  Anyone have any suggestions? I'd really like to hear some feedback in regards to the summer school (or lack of going). thanks, DBMOM [SEP] best_answer: Here are some places to start:\n\nhttp://www.chaddmi.com/\nhttp://www.bridges4kids.org/PAC.html (scroll down to list of parent advocacy groups)\nhttp://www.bridges4kids.org/HelpForKids.html\nhttp://www.conductdisorders.com/\nhttp://www.wrightslaw.com/\nhttp://www.causeonline.org/\n\n\nFor someone who is ED, learning proper behavior is difficult. For the "normal" person, behavior reflects feelings, and is appropriate for the social context. However, B/ED people have feelings that do not match their environment, and/or their natural behavioral responses are not socially acceptable.  Therefore, their big challenge in learning is to build "unnatural" behavior patterns to meet society's expectations. The world will not change to fit them...they must change to fit the world. Life is not fair...and never has been.\n\nThe purpose of special education is to help children who are different, learn to function effectively in the mainstream society. If your child does not learn to control his own behavior by the time he is an adult, he WILL end up in prison (the prison population is full of people with ADHD, ED, etc.). \n\nYour son is not in special education to be coddled, "allowed to be himself," or enabled in his use of maladaptive behaviors. He is in special education so that he can be guided toward appropriate behaviors.\n\nThe question you should be raising is not "why are they appearing to attack my son?" but rather "Are they providing appropriate instruction in behavior skills so that HE can learn to control himself?" AND "Am I being trained, as a parent, in these techniques so that I can use them at home and provide him with stability across all environments?"  AND "What am I already doing at home to bring about changes in his behavior so that my baby boy won't spend a life behind bars?"	Education & Reference

question_title: could you please elaborate to me the relationship between research and pedagogy? [SEP] question_content: how can pedagogy be a theory? [SEP] best_answer: I like to think of pedagogy as the art of teaching a particular subject.  The way to explain topics so that they are best understood in an effiecient way.  \nWith that said, a theory is an idea that has not been proved or disproved.  I think that because we have not perfected the way people learn best, that within pedagogy there can be theories about how people learn.\n\nResearch usually has more to do with collecting information.  When we do research for papers, we gather information to prove our point from a variety of sources.  Scientific research gathers information through experiments to support a hypothesis.

question_title: Where is the best Paramedic School in the US? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There really isn't a "best" school.\nEvery area has basically the same content that has to be taught in the class.  Every class is going to focus a bit more on the things you'll see in that area.  Case in point... Indiana school isn't going to teach a GREAT deal on poisonous snake bits because they don't have many poisonous snakes.  Go near the ocean and they will focus strongly on drownings.  The criteria for the classes are set at a national level and therefore, the basics of the classes will all be the same.	Education & Reference
question_title: I've just been diagnosed dyslexic, and find it hard to motivate myself to start assignments. Any advice? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Wow, your doctor is full of shit. Just, wow.\n\nDyslexia doesn't make sense for the inability to focus. A simple test: bdqp. What does that say? If you can read that and know which sequence it is, you aren't even dyslexic in the right way to effect reading at all. You could have a problem called ADD, or you could have a combination of the two like I did. ADD means you can't focus and get easily distracted, among other things:\n\nScan these:\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diseases_and_conditions/add_adhd.htm\nhttp://borntoexplore.org/whatisadd.htm\n\nThere is no easy way to deal with ADD, other than learning to cope. For the dyslexia, I just had to grow out of it (but still confuse right and left once in a while) I still don't study well unless I retreat to someplace quiet where there are practically no distractions, like a library. Ritalin is one solution, but you may or may not like its effects. My brother took the stuff and it didn't do a damn thing, but it helps some people.\n\nThe only plus side is that you will probably make a good scientist or engineer or artist anything where you need visualization skills. I can't do abstract math, but with a physics problem where there is something to visualize I am faster than blue blazes. I also do photography well enough to get recognized as art, although I lack the coordination or patience for drawing by hand. I can also think in five dimensions, but I haven't found a use. Perhaps you will be an architect or a sculptor? Thomas Edison was probably ADD too.\n\nRemember the trick about going to a library or something to study!	Education & Reference

question_title: Does it affect your performance in the exam whether you have breakfast in the morning or not?

If you got a splinter on that morning, your focus sure would be distrated from the exam.  If one of your friends ignored you that morning, it sure would affect your thinking.  So something as simple as having a routine breakfast does make a difference.\n\nThe very best a person can do just prior to an exam is to keep everything as calm and normal as reasonable.

question_title: who is Captain Hook? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Captain Hook\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \nCaptain Hook as seen in the Disney version of Peter Pan.Captain James Hook is the (so-called) villain of J. M. Barrie's play and novel Peter Pan. Hook is a pirate captain and Peter Pan's nemesis. It is said that he was Blackbeard's bosun, and that he was the only man Long John Silver ever feared. He wears an iron hook in place of his left hand, which was cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a crocodile; the crocodile liked the taste of him so much that it follows him around constantly, hoping for more. Hook hates Peter obsessively, and lives for the day he can make Peter and all his Lost Boys walk the plank.\n\nLest anyone think Hook's name too convenient, Barrie notes that "Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze." Barrie also suggests through several clues that the Captain was an Old Etonian - in Barrie’s short story “Jas Hook at Eton,” Hook’s final words before jumping overboard are “Floreat Etona” (115).\n\nIn Barrie's play and novel, Hook kidnaps Wendy, the girl who loves Peter and whom Peter views as his surrogate mother, and challenges the boy to a final duel. When Hook is bested and must choose between surrender and death, he commits suicide by throwing himself into the waiting jaws of the crocodile. Just before dying, however, he takes a final jab at Peter by taunting him about his "bad form". Peter, with the callousness of youth, quickly forgets Hook and finds a new nemesis, but as Hook made a stronger impression on the public, most sequels brought him back one way or another.\n\nThe symbolism of Peter Pan's fight with Captain Hook (traditionally played by the same actor as Wendy's father), combined with Hook's fear of time in the form of the ticking crocodile, possibly hints at Jungian subtext.\n\nIt is hypothesized that Captain Hook was modeled after the famous English captain Christopher Newport. Both were dark-haired captains of dubious pasts, and both were missing their right hands which were replaced by metal hooks. Newport commanded the ships that landed the settlers at Jamestown in Virginia. He also seems to have a distinctive similarity to Bartholomew Roberts, especially regarding his choice of clothes and his impeccable manners, although Barrie specifically associates his dress and hairstyle with that of King Charles II of England.\n\nAnother hypothesis claims that Captain James Hook could represent Captain James Cook, the British captain who discovered both Australia and New Zealand. The Lost Boys symbolize the Maoris, who inhabit New Zealand, or the Aborigines, who inhabit Australia.\n\nSmee is Captain Hook's bosun and right-hand man, so to speak.	Education & Reference
question_title: Why do teachers ignore certain students? [SEP] question_content: This doesnt happen to me often, but it happened a lot in this one certain class.  I had an A+ in the class because I did the homework and took tests well, but the teacher still treated me terribly campared to the other kids.  They were allowed to start open discussions without having to raise hands and whatever.  So I thought that was cool.  But when ever I made a comment she refused to respond or 'shushed' me; which I found extremely degrading.  Also I found her to be very fake and a lot of what she told us about the world was wrong.  Her facts were totally wrong and these were like common knowledge to me.  So I would say my comment to say that she was wrong, but believe me I did this respectfully.  But she gave me a dirty look and continued with her 'mind-tainting' lecture.  It was absurd.  Why would she do that? Does she just not know better? (oh yea she isnt a new teacher, apparently she's been doing this like forever) [SEP] best_answer: My son's first experience in school in Kindergarten got him one of those teachers.  We butted heads all the time.  She labeled him a trouble maker because he didn't stay on task and wanted to move faster than the class did.  I told her that she was wrong so I was the demanding parent.\n\nTeachers come in all types and some are just not good or have worn out their welcome.  Some fear change.  Some are threatened easily and when there is a smart student they feel it and react badly.\n\nIf there is an issue that she is wrong about (or any teacher in the future too) bring in proof that you are right in writing.  I did and, yes it made my teacher MAD, but the other students then started to question her and she was forced to prove herself the rest of the way through.  You may not be the favorite in class with that teacher but you will be respected by your fellow students.  If the teacher threatens to fail you for speaking up (like mine did) go higher up (principal, dean, etc) with the proof.\n\nYou're an A+ student.  Let her know it!	Education & Reference
question_title: Is an SAT score of 1770 okay? [SEP] question_content: Or should I retake it? [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like the new scoring systems has everyone a bit confused... some schools asked for all three scores, but only consider the reading & math scores.\n\nHere are average scores on the most recent test: 520 math and 508 verbal for a combined score of 1028.  The most selective schools (e.g., ivy league) typically had SAT averages north of 1400 (combined math & verbal, not all three tests).\n\nSo I guess it's a question of how you did on the math & verbal, and what is your goal in terms of schools.  You can find out what your target schools' average SAT scores for entering Freshmen by looking on their websites or contacting their admissions offices.	Education & Reference

question_title: in act 5 scene 1 of hamlet can u describe the attitude towards corruption expressed by Horatio? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Horatio doesn't say much in act 5, scene 1. Consider that he's Hamlet's foil throughout the play, then look at Horatio's response to Hamlet's comments about the lawyers and politicians who used to be those skulls. He responds very gently to Hamlet's tirades, and seems like he's there to say, "yes, corruption is bad, but it's within some people, and they are now skulls, so they got what's coming to them" and wants to assure Hamlet to despise corruption, but tolerate it and be true to himself.\n\nLook at Horatio's first line in the scene, "Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness". It seems his function in that scene is to let Hamlet know that people are made by their social status	Education & Reference

Both are hard core and will want you to convert so one is going to have to make up their mind. If you don't want to convert you need to explain to your significant other that it's not an option and if they don't understand oh well. I love my husband but if he told me that he had converted to Catholisism and that I had to convert or else I would tell him sorry. First people you love should ask you to go against your faith and secondly no man or woman on this earth should be more important to you than God. If you believe that all you have to do is ask forgivness and that you shall recieve redemption then certain other beliefs are going to stick in your craw anyways. But hey, it's up to you...\n\n(p.s. Before I start getting hate mail folks please keep in mind that I don't dislike or hate Catholics at all nor am I anti-Catholic in any way. All the Catholics I know are cool people. The only point I'm trying to stress is that someone who is a hard core Baptist (enough to put that title in with a question, which means it's important to them) is going to have problems with the Catholic faith in general and vice versa.

question_title: Why does IM face ooks yellow sometimes and it looks grey otherwise...Thanks...? [SEP] question_content: In my mail list, sometimes the contacts have yellow IM faces, but other times it looks grey. Why is That? [SEP] best_answer: yellow means they're online and appearing visibly online to you (and possibly others), and grey means they're not signed in, or have chosen to appear offline so as not to be bothered  :-)\n\nAnd sometimes it's retarded for whatever reason.  Like when I get 50 messages at night while I'm sleeping because apparently something somewhere says I'm available when I haven't been signed in for 6 hours.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Communication is the base of any good relationship. He may have insecurity problems and god knows what else, but if you are afraid to address the issue with him, how do you expect this problem to be solved? Relationships take lots of work, communication, dedication and understanding. The truth is nobody is perfect and at some point in any relationship some things need to be addressed in order to be fixed. Sometimes professional help is needed. But you need to acknowledge the problem and let the other person know. Failing to do so will make your life miserable and you will end up taking !@#$ from future people you dont have to.

This will tell the people you must be telling the truth, and she is not going to want to take it this far and should back off. I know it sounds a little out there, but if she is a trouble maker, sometimes publicity is the only way to shut them up, and you don't have to mention names to make her face beet red. You want to put your name of course, and they will know who you are talking about without you getting a lawsuit.	Family & Relationships

What do you think?  is it me or him? What would you do?  I  guess I should mention age ..We are in our 30's. [SEP] best_answer: Maybe he wants to wait or he is just scared of taking such a big step.  You can never see what is going to happen and he wants to be careful becuase he doesn't want to mess up what u have. Just be there for him and tell him that its okay and you'll wait for him.  That's all he wants.	Family & Relationships

I have not been dating or single for 14 yrs and I am not sure if I am getting the right signals from her. She smiles and stops me all the time. How do I go about asking her out with out making a fool of myself. [SEP] best_answer: Making a fool of yourself is the fun part of asking girls out.  You think they are too good for you and you think that you can't approach them and then you come up with an elaborate way to ask them and then she's like "sure."  And you are completely blown away by the fact that she is totally knows how you are stressing for days about asking her out (they have a gift dawg).\nAsk her to hang out at like happy hour then a movie and then tell her that you enjoyed your time with her and would like to spend more one-on-one time with her.

question_title: Is it ok for you 2 date/ like your best friend's ex? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on how serious they were...If she was really into him, and is still hurting from the relationship, then obviously, No. But if they have moved on and have remained friends, and can look back at their relationship and laugh, then Yes. I was in that situation and my friend actually suggested that I get with her ex, because it was so obvious that we had chemistry. Sometimes girls fall so hard for guys that we become blind to others feelings though, so make SURE your friend is okay with it. But even if she isn't, if it's meant to be with the guy, it will be.

question_title: Why do Male Child molestors get more time than Female Child Molestors? [SEP] question_content: Just from watching the news and stuff it seems like a female that has sex with a underage child will be treated reasonably different than if a male does it. To me it's just as disgusting either way. I could be worng so if you can correct me go ahead no need to be rude about it. [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately men are perceived as more aggressive, even brutal sometimes when it comes to sexual gratification. Some really sick men even have sex with the dead. Women on the other hand are seen as 'weaker' vessels? So they are given the benefit of the doubt ...maybe she was 'over powered' ! The circumstances of each case differs of course . I doubt whether such molestations from women were ever envisaged. But I agree with you its disgusting whoever does it. As the frequency of arrests mounts for women the existing laws that do not adequately address the issue would definitely have to be amended. I know there are no separate laws for men and women. But by the judges shed their personal prejudices and be bold enough to apply punishment across board evenly.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Does it make sense that the oldest profession in the world be a sin? [SEP] question_content: Does it make sense that sharing the flesh that God and/or Nature gives us between consenting partners, even if it is for enterprise, to be wrong?  Aren't we just rejoycing in the gifts that this physical life has to offer?  Doesn't it seem proper to maximize the primary purpose of your being?  If it is a sin, then does this mean that the most famous biblical prostitue, MM, not achieve the preferred afterlife, or was she forgiven?  Assuming that some will agree that prostitution is a sin which can be forgiven, then how is it then that gay relations, be an unforgivable sin?  Would not God love all his children without prejudice?  Where once I had a difficult time accepting gays as an acceptable culture, it seems that over the years, my thinking changed to become far more accepting and less judging.  How can we divide ourselves so distinctly and expect to be so correct?  Is not tolerance and patience a virtue?  Lots of questions that boil down to probably a simple answer of faith?

The majority of people in England and Northern Ireland are Protestants. There are actually Catholics and Protestants on either side.\n\nThe terrorists on either side if the issue are not Christian in any sense of the word.\n\nWith love in Christ.	Society & Culture

question_title: Should we not want DEMOCRACY IN HEAVEN? [SEP] question_content: In the bible god has ruled and lost control of mankind many times than he acts out by changing languages ( TOWER OF BABEL ), mass murder ( THE FLOOD )  to control mankind.\n NO ONE PERSON  ( GOD )SHOULD HOLD ALL POWER, [SEP] best_answer: God didn't lose control.  He made people able to choose right or wrong.  Being people, we often choose wrong.  \n\nAlso, there's about a million reasons why God should be in charge: he made everything, he knows everything, he is perfectly just, he's all-powerful, he's all-present, he's outside of time (so he never runs out of time), and besides all this, he loves us!\n\nThe reason that he changed the languages at the tower of babel and wiped out the earth's population during the flood is that he is just and fair.  See, the hard thing to understand is that God deserves to be the Ruler over everything, including us, and when we rebel against him, we are the ones who are wrong.  That's the definition of sin-- rebellion against God.  So because the people building the tower of babel and all the people on earth(except for Noah) were rebelling against God, God in his infinate justice punished them, because justice demanded it, and he had the right to do so.\n\nIt's hard for us to understand, especially because we innately know that a person would be wrong to wipe out the world's poplulation or punish people for trying to userp them.  But because God is God, he's right to do so.\n\nIn fact, we all sin, and the just punishment for sin is eternal separation from God (otherwise known as hell).  No person on earth could possibly earn their way to heaven, because the requirenment for getting into heaven is perfection, which none of us has ever, or can ever, acheive.  So if God is just, he should punish us with eternal separation from him.  However, God also loves us, and he wants to spend eternity with us in heaven.  So, God came up with a plan, The perfect plan.\n\nHe sent his son, Jesus Christ, down to earth, to be born in a stable in Bethlahem.  Jesus is the only person who ever lived his entire life without sinning once.  He never sinned because not only is he 100% man, but he is also 100% God AT THE SAME TIME.  During his 33 years on earth, Jesus proved that he was God's son, and the savior of the world by preforming miracles and fulfulling thousands of prophecies that were given to the Jewish people hundreds and thousands of years before he was born.\n\nAfter living perfectly for 33 years on earth, Jesus came into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, knowing that he would be put to death that Friday.  He could have stayed away from Jerusalem, or called angels down to stop his execution at any time, but he didn't.  He willingly gave his life because he knew that his death was part of God's plan.  Jesus was to live a perfect life, then die on the cross as punishment for the sins of every person who ever lived.  Jesus was whipped within an inch of his life, mocked, spit upon, forced to carry a wooden cross up to the hill where he was crucified on it, pierced by nails in his hands and feet, finally hung on a cross, where he was taunted and ridiculed until he died.  But far worse than the physical torture, Jesus, who had never sinned, took on all of the sins that you and I and the human race have ever committed.  He had to feel the guilt and shame of things he had never done, and he had to be separated from God.   Finally, Jesus died.  Jesus did all of this willingly for you, and he would have done it even if you were the only person on earth.  He loved you so much that he would rather die this horrible death than go through eternity without you.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there!  Jesus was laid in a tomb, where he stayed for three days, but on the third day, he came back to life!  This is the real meaning of Easter! After rising from the dead, he stayed on earth for forty days and appeared to more than 500 of his followers before ascending to heaven.\n\nIf you don't wake up tomorrow, do you know for sure where you're going?  Because of Jesus' sacrifice, your sins can be forgiven and you can be made right with God, know for sure that you will go to heaven when you die, and start 	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: When I was little I had a chess game with bright yellow and lime-green pieces lol!! Now I wonder, was it designed by aliens??? \n\nDid you know chess is the oldest skill game in the world. It was first played in China, Persia and India. The Arabs invasions to Persia and then Spain helped spread the game accross Europe. \n\nEuropeans gave chess pieces the names we know today. \nThe game represents the way common people and nobles lived in midieval times.\n\nThe Pawns represent laborers. \n\nI think in our world we still have 'pawns', think about the mulit-million dollar companies outsourcing to take advantage of cheap labor in other countries. \n\nAre pawns only in men's games? well, I don't quite know how to answer that question... but if we take a look at mother nature you can find that bees have 'pawns' (or the worker bees) and the life of bees are somewhat structured like this midieval game, so to answer your question I guess it all depends on the insect or the animal you are studying... including humans lol!!\n\nThe castle piece on a chess board is the home, or the refuge, just as it was a home in medieval times. In chess, each side has two castles, or rooks, as they are sometimes called. \nSo which is more powefull the rook or the castle? neither it is the same piece with a different name\n\nThe knight on a chess board represents the professional soldier of medieval times whose job it was to protect persons of rank.\n\nI don't think a regular horse would move in an 'L' but I always imagined that the horse was jumping...\n\nInteresting your comparison between racial 'wars' and chess wars. However, I don't think eliminating this game from the shelves would help in the hostility between races.\n\nHere is what the other pieces represent:\n\nThere is a bishop in the game of chess, who represents the church\n\nThe queen is the only piece on the board during a chess game that represents a woman, and she is the most powerful piece of the game.\n\nThe king is the tallest piece on the board, and is as well defended on the chessboard as in medieval life.

After you determine what is the most important aspect of your life, then make sure to spend each day doing what you love.  For example, if family is most important, then make sure you spend time with your family each day.  You can even multitask...say you love baseball, then spend an hour playing catch with your kids.  This would be a great way to spend time with the family and play baseball everyday.  Mix it up, make it interesting.  Remember it's your life, and you decide what to do with your time.

If we were god's children, we wouldn't think up things like semi-automatic weapons, chemical weapons, or atomic bombs.  If you want to get biblical, I believe we are Adam's children.  Genesis says that Adam and Eve deliberately disobeyed god and chose to go their own way.  When they did that, they ceased being god's children and became independent of god. I think that makes more sense, just for the plain fact of how we're living nowadays. \n\nSo to answer your question, no, I don't think this Jesus fellow was like you.	Society & Culture

question_title: Were Bush's questions staged? [SEP] question_content: It seemed like those questions were terribly convenient for him.  They all were prefaced by saying something like "I just want to thank you for protecting us.." or something which played right into his hands.  Could it be any more obvious?  And, well if everyone knows that it was fake, why even do it?  Are we watching these things for entertainment value, like pro wrestling? [SEP] best_answer: Bush is very effective at this.  You can only go to his functions if you agree with and worship him.  Everyone gets background checks months in advance.  He has a script to read and every person in the audience who gets to ask a question has their part of the script.  Bush can't think on his feet or at all really, so he would never be able to answer somebody's question if he didn't already have the correct Public Relations answer.  \n\nOther elected officials do this somewhat, but not to the same level as Bush.  He lives in a fantasy land in his presidency.  \n\nAlso, I have a feeling if you didn't ask your scripted question, you'd be taken secretly to Guatanamo Bay as a 'terrorist'.	Politics & Government

question_title: Tax cuts for the 'Rich'? [SEP] question_content: Can anyone show me the 'tax cut for the rich' that all the liberals seem to talk about all the time?\n\nCan any of you liberals show me the specifics of the tax cut?  Or do you just say it because you think it sounds good? [SEP] best_answer: Example 1:  Capital Gains Tax cut.\n\nCapital Gains tax was cut by republicans from 27 percent to 15 percent.  The capital gains tax is a tax that you pay on a certain type of investment income called a "Capital Gain" an example of a capital gain is the profit you make when you buy stock and it goes up in value and then you sell it.  Capital Gains is one type of income that is not made by working.  \n\nCapital Gains taxes are paid by people who make lots of money on capital invetments, by definition they must make more than they lose on their other capital investments in order to pay the tax.  Capital Gains taxes are not placed on retirement investment such as 401K with a few exceptions.\n\nMost middle class people make a tiny percent of their income through capital gains, this is because most middle class people ahve their stock in a retirement account which doesnt pay capital gains.  Most "RICH" people have already maxed out their retirement acocunt contributions and make a much larger share of their income on capital gains.  \n\nSo when there is a capital gains tax cut, the Rich benefit the most.  Their investment income (that they make from NOT WORKING) is now taxed at a much lower rate than most americans WORKING income, including their own.  Many rich people have also figured out a way to turn their regular income into Capital Gains income through creative (but not illegal) accounting, so they are also getting a tax cut on their normal income. \n\nThis is an example of a TAX CUT FOR THE RICH.  Massive tax cut for the rich, hardly anything for middle class.\n\nExample 2:  Dividend Tax Cut\n\nCongress passed a Dividend Tax cut this year, reducing the tax rate on another type of investment income (a type of income that doesnt involve WORK), where people who own shares of stock and other assets receive cash payments for each share they own.  Repulbicans slashed the top divided rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.  This is now much lower than the income tax rate that the same people would pay on their income if they worked for it.\n\nAgain, regular people don't own enough stock to get very many dvidents.  Througought my entire life, I think I've made about 1000 dollars on dividends.  THE RICH benefit greatly from these tax cuts, since many rich people, especially older rich people, recieve a lot of dividend income.  \n\nGeorge Bush, on his 2005 tax return, saved about 26,000 dollars from these tax cuts.  I didn't make enough of this investment income to even qualify.  Most americans don't.\n\n\nExample 3:  Estate Tax\n\nFinally, the republicans tried unsuccessfully to cut the ESTATE TAX down to 0%.  The estate tax is a tax that people like Paris Hilton pay, when they inherit more then 2 million dollars from a dead realative that for some reason, has not already transferred his entire fortune to his children already.  If you don't inherit more than 2 million dollars then you don't pay the tax. If you inherit 2 million and two dollars, then you only pay estate tax on the 2 dollars in excess of two million.  \n\nIt is not a tax on the dead person, it's a tax on the person taht recieves all that money by inheriting it. (NOT WORKING)\n\nI don't think i have to explain why the middle class doesn't pay this tax.\n\nSo there are three examples of "TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH" That most people will never benefit from.  I hope that is clear.  The basic philosophy of republicans seems to be that the higher your income and the more income you make from not working, then the more you should get back in tax cuts.  \n\nI hope people realize how unfair the recent republican tax cust have been and vote this November.

[SEP] question_content: Can anyone think of a good Christmas present for a friend of mine who is stationed in Iraq right now.  Your opinion is particlarly valued if you are in the service and have been over there.  I don't know what my friend would need or miss from home.  I do know that this base has many more amenities than others, but I don't know what comforts the soldiers go without.  Thanks for your help!\n\nPS- if you have any other tips (mailing to Iraq or maybe I should send him more than one thing because his friend might need something, etc.) please don't hesitate to include these. [SEP] best_answer: I'm here in Taji right now and I can honestly tell you it doesnt matter, send anything that come to mind, receiving anything in the mail is the perfect gift, just to know someone is thinking about you and cares. To go with your follow up, its always awesome for you to send extras of whatever or at least two, because typically you live two to a room over here, and you dont know if that person is gonna receieve anything or not. Much better to brighten two soldiers day instead of one........sidenote- if your friends a smoker, cigarettes are always the best gift one could ask for,....wait no, a smuggling of alcohol is even better, Listerine bottles filled with Crown Royal work wonderfully.

If I were a liberal, even if I had JUST left the labotomy table, I would still understand that liberals should run as Socialists.  Feel free to disagree if you can think of a reason why liberals should still run as Democrats.

question_title: Lady congresswoman from Ohio. Called Rep. John Murtha a coward. Will she be reelected. Any patriots there? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes, she's in an extremely Republican district that has been gerrymandered to produce Republican candidates from this district. Her opposition when she was initially elected in 2005 was Paul Hackett, who is now well known and is a democratic Iraq war veteran, and she still won 52% to 48%. Hackett is the strongest opposition and he is not running next time, so it's almost certain she'll be re-elected just out of party loyalty in the district.	Politics & Government
question_title: why goverment doesnt want hispanic people in here ?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't think the government doesn't want latino here... the government doesn't want any more immigrants in the U.S period! since the influx of immigrants is getting to a point where it's creating problems for the economy of the country as a whole.  Why is that? well, all these people even though they're here in the country illegally, and I'm sure that their sole intention is to do well and to be able to help their family back home and to do better for themselves... however, if things doesn't turn out the way they hope it would be, and they're not getting much support from the government, some of those immigrants will ended up doing anything possible to survive, that being said anything whether good/bad to make a living and I believe that's what the government is trying to end.  It is sad because after all, the U.S is made of immigrants and to be able to stop something that a whole country was built by.. is really not a solution.  I think that although their action is understandable by trying to restrict the influx of immigrants, however... other methods could have been used to help those who sees the U.S as their only way to a better way of living.

question_title: why does America still refuse to sign up in full to the Kyoto deal? [SEP] question_content: i believe america is one of the biggest polluters in the world ,i maybe wrong.by the way i am not moaning about americans .i just wondered if big company's decide policies [SEP] best_answer: The Kyoto Accords are actually less stringent than those proposed by several large US corporations. The reason the US has opted out of the Kyoto Accords is primarily because the accords call for a standardized implementation across all industries, which would be 1) extremely expensive; 2) not really reduce the overall emissions. The Kyoto Accords would not credit industries or companies that have already implemented more advanced and beneficial pollution cutting measures, and do not allow for a phase out period for industries to gradually close older, less environmentally friendly plants.  While it seems that America is ignoring environmental policy by not following Kyoto, the overall level of pollution will be reduced by not signing on. Also, the cost savings can be used to help retrofit some existing plants, and build new more environmentally friendly ones while adding jobs to the US economy.	Politics & Government

Your age doesn't allow you to break the rules, even if you where 60yo and going back to get your HS Dipolma they could still take it away from you.  They can of course call your parents, even if you don't live with them.  This continues into college with one exception for college.

His father was indicted for a business deal in 95 , but he was cleared of wrong-doing...So that is where that tag comes from. \n Harold Ford Jr has impeccable credentials,He is honest, He has never been involved in any corruption. He is clean as a whistle . He is a Christian which appealed to most people here. He is a Conservative Democrat: Also attractive to locals. He voted against partial bith Abortion, Supported 2nd amendmant, Voted against Gay marriage. He is the most conservative Democrat in the State....\n His problem: He was a black man running for Senator in The White South....Sad isn't it...We have really come a long way... We are just not there yet....I have no doubt...If he had been white and had the same positions politically ...He would have been elected....\n People here would never admit that it was race nor would Mr. Ford because, that does not help him at all ..it would only hurt him to appear to play the race card.....I live here...I am white...He was hands down the most attractive candidate...He lost...Why? \nYou decide.....

question_title: Why, since Bush became president do people seem to have digressed in race relations? Why is it ok? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Usually race relations in this country has more to do with black and white than anything else.  The reason why there is such a divide with the Bush administration and most black people is that black people typically are not the wealthier crust of society (or a Bush).  Exception of course is extended to Clarence Thomas.  Whereas Bush has nothing against white/black, his actions often signify a reverend indifference to matters of social-economic class, his tax cuts, specifically capital gains; which he hopes to make a 0% tax bracket which would cost nearly a trillion dollars to an already over stretched budget in under a decade reflects an elitist ideology that neglects to realize there are people who haven't been coddled their entire lives.  He bought his way out of military service similarly to J.P. Morgan, been bought out of every trouble and jam, drinking, drugs etc; have been bought companies on a repeated basis to only have them fail or depreciate in value before he sells them, sometimes illegally.  And handed the presidency as a legacy on a strictly party line vote, well kinda, 7 declared republicans were on the bench at the time of the decision in 2000, though Stevens and Souter often are most likely the most liberal republicans in the history of the world.  \n\nWhen Katrina hit, it was evident of Bush's misunderstanding of the situation, he has no regard for any lower class than his own, his failure to appreciate the situation that some people couldn't simply drive their car and leave to their vacation homes seems to astound such an egalitarian as Bush.  What New Orleans exemplifies is a class divide that has existed since the nascent of this nation that made blacks 3/5 a person without 3/5 of any rights.  As a result, the black population has been left at a lower economic social class, even after gaining equal rights as of 1863, they suffered he indignity of decisions of Plessy that allowed Jim Crow laws to exist for over a hundred more years.    \n\nHe also has a tenative view on immigration,  or hispanics, being not a 'true conservative' but a new age business conservative, President Bush fails conservative ideology as budget, programs and socialistic aspects of his administration which does not provide welfare for individuals but businesses.  i.e. airlines, car manufacturers, energy companies that were given billions of taxpayer dollars instead of the laissez faire capitalism he professes with regulation aspects.  He allows immigrants a free pass into the US as a way to undervalue the amount of American labor without any system of nationalization to his invisible hand market approach that increases the labor pool while devaluing the labor class and increases in inflation relative to job salary compensation.  \n\nIn essense, whatever is mathematically more solvent is what he will do, though this calculation doesn't reflect the American budget but rather the fact that the US has tripled in billionaires since 2000 yet overall compensation of jobs has fell and jobs themselves dissolve.  Bush by no extent is racist, just ignorant.	Politics & Government

I have a huge bruise on my leg but Im scared to go to the police cas its already been this long they wont do anything, then he'll just laugh at me and tell me how stupid i am again.Call somebody who cares he told me when i  called last [SEP] best_answer: As long as you still have the marks, make a police report! This man (for lack of a better word) is trying to control you, and sounds like he has succeeded up to this point! Don't be afraid of him, because you can be protected!! You don't have to put up with abuse from anyone! If he's into crack and has another woman, you should just hold your head high, and walk away from a bad situation. It'll only get worse if you let it! When you make your police report, you can also request a restraining order. In my town, you'd be directed to contact Victims Assistance, and they will have the restraining order for you as quickly as tomorrow! Don't let him get away with anything! He needs to be locked up!

question_title: How would you protest leagally and not get in trouble wit anyone? [SEP] question_content: cuz i want 2 [SEP] best_answer: Begin by reading two well-written books by Saul Alinsky - RULES FOR RADICALS and REVEILLE FOR RADICALS.\n\nClick on link below and scroll down to those titles, if you cannot find these books in the library.\n\nThe US Constitution grants us the right to peaceful assembly.  Most towns require organizers of any event, whether it's social or political, to get a permit.  This is usually to help the town deal with traffic, garbage pickup and other event-related realities.\n\nWhat you need to do is be clear on your issue and have a clear plan - are you protesting solo, like Cindy Sheehan? Or do you plan to organize a group?  \n\nWhat you do, where you do it and who you want to convince makes a difference.\n\nWhen our neighborhood was struggling to get the town to turn abandoned land into a town park, my neighbor and I called up every one of our neighbors to ask them to come to the town board meeting.  \n\n80 people showed up and we got our town park - many officials were against this because they didn't want tax dollars to go to that park, but because a lot of people showed up - those officials had to give in to the will of the people.

If you don't want to be here in America and don't like our laws, then go back to where ever you come from. I support tighter security on the border and illegal's should all be shipped away! Our jobs are being lost to these people because employers would rather pay Jose $5 hr than paying Mark $8 hr. They don't pay taxes and get free stuff from the government all the time. Born american! Buy american! Who's with me? \n\nAdditional Details\n\nApr 28, 2006 at 6:21 am\nI never said anything about legal immigrants. I saw the flyer stating that there needs to be less security on the border and what not. That is BS! Lots of countries suffer from poverty. Sorry about ya, we have our own poor to take care of! Illegal aliens is what my problem is! Coming over here and expecting me to learn your language?? No, you need to learn mine and speak English. We are an English speaking country! And for those wondering...I do have native american in me. So let's not get started on that! I also have dated a mexican, but he was born here and was LEGAL! Oh yeah, he spoke English too!\n\nApr 28, 2006 at 6:26 am\nWell, it's so nice to know that so many people want Illegal citizens here! Way to be proud of what you have...and become a minority! Glad to know that you want America overpopulated with non-english speaking people. Who don't pay for a damn thing in this country, but ship money back to their homeland to support families there! I have a feeling...i'm not the ignorant one...but the realistic one! [SEP] best_answer: I completely agree with you on everything!  My grandparents had to learn English when they came here, so did all the other immigrants that came at the time they did.  So why shouldn't the Spanish speaking immigrants have to learn it?  Are they too stupid?  Or too arrogant?  Maybe someone else is happy to have their taxes go to some lady that waddled across the border, had her baby here, and now collects welfare "for the baby" but I am not.  I say if they want to be here, go through the legal process, learn the language, and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of us.\n\nAnd oh yeah - while you like in the US, you fly the US flag.  That's another thing - they claim they are so oppressed where they are from, yet they want to wave the flag of where they re from and be "loyal" to where they came from - well they should be loyal to the country that gives them the things their own country won't!

question_title: This is an immigrant nation? [SEP] question_content: arent we all immigrants here, hell, the native americans should more right than most of us here. [SEP] best_answer: NO!!\nOMG!! S.O.S.!!(same old $h*t) The dinosaurs were here then the prehistoric man walked across the Bering Straits during the last Ice Age (15,000 to 30,000 years ago)and became the oldest KNOWN inhabitants of the North American continent. The Europeans came, saw and conquered the Native Americans (cruelly and unjustly). There were no laws on immigration at that time.  The Europeans formed a government, voted, elected leaders, passed laws, built this country from a wilderness. Those people passed a law later on immigration. That law says you must enter by legal means. Documents must be filed, legally processed, they must pass citizenship tests and be sworn in under oath before a person can be a citizen. It is an expensive, time consuming process. It is that way for a reason. People must be screened, their criminal records checked, medically checked for disease.\n\nI am a Native American. See that word "AMERICAN". That means I am a citizen of the USA. I am a natural born citizen. Those people who's ancestors came here are natural born citizens, too. They are NOT immigrants. You might be, but they aren't. Immigrants are people who were not born citizens. They are from another country. If they become citizens and have children here, their children are NATURAL BORN CITIZENS, not immigrants, either. Immigrants have been welcome in the USA. But our country can not take 800,000 immigrants every year and have the resources to sustain that many people. We must reduce immigration of all kinds back to 200,000 people per year or this country will be another third world nation by 2050. I don't think even the illegals would like that.

question_title: are there any republicans making less then 80,000 dollars a year.? [SEP] question_content: i have trouble beleifing americans who make less then 500,000  could be republicans at all.  what benefit do you get out of it you will never end   ;abortion , homosexuality ,promiscuity, drugs ,or pornography and bad rap songs.THOSE things are never going to end .why do you continue to make america suffer under profteers who only take your ability to move out of those conditions and raise a family in a respectable neighbor hood and scholl away from things you do not like and accept they have been around for 5000 years and are not going away.\nINSTEAD of demanding better pay you fight about trival moral issues that do not affect you if the meer knowledge of homosexuality offends you should they not be killed  in fact all people that have a different view .the biblee had a lot of stonings and things never changed. please consider a tax increase on the wealthiest 10% and a capital gains tax increase proportional to a graduated income tax up to 80% [SEP] best_answer: I am a republican, and make less than 80K a year. I used to make more, but 9-11 happened and my dream job ceased to exist. However, I became a republican because the platform of the party more closely reflected my personal, professional and political beliefs. I NEVER vote a straight party ticket, and always try to vote for the candidate I feel is the most qualified. In order to determine the qualifications of each candidate, I visit their websites, listen to political ads, watch debates and read profiles in the local paper. I try to be as informed about each candidate and their political stance on each issue before I determine whom to vote for. I have voted for democrats several times including in two presidential elections (Clinton).\n\nI regularly write my senators and representatives, both at state and federal level, in order to express my approval or disgust over their actions. I then vote my approval or dissatisfaction during the election. Most recently, I helped vote a republican mayor out of office because he was out of touch with the local citizens and was no longer a benefit to the community.\n\nI do not understand why you feel it is appropriate to take a fatalistic view of the world and decide certain "things are never going to end." I believe things can change if people want them to, particularly if a large group of people make a collective statement.\n\nI do not know anyone personally who advocates the eradication of wholesale segments of the population because of religious or sexual preference. \n\nI support proportional tax rates, to a point. No one should have to pay 80% on capital gains. There would be no incentive to earn money. Why would anyone invest $1 only to receive an additional 20 cents, regardless of how hard it was to make the 2nd dollar? You would bring the capitalist system to a halt.\n\nRepublicans normally support sound fiscal policy and the elimination or reduction of taxes. This is not always the case, as evidenced by some of the current administration's actions. You can't decry social inequity and then ask those who are the most industrious members of society to accept a system that forces them to work harder for less money because you want to give their hard earned money to people who aren't willing to work as hard.

question_title: U.S. Army? [SEP] question_content: What would you do if you could have your way with the U.S. Army? [SEP] best_answer: I would increase the budget so Soldiers could go to schools (Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, etc.), soldiers love schools and lately no one wants to give anyone up to go to school if it is not required for his job.\n\nLet people do what they want.  Too many branches (like infantry, MP, Armor) will not let anyone change branch to what they want but that same Soldiers time is up and they can get out, that's a good way to keep people!  Also for everyone who can't stand his job their is someone who wanted that job.  When they asked me what I wanted last year I said "If you can get me working with Iraqis I will do 2 years in Iraq" Well they sent me to Atlanta and now they can't pay people to go on these Iraqi training teams.  I think the only way to fix this is to set up an army message board so Soldiers can trade assignments when they are coming out.\n\nGet rid of all the useless slots in echelons above reality.\nMy current unit in Kuwait probably hurts the war effort by wasting manpower in a HQ building that does little if any real work and it counts as a deployed tour.  I would cut every sections personnel in half and move as much of the work back to the states as possible so at least people could be getting their stabilization while in this lame job.

question_title: Should I get a lawyer for my upcoming trial date? [SEP] question_content: I have a court date for November 16th for driving an uninsured vehicle. I got into an accident with a car i bought from an auction but no one else was envolved. I missed my last trial date and they put a warrant out for me. Eventually they caught up to me and threw me in jail for 3 days for contempt of court. November 16th is my rescheduled trail date. I am so broke and was wondering do you still think it was be a good idea to get a lawyer? [SEP] best_answer: Your story is a bit confusing, but, I'll answer based on my personal experience. It is rarely a "bad" idea to have proper legal representation when going into court. Most people are simply not qualified to fully understand court proceedings well enough to competently represent themselves. There is also the emotional factor, which can hinder a person from representing themselves in a concise manner. \n\nMy personal experience with this scenario was a real eye-opener. I naively believed that the judge would be patient and helpful as I struggled to make myself heard. I was wrong. The courts are so overloaded, that most judges have an enormous case load to get through on any given day - and they want to keep things moving along at breakneck speed. They want to hear legal language and concepts, not layperson "stammerings".\n\nYou say you are "so broke", so, I don't understand how you can possibly afford a private practice attorney, especially at this late date. Most private practice attorneys - at least the ones who are worth anything - are so busy that they can't take on new cases on such short notice - and certainly not without a sizeable retainer. Your best bet - and maybe your only one - is to contact Legal Aid in your area and request as quick an appointment as they can give you. You'll have to fill out a bunch of financial forms to see if you even qualify, based on their guidelines. Be prepared with things like paystubs and all court documents.  If they do agree to represent you, take the help. At the very least, you'll receive informed legal advice, which, unless you are a pre-law student, would be pretty tough to come by on your own.\n\n Remember to dress appropriately for court, be incredibly respectful to the Judge, behave with remorse, and, for the most part, unless spoken to directly by the Judge - keep your mouth shut. I made the stupid mistake of letting my emotions get away from me, and, in one instance of speaking while the Judge was speaking, I lost everything. Maybe some judges are tolerant, but, my experience has been that most are not. Good luck to you.	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One is born with dyslexia. \n\nShe did not discover exactly what it was until a grownup, but she always had it. Here is what she says:\n\nWhen did you find out you were dyslexic? \n\nWhen I was a grown woman\n\n"When I was a kid they didn't call it dyslexia. They called it... you know, you were slow, or you were retarded, or whatever. And so, I learned from a guy who was running a program who I met one day and he had written out on a board a sentence. And I said to him, "You know, I can't read that." And he said, "Why not"? And I said, "Because it doesn't make any sense to me." So he said, "Well, write down what you see under each. Whatever you see, write exactly what you see underneath." And so, he brought me to letters by coordinating what I saw to something called an A, or a B, or a C, or a D, and that was pretty cool."

question_title: Sexual effects of aging? [SEP] question_content: I am 45 years old and still get erect easily enough, but when I have sex it only lasts for like less than a minute. I know its not impotence because I get fully erect, but it seems it has become more sensitive and I end too quick. I did ask my Doctor and he said this was normal with aging but I thought it took longer when you get older not shorter. I never had a problem with pre-mature ejaculation, so whats the deal ? Anyone else know what Im talking about ? [SEP] best_answer: I'm 43 and i found that i lasted longer because i'm more in tune with my body. It helps to be with the right partner someone you have feelings for. I can't just have proper sex with people i don't really know anymore.

The calmer and peaseful my life is, the better my sex life is. I hope this helps you and good luck.	Health

This can take from one to a number of attempts to get it out depending how far in it goes.Sometimes I find too if I tip my head sideways (again on the side with water in) and push the palm of my hand up and down fully across my ear this can sometimes suction it out!  \n\nWhether either of these are medically acceptable I have no idea but after over 25 years as a swimmer it works for me.

question_title: How do you cure a cold or flu or fever? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: All three of these are different... Here are my recommendations: \n\nCold: \nAs mentioned above, folklore tells us that we should feed a cold. Experience has taught me that the best thing to feed a cold is usually chicken soup. It doesn't have to be homemade - even Campbell's will work - but homemade does seem to be best. Keep up the fluids - drink water, hot tea, ginger ale, anything to keep hydrated. Hot tea seems to work best for me. Take vitamin C, and zinc - you can get tablets at your local pharmacy, or a multivitamin will do in a pinch. Get plenty of rest, too. If your head is stuffed up or you're congested in any way, prop yourself up a little bit on a couple of pillows so that you sleep with your head higher than your chest. Doesn't have to be a lot, just a little will do the trick. And if you can, sleep on your back this way. Don't know why, but it seems to help with the drainage of all that mucus. \n\nFever: \nAgain, referencing the folklore, starve a fever. If you've got a fever, you probably don't feel like eating anyway. Fevers you have to keep a closer eye on. I've always felt like they're more dangerous than a cold. Anyway, again, stay hydrated - drink water, iced tea, ginger ale - you're probably not going to want anything hot. As a rule of thumb, if you get hungry, eat something. Try something light at first to make sure...a piece of dry toast or some crackers. Take your tempreture whenever you think of it to make sure you're not boiling over. If your tempreture gets too high, go to a doctor. \n\nFlu: \nStay warm, and stay close to a bathroom for starters! Stay hydrated - gatorade, tea, water, ginger ale is great. There's something about ginger that helps settle my stomach, so ginger ale and ginger tea (if you like either) are usually good to have around. Get as much rest as you can. Do whatever you can to stay comfortable. Peptobismal has always been a wonder drug in my family... Immodium for diareaha (sp?) is really good, too. Again, chicken soup if you can keep it down. Don't know what it is about that chicken soup, but it does seem to help.	Health

question_title: How do I treat my swollen gums? [SEP] question_content: I have braces so brushing is not very effective anymore, and my gums are all swollen up. However, I floss (like the orthodontist told me to) and soak my mouth with peroxide (I heard it helps to get rid of bacteria), but my gums are still swollen. \nAny advice? [SEP] best_answer: Did the orthodontist give you any proxabrushes?  They look like little Christmas tree shaped bristles.  These work great to get all the plaque out from around the brackets.   Also using an electric toothbrush (like a Sonicare) helps massage the gums and remove plaque.  Some of the inflammation could be from moving the teeth, if you had a lot of spacing and the teeth are moving closer.  But usually it comes down to not removing all the bacteria.  Ortho requires meticulous oral hygiene.  I am sure I dont hae to tell you that all kinds of stuff gets caught around the brackets!!  \nI wouldnt rinse with peroxide for very long, long term usage can actually harm the tissue.  Instead ask your dentist or orthodontist if they can give you a RX fro PerioGard, or if they have it available to purchase in office.  This rinse kills bacteria better than any over the counter rinse.  If you dont want to use that rinse try Breath Rx rinse or the new Crest Pro Health rinse.  I would stay away from Listerine because it contains a lot of alcohol which actually dries the tissue.\nInterested if you are experiencing a lot of bleeding along with the swollen gums.  This is the telltale sign that it is due to bacteria and plaque more than movement of the teeth.\nKey is brush, floss, proxabrush, rinse.  Also try a waterpik that flushes bacteria and debris from around the brackets and gums.  \nGood Luck, remember it will be over eventually and then you will appreciate how much easier it is to clean your teeth without all that stuff!!

question_title: Vasectomy Reversal? [SEP] question_content: Does it really work ?  Is there anyone out there that had a Vasectomy Reversal and worked for them ? [SEP] best_answer: A vasectomy is done to be a permanent thing.  Since I'm not qualified to give advice in this manner, here is some info I'm sure you will find useful..\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2925082881023986001&q=vasectomy\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasectomy/HQ01049\nVasectomy: The right form of birth control for you?\nVasectomy provides a permanent form of birth control for men. Is it right for you? \nVasectomy is a surgical procedure that permanently makes a man unable to father a child (sterile). It involves severing and sealing the two tubes (vasa deferentia) that carry sperm from your testicles to your seminal fluid (semen). After the procedure, your semen will not contain sperm, so when you ejaculate during sexual intercourse, you'll be unable to get a woman pregnant.\nWorldwide, about 50 million men have had a vasectomy. Each year, approximately 500,000 American men undergo the procedure. More American married couples rely on it for family planning than on any other method except female sterilization (tubal ligation) and birth control pills (oral contraceptives). Because a vasectomy often can't be reversed, you need to carefully consider the pros and cons before choosing it.\nWho is it for?\nMost men who seek vasectomies have been married for at least 10 years. If you're considering a vasectomy, it's essential that you and your partner both want a permanent form of birth control. Vasectomy may be an option if:\n·You and your partner agree that you have all the children you want\n·You and your partner are unable or unwilling to use another birth control method\n·Your partner has a health condition that makes pregnancy unsafe\nYou may want to forgo vasectomy if you're:\n·Unsure about having children in the future\n·In an unstable relationship\n·Motivated primarily by a desire to please your partner\n·Young, with many life changes ahead\n·Single, divorced or separated\n·Counting on having children later by having the vasectomy reversed or freezing your sperm\nIt's not uncommon for men to consider vasectomy in response to a stressful situation such as an illness, financial setback, death in the family or birth of a child. Because the stress may be temporary, however, it's better to seek counseling or psychotherapy to help you cope than to undergo a surgical procedure you may later regret.\nBefore deciding on a vasectomy, you and your partner should consider its long-term implications. Ask yourself how you'd feel if you had a vasectomy and:\n·One of your children died\n·Your financial situation improved so that you could afford another child\n·You and your partner separated or divorced, or your partner died\nHow do you prepare?\nDoctors usually perform vasectomies in an office or family planning clinic. The cost ranges from $150 to $1,200, about one-quarter of the expense of the more complicated tubal ligation surgery used for female sterilization. Most insurance policies cover at least some of the cost.\nAfter choosing a doctor, meet with him or her to discuss the procedure, risks and potential complications. It's best to include your partner in this initial consultation.\nIf you're worried that a vasectomy might somehow make you less of a man, now is the time to bring up such concerns. Your doctor can reassure you that sterility won't affect your virility. Because the testicles continue to produce the same amount of the male sex hormone testosterone after a vasectomy, the procedure should have no effect on your sex drive or your ability to get an erection. A vasectomy will not affect your body composition and other male characteristics. You'll still have the same muscle mass, facial hair and voice. Nor should a vasectomy noticeably reduce the volume of your ejaculate, since semen consists almost entirely of fluids produced by the prostate and other glands.\nTwo weeks before and after your vasectomy, don't take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motr	Health

question_title: Why am I having such a hard time starting a diet? [SEP] question_content: Eveyday I plan to "start fresh" with a diet/exercise routine and it doesn't happen! Now I am feeling that with the holidays coming up, I should just wait until after the holidays to start but that is what happened last year! What would be some of the psychological issues to not being able to start a diet? [SEP] best_answer: Hmm...sounds like you aren't ready for a huge change.  That's OK.  It's scary to start something dramatic, especially if you know that you're going to have to maintain a new lifestyle if you want to change forever, which essentially means the first day of your diet is the first day of the rest of your life.  That's daunting.  And you probably figure you can't do it, so you might as well not do anything.  Pretty typical response, I've even suffered with it myself.  Sometimes I basically feel like, "oh, I've cheated once, I've ruined everything, I might as well go eat a cheeseburger."  hehe. :)  \n\nAnyways, for you, I'd recommend starting small.  Just start making an effort to do something so easy, that you know you'll be able to do it.  This could be as easy as making and effort to work out for 30 mins or an hour just one day a week, and making an effort to eat just a couple healthy meals per week, and not sweating the rest of the meals.  Once you've done that for awhile and you've accepted it as a part of your routine, add another exercise day, more healthy meals, etc.  Keep transitioning slowly until you've gotten to at least 4 days of exercise and mostly healthy meals every week. \n\nDoing it like this is NOT going to cause a dramatic change in your body very quickly.  It's going to be slow and you should not expect a lot of weight or inches to be lost like this.  But, several studies have proven that weight that is lost more slowly has a better chance of being kept off for the rest of your life.\n\nMake sure that whatever life change you want, that you can live with it.  A diet is useless if you hate every minute of it.	Health
question_title: Can multiple sclerosis affect your heart, as in a AV Block(3rd degree)? [SEP] question_content: Has ms ever been misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia? How can they test for MS if you have a cardiac pacemaker, that functions for 98% of the ventricular beats? [SEP] best_answer: MS shouldn't cause heart block, but something that can cause symptoms like MS and fibromyagia and cause heart block is Lyme disease.  If yo haven't been checked you may want to have Lyme disease tests done.  There are several different tests and there are frequent false negatives, especially if you are having widespread symptoms.

question_title: Grammar OCD? [SEP] question_content: I was wondering if it's possible to have a grammar OCD? I have no idea if I'm obsessed or obsessed to the point of OCD. When I'm sitting in a lecture, if there's a misuse of something such as their/there on the powerpoint slide, I'll stop listening and focus on that and try to distract myself, except usually that causes me to think about other similar mistakes that people have made around me recently. By the time I'm remotely focused again I've missed a chunk of the lecture.\n\nNow for example, I just had a massive argument with an American friend over the common misuse of lay/lie and I couldn't just stop and shut up, or back off. It frustrates me and stresses me out to the point that until I started typing I was alternately tapping my pen repeatedly on the desk and tugging on my clothing. Most of the time I try to keep my mouth shut but it doesn't usually work. \n\nSometimes I'll refuse to watch a movie/listen to music if it has bad grammar!\n\nCould that be an OCD or am I just obssessed? [SEP] best_answer: Well... There is no such this as AN OCD. There is such thing as OCD. I have OCD, and a thing about grammar. OCD should be looked at as one big disorder, not little quirks here and there. If you have more things like this, for instance the arrangement of your room, then you could look at symptoms for OCD. I think this would be a quirk.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Muscle mechanics\nThe gluteus maximus, the large muscle in your buttocks, works together with the two muscles on your outer hip, called your hip abductors. The hip abductors are the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. Attached to your pelvis and the top of your thighbone, the gluteus medius - with the assistance of your gluteus minimus, located under it - moves your leg out, away from the center of your body.

question_title: does anybody have a pair of mbt trainers and if so do they work? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Shoes with this 'rocker' shape make the muscles in your legs work differently, and it can be useful, but only if you use your foot correctly in the first place. Similar shapes have been tried in running shoes now and then, but the more gradual 'footstrike' uses up energy and slows the runner down.\n\n(that's actually beneficial; it makes you work harder and protects you from injury, but most runners will sacrifice safety and long-term health if it makes them faster!)\n\nLots of people try to run only on the ball and toe of their foot; if you do this, then the rocker shape could make your foot roll forward faster than you're used to (leading to injury).\n\nFell Running (running in moorland & rough countryside) is very good for your leg muscles and joints. That's because your foot placement varies all the time, so the different muscles all learn to support each other, instead of constantly operating in the same sequence as they do when you run on a smooth surface. \n\nTypically, a Fell Running shoe is LESS padded and curved than a normal road shoe. This allows the runner to FEEL the surface better, and adapt to it more easily. In this type of running, the foot might be placed on the ground in a totally different position for EVERY STEP. These variations teach the leg muscles to cooperate very effectively.\n\nIf you slow down your usual running, and try to run in different 'styles' (the categories are designed to sell more shoes, not help your running), you will improve the way your leg muscles co-operate. \n\nIf you buy more than one pair of running shoes, try to get contrasting styles (eg a pair for over- & a pair for under-pronation, or a heavy pair and a lightweight pair) and use them alternately, carefully adapting your style to each. Don't run too fast (if you do, you're likely to revert to your usual habit, and you'll lose the benefit), and try to 'roll' your foot onto the ground, so that it makes little or no sound. \n\nYou can try running slightly toe-out and slightly toe-in, as well. You'll notice that this feels different in each 'style' of shoe, because your foot position encourages you to pronate differently too.\n\n(Running fairly slowly and quietly, with an exaggerated heel-and-toe action and slightly higher knee-lift, should replicate any benefits the 'rocker' shoe can give you) \n\nThese drills will activate the muscles around your calf and shin differently, as well as some of the muscles in your thigh, making you a more versatile runner, and defending your knee, ankle and hip from accumulating damage.\n\nIMPORTANT : while you're not used to the drills, you're vulnerable to overuse damage in muscles you've been neglecting. Introduce the drills gradually, and reduce your session mileage AND your overall mileage until you're very comfortable with each drill.	Health

question_title: what are good remedies for the stomach flu? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What is stomach flu? \nStomach flu is a viral infection that affects the stomach and small intestine.  It is also called viral gastroenteritis.  The illness is usually brief, lasting 1 to 3 days. \nHow does it occur? \nGastroenteritis is caused by swallowing certain viruses.  The body fluids of infected people contain the virus, sometimes even before their symptoms begin.  The virus can be spread by direct contact with an infected person (for example, kissing or shaking hands) or by sharing food, drink, or eating utensils. \n\nThe virus enters the stomach and intestine and inflames the lining of these organs.  As a result, the stomach and intestine are temporarily unable to perform their usual functions.  The virus can also cause food to move more rapidly through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. \n\nSome bacteria and other tiny organisms called protozoa can cause infections that have symptoms similar to those of stomach flu. \n\nWhat are the symptoms? \nWhen you have stomach flu, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: \n\n• fatigue \n• chills \n• loss of appetite \n• nausea \n• vomiting \n• stomach cramps \n• diarrhea \n• low-grade fever \n• muscle aches.\nThe illness may develop over a period of hours, or it may suddenly start with stomach cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea. \nHow is it diagnosed? \nYour health care provider will review your symptoms.  He or she may examine you and order lab tests to rule out more serious illnesses, such as appendicitis, and to detect complications, such as dehydration. \n\nHow is it treated? \nThe most important thing to do is to rest the stomach and intestines.  You can do this by first eating nothing and drinking only clear liquids.  A little later you can eat soft bland foods that are easy to digest. \n\nDuring the vomiting phase of the illness it is best to have only small, frequent sips of liquids. \nDrinking too much at once, even an ounce or two, may cause more vomiting. \n\nYour choice of liquids is important.  If water is the only liquid you can drink without vomiting, that is okay.  However, if you have been vomiting frequently for a long time, you must replace the minerals, sodium and potassium, that are lost when you vomit.  Ask your health care provider what sport drinks or medical products could help you replace these minerals. \n\nOther clear liquids you can drink are weak tea and apple juice.  You may also drink soft drinks without caffeine (such as 7 UP) after letting them lose some of their carbonation (go flat).  Chilling the liquids may help you keep them down.  Avoid liquids that are acidic (such as orange juice) or caffeinated (such as coffee) or have a lot of carbonation.  Do not drink milk until you no longer have diarrhea. \n\nYou may start eating soft bland foods when you have not vomited for several hours and are able to drink clear liquids without further upset.  Soda crackers, toast, noodles, applesauce, and bananas are good first choices.  Avoid foods that are acidic, spicy, fatty, or fibrous (meats, coarse grains, vegetables) and dairy products.  You may start eating these foods again in 3 days or so, when all signs of illness have passed. \n\nSometimes treatment includes prescription medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting or diarrhea.  Nonprescription medicine is available for the treatment of diarrhea and is very effective.  If you use it, make sure you use the dose recommended on the package.  Before you use any medicine \nfor diarrhea, always check with your health care provider first. \n\nIf you have been vomiting for more than a day or have had diarrhea for over 3 days, call your health care provider.  You may need to have a physical exam to rule out more serious problems and to check for dehydration.  You may also need to have lab tests to determine whether bacteria or protozoa are causing your illness. \n\nDehydration is a potentially serious complication of stomach flu.  It can occur if your body loses too much fluid because	Health

question_title: what is a placebo effect? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's the effect that people get when they believe they should get one.\n\nBasically, it comes from the expectation that something good should happen.  \n\nThere was an experiment once, where they wanted to determine if the level of light over the work area could effect production.  They went into the area and changed the light bulbs to a higher wattage.  Work production increased.  Ahha! they thought.  Higher light increases production.  Then they went in and changed the light bulbs back to the original ones.  You might think that production dropped, but in fact it increased again.\n\nThe people were reacting to the attention they were getting.  The feeling that someone was paying attention to them increased their production.\n\nSo, the placebo effect is one that we perceive someone is concerned about us, and the "medication" we are getting should make us feel better.  And it often does, even if there is no medication in the pill.  \n\nA company researching a new medication would want to give a placebo to a group of people they were testing to ensure that it was their medication and not the "placebo effect" that was causing the improvement.

If you knew how much agony you would be in during surgery, you may not choose to have surgery in the future when you really need it.

[SEP] best_answer: I know how bad you must be hurting- so found this info for you.... hope it helps/..\n\n\nCanker sores are shallow, painful sores in your mouth. They are usually red or may sometimes have a white coating over them. You might get them on the inside of your lips, the insides of your cheeks, the base of your gums or under your tongue. Canker sores are different from fever blisters, which usually are on the outside of your lips or the corners of your mouth.\n\nAnyone can get canker sores, but women people in their teens and 20s get them more often. Canker sores may run in families, but they aren't contagious. Doctors don't know what causes canker sores, but they may be triggered by stress, poor nutrition, food allergies and menstrual periods.\n\nCanker sores usually go away without any treatment. For pain relief, you can try taking ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) or acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol). Other medicines, such as Anbesol, Oragel, Orabase and Zilactin-B, might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating, drinking or brushing your teeth. You put these medicines right on the sore.\n\nYou can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid. After it's mixed, you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out. If you do this every 4 to 6 hours, your canker sores may hurt less.\n\nSome people think that sucking on zinc lozenges, taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex, using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster.

question_title: What do you know about a new medicine (drug) for autism discovered in Australia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Beware of any treatment called a 'miracle cure'... Autism is such a pervasive disorder, that a single drug is unlikely to ever 'cure it'. It may be that some of the symptoms may be reduced, but considering that autism affects the development of a child's brain, it is unlikely that anything (in the near future) will be able to 'undo' developmental pathogenenes. \n\nThis article shows the current state of mind concerning 'miracle drugs'\n\nNovel treatments for autistic spectrum disorders.\n\nLevy SE, Hyman SL.\n\nChildren's Seashore House, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, 1914, USA. Levys@email.chop.edu\n\nIn no area of developmental pediatric practice is there more controversy regarding the choice of treatment than related to children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM) are often elected because they are perceived as treating the cause of symptoms rather than the symptoms themselves. CAM used for autism can be divided by proposed mechanism: immune modulation, gastrointestinal, supplements that affect neurotransmitter function, and nonbiologic intervention. Secretin as a therapy for autism is discussed as an example of how a clinical observation rapidly grew to a widespread treatment before well-designed studies demonstrated absence of effect. The plausibility for behavioral effect was not substantiated by clinical studies. CAM used for treatment of autism is examined in terms of rationale, evidence of efficacy, side effects, and additional commentary. Families and clinicians need access to well-designed clinical evidence to assist them in choice of therapies. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nHere's another article that may interest you:\n\nAutism, an extreme challenge to integrative medicine. Part 2: medical management.\n\nKidd PM.\n\nAutism and allied autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) present myriad behavioral, clinical, and biochemical abnormalities. Parental participation, advanced testing protocols, and eclectic treatment strategies have driven progress toward cure. Behavioral modification and structured education are beneficial but insufficient. Dietary restrictions, including removal of milk and other casein dairy products, wheat and other gluten sources, sugar, chocolate, preservatives, and food coloring are beneficial and prerequisite to benefit from other interventions. Individualized IgG or IgE testing can identify other troublesome foods but not non-immune mediated food sensitivities. Gastrointestinal improvement rests on controlling Candida and other parasites, and using probiotic bacteria and nutrients to correct dysbiosis and decrease gut permeability. Detoxification of mercury and other heavy metals by DMSA/DMPS chelation can have marked benefit. Documented sulfoxidation-sulfation inadequacies call for sulfur-sulfhydryl repletion and other liver p450 support. Many nutrient supplements are beneficial and well tolerated, including dimethylglycine (DMG) and a combination of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and magnesium, both of which benefit roughly half of ASD cases. Vitamins A, B3, C, and folic acid; the minerals calcium and zinc; cod liver oil; and digestive enzymes, all offer benefit. Secretin, a triggering factor for digestion, is presently under investigation. Immune therapies (pentoxifyllin, intravenous immunoglobulin, transfer factor, and colostrum) benefit selected cases. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids offer great promise. Current pharmaceuticals fail to benefit the primary symptoms and can have marked adverse effects. Individualized, in-depth clinical and laboratory assessments and integrative parent-physician-scientist cooperation are the keys to successful ASD management.\n\n\nConcerning chelation therapy, although it may well be effective in some cases, it has some serious risks: one boy died during threatment: http://www.post-gazette.co	Health

I don't push my service onto others I give out cards and flyers and offer discount prices to introduce my touch, but thats about it. What else can I do to attract potential clients? Thanks in advance! [SEP] best_answer: As long as you're licensed in the state in which you are seeking clients (some people aren't), I would recommend checking with chiropractors and at figure salons. Give free talks about massage to the Optomists, Rotary club and Chamber of Commerse. Also, put an ad in the paper offering discounts for multiple massages, or couples. Write an article about massage and offer it as filler to the local paper. Offer massage at all the senior citizen places. (Remember, seniors are more delicate, so you have to go easy.)Lots of massage therapists make a wonderful living by specializing in massaging seniors. My Dad's masseuse got Christmas bonuses from her clients adding up into the thousands. She was really terrific. She was the only one of his caregivers that he remembered in his will. Do you know what she did with the money? She sent flowers to his children and his sister. You could be as beloved as our Marnny. She works 30 hours a week massaging seniors and makes a good 60K+ per year. Use your imagination. There are probably hundreds of other ways to promote your  business. Have you thought about donating a massage to a fundraiser in exchange for the names and phone numbers of the people who entered the drawing? Do you offer "M"bucks for referrals? (That's massage bucks, good for application toward a massage.) How about offering coupon books as gifts for friends and relatives? You could make a killing around this time of the year, because what do you get the guy who has everything?? Have you spoken to Human Resources Directors at local stress-inducing businesses? What a wonderful benefit to receive as a reward for a job well done! You could wind up with more business than you can handle! (That's when you raise your prices and hire help!) If you have a portable massage chair, what about traveling massages for executives? That's just a few ideas. I hope you do well in your search for clients!	Business & Finance

question_title: Is there laws about a boss that curses you and is verbally abusive? I resently quit a job i loved because of 1 [SEP] question_content: I had been working at this place for 12 years and loved what I did, then they hired this new lady boss she seem to hate me and made my life a nightmare, the day after she got there I over heard her talking bad about me while I was in the restroom and she didn't know that I could hear her, when I ask her about it she told me that it was none of my Da-- business and suspended me refusing to even let me get a piece of paper off of my desk.  I did nothing wrong.  When I reported her to her boss he came and said he talked to others who worked there and no one else had a problem with her which I know isn't true, but they were afraid for thier jobs.  The thing that makes this so heartbreaking is that this is a nursing home and she stated very clear she doesn;t do the family thing and she hates children. I worry about all the little residents that I love. [SEP] best_answer: You should look into the ethics standards section(s) of the Joint Commission agency, this agency regulates almost every aspect of a health care facility and there practices. Also you can get OSHA involved, this agency also deals with the health care but only in the "safety"  aspect. I have learned that the word safety also implies not only to hazardous materials and situations but to safety in the "work environment" in that a coworker can conduct themselves in a threatening way (as to) and there by creating an unsafe working environment. This is not a word play, it is a fact. you should look into this.	Business & Finance

question_title: how long do you have to keep inactive employee files? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Many in business have asked the title question, often in frustration. Even in this electronic age businesses run on paper; consider how much information exists both electronically and in hard copy. Paper, which we seem to have in excess in business, will be with us for some time. And the piles keep getting taller and the files fuller. Can't we ever get rid of some of this?\n\nWe can partly conquer the paper plague. The problems lie in determining what must be retained and for how long and deciding how to get unnecessary material separated from the rest.\n\nThe employee records of interest to most businesses fall into two categories: the financial side of employment and all other employment documentation. The financial side is the more orderly; business owners find the most variation in record-keeping requirements among documents kept in personnel files. Some of the confusion arises from the fact that different Federal laws specify different retention periods for the same documents.\n\nFinancial Records\nCompensation records -- amounts and payment dates, straight time and overtime hours and pay, pension payments, benefits plan payments and other additions and deductions -- should be kept for four years. Affecting most employers, the four-year requirement is specified in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and Federal Unemployment Tax Act and by Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Equal Pay Act and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) designate some of these documents for three years' retention, but the longer period applies in practice. The Equal Pay Act and FLSA also require that daily work schedules, pay rates and weekly compensation be retained for three years; these are not addressed in the laws designating four years' retention. Likewise, tax records -- wages subject to withholding, taxes withheld and other tax information -- are subject to the four-year requirement.\n\nNon-financial Records\nAccording to FICA, Unemployment and Withholding, basic employee data -- name, address, gender, birth date, etc. -- must be retained four years. Personnel files are maintained for active employees, so this requirement is reasonably interpreted as needing to keep these records for four years following termination. One exception under FSLA, applicable to many small businesses, involves work permits for minors; these be retained until the employee leaves or reaches majority age.\n\nRecords of Actions\nRecords of actions such as promotions, demotions, transfers, layoffs, recalls, terminations and such must be kept for one year per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). But for all practical purposes these are part the personnel file for the duration of employment and longer.\n\nSafety and Health Records\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) mandates the longest retention periods. Records of exposure to toxic substances and blood-borne pathogens must be retained for the duration of employment plus 30 years. OSHA sometimes designates even longer periods for exposure to certain substances, and some states have "right-to-know" laws requiring retention of exposure records for the duration of employment plus 40 years. We can consider 4 years as the standard for compensation and tax information, but a personnel file can hold documents having legal retention periods of one to five years and 30 to 40 years after termination. There are about a dozen federal laws specifying these retention periods.\n\nAccumulated Records\nWhat to do about accumulated records? Simple for financial records: discard compensation and tax records after four years. Obvious? Perhaps, but one can sometimes be surprised upon discovering dusty caches of such records much older than four years.\n\nThe answer isn't as simple for documents held in personnel files. We have good reason to keep records of employment actions for the duration of e	Business & Finance

question_title: why is suicide so looked down upon? [SEP] question_content: I don't judge you for your choices, so why judge others for theirs? [SEP] best_answer: It would seem that what is meant by the term "looked down upon" would reflect the need of a proper angle into appraising such a question by the poser (addressing the question).\nSuicide is the taking of a life by the "self." \nIt seems that from a legal aspect the taking of any life is against the norm of explicit rule of law and this would be an action or inaction to prevent a murder, and thusly possible under our society's law. \nIt (the commission of the act itself) is also a terrible contingent upon the future of the surviving significant others.\nFrom another angle (spiritual) in many religions such an act is considered to be a crime (sin) against a creature of God; however not a condemnation.\nIn my opinion these views are not derogatory but on the contrary it is a reach by the 'social norm' to extend humane buttress unto an individual so inclined.

question_title: do you think its ideal to engage in a restaurant / bar & grill  business? [SEP] question_content: I am  single, young professional and with my exposures on business I can rate myself on the 3 level when the rating is 1 to 5 for experience. Now now, I wanted to gather some figures on whether I should go on and make a move for food business or have to eye another prospective project. I am passionate eating but havent got the cracks on cooking. I work for certain food chains before as a management trainee. Now I am working in a trading company... tell me your idea... I am most willing to listen. [SEP] best_answer: If you're looking to make your first venture into the business world as an owner, I suggest one of two things:\n\n1) Forget the food business, it's the most complicated industry out there. In no other industry are you expected to be a warehouse and a manufacturer, with parts that are perishable, be a retailer, run a delivery business, and sell service also.\n\n2) If you insist on the food business, especially with no experience, find a very, very well structured franchise to buy into. Forget the cost, it's a drop in the bucket when you weigh out the chances of success or failure compared to trying to build a concept from scratch.\n\nThe risks of getting involved in the food business are evidenced by the failure rate of restaurants. These failure rates don't even take into account all the country club, college and university food services that lose money every year and have to be subsidized by other departments. There are unsubstantiated rumors about the food industry that place failure rates as high as 90% in the first year. Though that is a gross exageration, the failure rate in the restaurant world is high, just ask your banker, accountant or lawyer. They deal with it every day. There's a reason restaurant loans are among the toughest to get approved for. According to a report in Restaurant Startup & Growth magazine, based on information gathered from the National Restaurant Association, it's estimated that around 57% of restaurants don't live past the five year mark. Of these, the main casualties are independent restaurants. While 7 of 10 independent restaurants will likely fail, 7 of 10 franchise restaurants will survive. As there are many, many people out there that don't realize the value that real structure will bring to their restaurant, and increase their chances of survival, the greater number of independent restaurants opening compared to franchise restaurants pushes the total restaurant failure rate to 57%.\n\nMost other businesses contain elements of only one or two different industries. With a simpler business, it is much easier to focus on marketing and growth than with a restaurant. Inside a restaurant, most your day is filled with operational procedures, and you CAN NOT work ON a business if you are working IN the business 60 hours or more a week.\n\nBrandon O'Dell\nO'Dell Consulting\nRestaurants/Retail/Bars\nwww.bodellconsulting.com	Business & Finance
question_title: On the job injury pay? [SEP] question_content: If a person has an on the job injury, is the employer required to pay the employee their full wage during time off due to the injury, in California? [SEP] best_answer: I have been a workers' comp. paralegal for 20 years - IN VIRGINIA.  Here you are entitled to 2/3 of your weekly pre-injry gross wages if you cannot work at all.  If you can work light duty and you have a wage loss, then you are entitled to 2/3rds of the difference between what you were making before you got hurt (average weekly wage gross) and what you are earning after the injury.  BUT-laws vary widely from state to state.  I'd go to Ask.Com and look up the California Workers' Compensation Commission or Industrial Commission.  All states have these websites and I'm sure the info. that applies to you is on there.  Good luck, and I hope you are better soon.	Business & Finance

question_title: When dealing with sound, you some times see RMS when it comes to wattage. What does RMS mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Great question.\n\nLiterally RMS means Root Mean Square, it is a simple way to take the average of a varying electrical signal.\n\nAs you know, a pure musical tone looks like the up and down pattern of waves when you drop a pebble in a calm pond. This shape is called a sine curve.\n\nSine curves vary from negative to positive values so if you add them up to take an average they would "cancel out".\n\nThe trick is to square (multiply by itself) each value before adding them. This turns all the negatives into postive values. No cancelling! Then you take the MEAN (the average). Then to get back to a "normal" number, you take the square root.\n\nThe problem is that in audio power, the average power in watts is really just a direct average of the actual power output. Since power is always positive, there is no need to use the RMS averaging method. Really you just sample the power for a while and average it the regular old fashioned way.\n\nHowever, because you can get a quick approximation of the power output of a system from the RMS value of the electrical current of a sine curve, marketers in order to make you feel awed have taken to calling audio power "RMS power". It is really just average power though and is a fairly meaningless measure of goodness. For instance you might have two systems with equal power, and one could sound like a dollar-store radio! LOL! but so true!\n\nThis is just marketing silliness. But it sounds good doesn't it?	Business & Finance

question_title: what is an infinite loop? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A non terminating infinite loop is usually considered an error.\n\nHowever there are some applications which are infinite loops on purpose. The are usually servers for event driven applications. Consider web servers. They loop infinitely until a request comes to them. They process the request and go back to their loop waiting for the next request.\n\nInfinite loops can be nasty, so early computer theorist wondered if there was a way to detect them. In fact certain problems could be solved if we could tell if a program went into an infinite loop or not.\n\nAlan Turing, one of the founders of computer science, provide the "halting problem." It answered the question, and he proved that one couldn't write a program which could determine if a general program contained an infinite loop or not.\n\nThe proof (by contradiction) goes along these lines.\n\nAssume program, P, exists, and it reads another program, p, and tests it for infinite loops. It exhibits the following behavior:\n\nP(p) prints "Halts" if p halts.\n\nP(p) prints "Does not halt" if p does not halt.\n\nPretty straight forward assumption... ok?\n\nNow, let's modify P to make a new program P', that does almost the same things as P, but just slightly different.\n\nP'(p) goes into an infinite loop itself if p halts.\n\nP'(p) halts if p goes into an infinite loop.\n\nBasically, P' does the opposite of p.\n\nSince P' works on any program, let's run the following:\n\nP'(P') - basically have P' test itself. What does it do?\n\nIf P' halts, then P' doesn't halt.\nIf P' doesn't halt, then P' halts.\n\nIt can't do something and not do that thing at the same time. It's a contradiction, which unravels back to the assumption that P can exist.\n\nTherefore P cannot exist.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How do format my system and not loose any data? [SEP] question_content: My system gets hung up frequently and I keep getting the blue screen sometimes.So I've decided to format my C: which is my main drive. I have a windows 98 SE currently installed. Don't have the install CD, but I have the whole windows 98 installation files in my D drive. I've got things like mp3, important documents & photos, MS Office, Visual Studio, Photoshop, etc on my main drive. Is there an easy way to format my system and re-install my current version of windows? [SEP] best_answer: No. There is no eay way. Perhaps the easiest is to simply buy another hard disk (if you can actually install one in your hardware) and install a fresh copy of the operating system on it, making it the a new c drive, but this raises some particular issues. Some applications (and many operating systems) require that certain files (configuration stuff, for instance) be on the same drive from which the system has booted (or on which the application is installed). So changing to a new drive like this will involve some obscure issues dependent on not so obvious details of how this or that program (including the operating system) was designed and implemented. \n\n==========\nThere are some things you'll have to think about here, before you do anything at all. I'll assume you aren't going to get a new hard disk, and discuss the problem as you laid it out. Namely, reformatting the existing C drive and reinstalling your system on it. \n\nDo you really need to reformat? You may be able to reinstall Windows over itself, and if a damage Windows file is part of the problem, escape without the major pain of reformatting. \n\n========\nFirst, without the installation CD (or copies of all the files from it) you're sunk. I'm not sure from what you say whether you have a copy of the CD on your second drive or not. If you don't ... Trouble lies that way. \n\nSecond, You must backup everything you have on the C drive that is not reinstalled from the distribution disks. And you must be certain that whatever backup method you choose will be able to actually read the backup formatted files after the reinstallation. It is not unusual, sadly, for some backup programs to be unable to actually read in the backup files it creates. \n"Backup" includes the operating system (Microsoft has dropped support for 98 and for SE, so you would be well advised to update -- my suggestion is to 2000, but some folks are willing to settel for 2000 Lite -- ie, XP. Or even to make this your opportunity to switch to a vendor who poses fewer problems -- the main option as I write this is one of the kind_of_Unixen), Linux -- my favorite is the SuSE distribution). And "backup" includes application files as well. Identifying just which files these are, and where they are is not always easy. Clearly all your pictures and documents you've written and would qualify, but applications (and operating systems) usually have several configuration files, history files, backup files, index files, ... which it will save time to have copes of. But, if an application doesn't provide for saving these and reinstalling them over a fresh installtion of the application, ...  There will be problems here as well. You might have to reconfigure some or all of your applications (and the operating system too) after reinstallation. this is a pain, but may be unavoidable...\n\nThird, you must be certain that any new hardware you've installed will be recognized by the Windows boot routines at reinstallation time. It might be wise to start a reinstallation (with the intent of cancelling it essentially immediately) to test whether the BIOS will call up the Windows installation routines from wherever they are, and whether they will be able to find the new hardware. Since hardware support (ie, drivers and design troubleshooting) for 98SE has mostly been dropped, increasingly more hardware will not be supported for 98SE.  Without support, you'll have to write your own drivers -- not recommended.\n\nFourth, you must, when reinstalling, configure your software in ways which are compatible with how they used to be configured, lest there be odd (perhaps fatal) happenings from the incompatibilites. Some things don't matter -- like icon colors or the shape of the cursor, but some will.\n\nFifth, keep a record of what you did and why at each step of the way, starting before you begin backing up. Include all instructions (and options) and the immediate re	Computers & Internet

question_title: how personal storage area network works, how good they are, and is it worth the money? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Defining SAN:\n\nStorage networks are distinguished from other forms of network storage by the low-level access method that they use. Data traffic on these networks is very similar to those used for internal disk drives, like ATA and SCSI.\n\nIn a storage network, a server issues a request for specific blocks, or data segments, from specific disk drives. This method is known as block storage. The device acts in a similar fashion to an internal drive, accessing the specified block, and sending the response across the network.\n\nIn more traditional file storage access methods, like SMB or NFS, a server issues a request for an abstract file as a component of a larger file system, managed by an intermediary computer. The intermediary then determines the physical location of the abstract resource, accesses it on one of its internal drives, and sends the complete file across the network.\n\nMost storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and devices, though they do not use its low-level physical interface.\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nSharing storage usually simplifies storage administration and adds flexibility since cables and storage devices do not have to be physically moved to move storage from one server to another. Note, though, that with the exception of SAN file systems and clustered computing, SAN storage is still a one-to-one relationship. That is, each device (or Logical Unit Number (LUN)) on the SAN is "owned" by a single computer (or initiator). In contrast, Network Attached Storage (NAS) allows many computers to access the same set of files over a network. It is now possible to combine the SAN and NAS using a NAS head, such as the gateway manufactured by ONStor\n\nSANs tend to increase storage capacity utilization, since multiple servers can share the same growth reserve.\n\nOther benefits include the ability to allow servers to boot from the SAN itself. This allows for a quick and easy replacement of faulty servers since the SAN can be reconfigured so that a replacement server can use the LUN of the faulty server. This process can take as little as half an hour and is a relatively new idea being pioneered in newer data centres.\n\nSANs also tend to enable more effective disaster recovery processes. A SAN attached storage array can replicate data belonging to many servers to a secondary storage array. This secondary array can be local or remote.\n\n\nSAN types:\n\nSANs are normally built on an infrastructure specially designed to handle storage communications. Thus, they tend to provide faster and more reliable access than higher level protocols such as NAS.\n\nThe most common SAN technology is Fibre Channel networking with the SCSI command set. A typical Fibre Channel SAN is made up of a number of Fibre Channel switches which are connected together to form a fabric or network.\n\nAn alternative, and more recent (2003), SAN protocol is iSCSI which uses the same SCSI command set over TCP/IP (and, typically, Ethernet). In this case, the switches would be Ethernet switches.\n\nOne alternative to iSCSI is the ATA-over-Ethernet or AoE protocol which embeds the ATA protocol inside of raw Ethernet frames. While a raw Ethernet protocol like AoE cannot be routed without something else performing the encapsulation, it does provide a simple discovery model with low overhead.\n\nConnected to the SAN will be one or more servers(hosts) and one or more disk arrays, tape libraries, or other storage devices. In the case of a Fibre Channel SAN, the servers would use special Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs) and optical fiber. iSCSI SANs would normally use Ethernet network interface cards, and often specialized TOE cards.\n\nStorage area networks are of two kinds - centralized storage area networks and distributed storage area networks\n\n\nCompatibility:\n\nOne of the early problems with Fibre Channel SANs was that the switches and other hardware from different manufacturers were not entirely compat	Computers & Internet

question_title: how to share microsoft outlook  with others? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Although Outlook is not designed for multiple users, it is possible to set it up for more than one user.  First, configure it to download multiple email accounts.  Then, set up rules to direct mail addressed to individuals to seperate subfolders in the inbox.  When someone responds to their mail, it will default to be from the email that received the message.  When starting new messages, Outlook will default to the primary account; other users will need to click on "accounts" and choose that the message be sent from their account.  This isn't an ideal solution, but can work.  Outlook will not know where to distribute messages that have been sent via blind copy, and sent messages will all be in the same folder, although users can move sent messages into their own subfolders.\n\nAn alternative way to have two people share one computer is to have one user utilize Outlook for their mail, and the other user utilize Outlook Express, or Thunderbird by Mozilla.

question_title: when something is deleted on your computer,it's still on your hard drive .right? [SEP] question_content: If its still on your hard drive, when time passes and more memory is taken up on the computer, is the old (deleted) data over written on the hard drive and forever unaccesable, or is a program needed to get rid of it.\nAnd also, does defragmentation also rewrite the memory space and rid the info. [SEP] best_answer: When you first delete a file, it does still exist on your hard drive. However, the space that the file took up on the drive is now free to be reused by other files. This does mean that a new file can overwrite the old file, making it difficult to read or retrieve. However, even when a file has been written over, it is still possible to retrieve the underlying data. I have read that in some cases, experts with advanced tools can retrieve files that have been overwritten five or six times. There are programs out there that make sure data is really deleted by overwriting a file up to a hundred times with random data. This is probably overkill, but I'm sure it's effective. In most cases for normal people, such extreme measures should not be necessary.	Computers & Internet

The printer has a drum in which all the printable characters are etched on to it.  The characters are actually RAISED up NOT etched in to the drum. The drum will be postioned parallel to the paper and ribbon and spins at a very high speed. The hammers will be positioned behind the paper. In other words the paper is in between the drum/ribbon and the hammers. \n\nAs the drum spins the respective hammer(s) will hit the paper pushing the paper against the ribbon and against the drum. This will then leave the imprint of the character on the paper. These printers usually have many of these hammers, some in the order of 24-48.  The drum has the characters etched on it in multiple rows usually skewed to the left by one character position.  See below:\n\n ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n\nThis format allows for every character to be in every position at any ONE rotation of the drum. When the particular character at a particular point needs to be printed, the respective hammer 'fires' striking the paper against the ribbon then against the drum. In this operation you can have as few as 1 hammmer firing or as many as al l of them...it just depends on what needs to be printed.\nHope this helps.  I have left out many particulars but this should be enough to give you a basic idea.	Computers & Internet

question_title: names of emmitt smith's children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Sometime in Emmit Smith's academic career, he received a paper with his name spelled "Emmitt" (notice the two T's). Emmit liked it, however, and decided to start spelling his name the same way. Thus was born the new Emmitt Smith. His father is Emmit Smith II and as a child, to avoid confusion, he was nicknamed "Scoey." He married Patricia Southall, on April 22, 2000. She is a former Miss Virginia, and the ex-wife of actor/comedian Martin Lawrence. Their son, Emmitt IV, was born on Smith's 33rd birthday, May 15. His entire family was on-hand and present on the sidelines that fateful October day in 2002 when he surpassed Walter Payton for the NFL rushing title.\n\nOn August 14, 2006, Emmitt James Smith, Sr., his grandfather died in Pensacola, he was 82.\n\nIn September 2005, Smith signed on to serve as a studio analyst on the NFL Network show, NFL Total Access.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, at halftime of the Cowboys-Redskins game (broadcast on Monday Night Football), Smith was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor with his longtime teammates Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin.\n\nSmith becomes eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, and it is widely expected that he will be inducted on his first attempt. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nIn 2006 he became one of the celebrities on the third season of Dancing with the Stars - Videos - [1]. It premiered on ABC September 12, which ended his time with NFL Network for the time being. He was partnered with Cheryl Burke, who danced to last year's championship with Drew Lachey. He drew mostly rave reviews from the judges and was a fan favourite as well. He did better at the Latin dances than the ballroom numbers, and suprised many people with how light he was on his feet. He chalked up his success on the show to his ability to accept coaching. On November 9th, 2006, he entered the finals of Dancing With The Stars along with Mario Lopez.\n\nOn September 30, 2006, he was one of the first four Gator legends inducted into the Florida Football Ring of Honor, alongside Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel, and Jack Youngblood.

I really don't know what to tell you. Just try them and see which one you like best or which one you are best at and go with that one. Sorry that I couldn't be of more help!!! Good luck, though.

question_title: What is the best thing to eat before a swim meet? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: hehe I think I come from the old school but whatever makes you feel good. I had a routine for meets. Steak 2 nights before, pasta night before, McDonald's in the morning 2 sets of hot cakes and 2 of those Cinnamon rolls(loved those things). And then for between prelims and finals I ALWAYS ate a large pizza from little Cesar's. I think eating those things just helped me have a standard to go by and not have to worry about what I was going to eat. (I would eat grapes during the meet)	Sports

question_title: What's More Entertaining? College or Pro Football? [SEP] question_content: With college you have rivalries that are much more bitter. You also seem to have a lot more team spirit. And the players are much more about their teams. \n\nIn the pros you have a much more sophisticated level of coaching  and a much higher level of play. \n\nJust curious for your thoughts. I prefer the college game more. [SEP] best_answer: Frankly, I feel that the college game is superior when you have great matchups or long-time rivalries...The excitement is generally far better than anything the pro game can provide. \n\nThe Pro game is hit or miss...Seeing one team crush another is rarely exciting and about the only time a game gets truly exciting is during the playoffs...

[SEP] best_answer: Tom Brady is a fine QB\n\nThe future is cloudy for Mr Brady ... If his offensive line is health he will put up good numbers for a bunch more years (meaning he will put number up in the 3000 yard seasons) with Laurence Maroney there now he will be able to hand the ball off more ... \n\nIf your wondering if you should keep Brady in a keeper league ... normally people only keep one or two players ... if he is your very best player then I say keep him\n\nGood Luck	Sports

question_title: What shoes are good for rock climbing? [SEP] question_content: Rock climbing is just a casual hobby, so I don't want to fork out the money on professional climbing shoes.  Can I use sneakers or some other kind of shoe?  What actually makes a good climbing shoe?  I will be using mostly indoor walls. [SEP] best_answer: ive been an avid rock climber for almost ten years...get rock climbing shoes if you intend to climb regularly.  there is nothing more scary than placing your foot on a ledge no wider than a centimeter and feeling your feet slipping around inside your shoe.  talk about a major sphincter check.  plus climbing shoes are designed to place the toes in the most powerful position to allow for adequate stepping and their soles are made of sticky soft rubber so slippage is minimized.  going barefooted may seem logical, but stepping on sharp points of rock and placing all your weight on it can be excuriatingly painful.  plus, sweaty feet equals slippery feet.  there are large numbers of climbing shoes that are quite affordable as well.  look at brands like mad rock, evolv, mammut, or search websites like REI.com.  ive seen shoes as cheap as 50 to 60 dollars.....about the same cost as running shoes.....if youre going to climb regularly, this is the best advice i can give you, from one climber to another...good luck and aloha	Sports
