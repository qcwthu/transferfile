question_title: do you know? [SEP] question_content: that Christ Jesus is soon on His way back? (I know some are going to show their ignorant side, and give smart alic answers, but i don't care.) This question is for believers. [SEP] best_answer: I believe Jesus will be coming back within the next 10 years - any time along that time frame - assuming the Antichrist shows his face between now and the next three years.\n\nThese dates are educated speculation based on global trends, so don't rip my head off :-)\n\nI expect THE Antichrist to show in the given time frame, and believe he will be using Islam and the Roman Catholic Church as his springboard. He will most likely be the Muslim's awaited Mahdi.\n\nThe False prophet will (most likely) be a Roman Catholic Pope or someone in the Roman Catholic hierarchy pretending to be Jesus who will tell the world, that Islam's awaited Mahdi is the true chosen one. - my belief is based on recent as well as current events weighed in line with scripture.

[SEP] question_content: What do you think of his books especially the "Purpose Driven Church" and his One World Denomination programs over in Africa?  Do you like his books and him or against him? [SEP] best_answer: Speaking from my opinion only, I am kinda anti-Rick Warren.  I do have "The Purpose Driven Life," because I was genuinely interested in reading it.  However, after the success of the book it seems that everything went purpose driven.  There are purpose driven ties, coffee mugs, and I bet I could find a purpose driven pet carrier if I looked hard enough.

question_title: The Bible states that Tongues are a sign.........? [SEP] question_content: The Bible states in 1St Cor. Ch.14 V22 that "Tongues are a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not" Who are those people refered to as "THEM" [SEP] best_answer: Them refers to unbelievers or those who are not Christians. There is great misuse of tongues in the church. If everyone in the local church speaks the same language, say english, there is no need to speak in a tongue that not everyone is going to understand. God doesn't want confusion in the church. Also if you have the gift of tongues, you will not have to learn to speak it, you will speak naturally although you may not understand it. Either the person who speaks in a tongue is to interpet what is being said or someone else who knows the interpetation. If nobody can interpet the tongue than no one should be talking in that language.  Not everyone has the gift of tongues either.	Society & Culture
question_title: If so, is there any way WE CAN BE SET FREE FROM INHERITING ADAM'S SIN? [SEP] question_content: ROMANS 5:12 states that "THROUGH ONE MAN, SIN ENTERED THE WORLD". Am I correct in my understanding that the "ONE MAN" being referred to is ADAM.\n\nIt just seems SO UNFAIR that WE HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR A MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE BY SOMEONE ELSE... [SEP] best_answer: We don't have to pay for anything but our own actions.\nDoes anything else seem logical to you, other than that.\n\nTaking on Adam and Eve's "sin" is preposterous.\nPlease ... don't we have more logic than that?\n\nWhy yes ... yes we do!     : )\n\nEDIT:  All of the thumbs down Christians just proved a point made in another YA question.  If you don't agree with an opinion different than your own, you click the thumbs down.  I don't do that, even if I don't agree with the opinion.  We are all entitled to our opinion and our answer.

question_title: Doesn't a lightning rod on top of church show a lack of faith? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I find it fascinating that you consider God in such a comic book-super hero mentality.  Because a church uses a lightning rod, it means they're afraid God won't reach down and magically shield them from harm.  Come to think of it, that WOULD make a pretty good super hero.  Too bad it just doesn't work like that.\n\nBy the same token, Christians should just ignore all common sense and step in front of cars, bullets, etc.  It's on God to protect one of His own, right?  Come on now.  We all live in the same world.  Both the righteous and evil face the same physical properties of our planet--not to mention the tragedies that humans cause.\n\nFaith in God is so much more than just blithly expecting Him to automatically shield all of us from harm.  What's the alternative--if we slip up, we're just dead meat?  God loves us all--even the skeptical like yourself--and does protect us from evil.  He just can't stop the world from turning--even if Superman can.	Society & Culture

question_title: I hear lots of people say how Jesus changed their lives. Does the OT version of God ever change anyone's life? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone convert to Christianity because of anything said in the Old Testament? [SEP] best_answer: People might convert to Christianity by seeing how the prophecies of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament, but that requires a lot more education that most people care for.  Still, I can tell you that the OT changed my view of Christianity.  Before reading it, I always saw the religion as very dichotimized, with the OT God light years away from the NT God.  Having read it, I now realize that's not true.  There's a lot more of a loving God in the OT than people usually give credit for.  Likewise, the NT God is frequently harsher than Christians would care to admit.  It's given me a much more unified, clearer perspective.	Society & Culture

If there are any, can you please tell me how your experience was? I know of other people of different backgrounds that have went to Japan, but I have not gotten feedback from any Hispanics that have gone there. Please help! [SEP] best_answer: My friend's wife is from Colombia.  They met while they were studying at an American university, and when he returned to Japan, she followed him.  They eventually got married, but she had a real difficult time for the first year or so because she spoke no Japanese.  Now, after having been in Japan for ten years, she says she loves it here and never want to move to another country, including her home country.  I think Lations and Japanese share some of the same values, like importance of family, so it might be easy to assimiliate in that regards.	Society & Culture

I am an educated person and I understand the moral implications of the word, but seriously why don't people get a life? [SEP] best_answer: the people you are speaking to probably have a problem with 'normal' because they are not and sadly like the rest of parents since the late 80's they believe that positive reinforcement is the way to go so they tell little Johnny he is better than normal which leads to such problems as no-talent idiots thinking they can sing and thus auditioning for pop/american/australian idol and not understanding why they are being told they suck because there have never been enogh 'normal' people to tell them the truth before. that's just one example anyway!

He defeated all the 5 Pandavas and went on a killing spree killing maharatha after maharatha.For the 1st time ever in the war, he used the BRAHMADANDA on the 15th day. As it was an irresistible weapon superior even to the BRAHMASTRA & PASHUPATASTRA, Drona was unstoppable on the 15th day of war, thereby neccesiating the Pandavas to kill him by unfair means. But, why did Drona not use this weapon against Abhimanyu & Ghatotkatch and prefered to get defeated by them ? On the contrary, he was the one who advised the Kauravas to kill Abhimanyu by unfair means ! Why did Drona act so ? [SEP] best_answer: Because he forgot...	Society & Culture

question_title: Batman's costume is dark so he can hide in the shadows.  So why is Robin's costume bright colors? [SEP] question_content: Seriously, my youngest son wants to know.  Has this ever been addressed in the comic books? [SEP] best_answer: The real answer is that the editors that created Robin way back when wanted to create a character that was appealing to kids, the main audience for comics then. And none of the editors since have had the nuts to say "Y'know what? That kinda doesnt make sense. Lets change that." \n\nIts kinda like why superheroes still have costumes with their shorts on the outside. Its outdated stuff that the editors believe cannot be changed without ruining the character, when in truth we want silly things like that changed, for the better, for the more realistic.\n\nStill the latest Robin costume and character is much darker, and Nightwing is too.

question_title: Does anyone else think that are too many people with superpowers in the new TV series, HEROES? [SEP] question_content: How long will this go on?, another character with superpowers every week.  I still like the show, but I'm afraid they will go to far at some point. [SEP] best_answer: That is the whole point....that there are more of these people than one might think.   The idea behind Suresh's work was that the humna race was changing and having more of these people show up reinforces that plot perspective.   Add to that the idea that it goes along with the idea that these people will be connected somehow beyone their powers is just part of the whole myster of how they came into being to begin with and the nature of their genetic differences.   How else could Nikki and her husband both have had powers and neither knew it until last week.   Or the connection between Hiro and Nikki through Hiro's friend, or the conneciton between Peter and Issac.   These people are supposed to met and come tegether at some point...and having these connections between them, chance encounteres and the like is just part of how that happens.   Kind of like a 6 degrees of separation sort of thing.   Or the idea that people like this will always be drawn together even if they don't know each other.\n\nOnce they have introduced all the main players...the number of people with powers should stabilize....and only a few should pop up now and again as necessary plot devices to sort of cement the character traits of some of the more regular players.

question_title: Episode III deleted scenes? [SEP] question_content: I would like someone that has the star wars dvd to please list all the extra scenes in the deleted scenes section. Name and what happens and how long is the clip. [SEP] best_answer: I dont remember them all but let me put in a little info.\n\nFirst: The one major deleted Scene i can tell you was there was a meeting between mon Mothma (wish they hadnt deleted her scene since it was such news as to how she would look a lot younger. Admirl Ackbar, Padme and some others. they were talking about how Palpetine was too powerfull and if he retained his power they should try to fight him. This was entitled (i think) "Rebellion Birth"\n\nNow here's the interesting thing.\n\nIn 1983 George Lucas wrote the scripts for Ep 1-3. I came upon copies of these in 1993 at a mall. The original name for Ep 3 was "Fall of the Republic"\nIt had a..... differnet twist in the storyline, one i wish they had stayed with.\n\n1. The jedi learn of a crystal on Mustafar (the lava world) that can bind and balance the force if they get it. Palpetine learns of the same crystal and knows if he gets it, it will bind his powers as emporer. Obi-wan is sent by the jedi and Anakin is sent by Palpetine. The battle over the lava happens at the beggining of the story versus the end of the story. \n\n2. At some point, Padme is captured and imprisoned. When trying to escape (as stormtroopers seize Corouscant under the new Emporer) she is killed in a cross fire between rebels to be and the ST's.\n\n3. To ensure the government will remain loyal to him, Palpetine orders a blockade of Corouscant. Hoping he can keep all the senators on the planet and under his control, a large space battle happens when Ackbar, Mon Mothma, pilots and soldiers who uppose Palpetine's new order attempt to flea the capitol to form the rebellion. \n\nThese were changed but they would have been better left in it.

Luckily, in each case, we were able to control the fire, before packing up, and calling the Fire Dept.\n\nAlso, on these camping trips, we used to take a Fourwheeler, and drive down the Highways in the area, to the local Convenience Store in the middle of the night (4-5 miles away) and buy Food, and Drink. Parents caught wind of this, and told me not to, but I'd do it anyways. I never got caught by the Cops, but my buddy did one night, when I wasn't there.\n\nHow did we not get caught other than his incident?? Just lucky, I guess. Always obeyed any street signs and Traffic lights. I mean come on, there could have been worse things that I did as a Teenager.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which is more powerful? [SEP] question_content: A smile or a kind word? [SEP] best_answer: How very chicken or the egg. :) I'll explain why......\n\n\nIn my opinion, it is a smile. I've had kind words said to me many times before. At times, someone will email me a kind word, or phone me with a kind message...... or stop me in the hallway at work with a quick word. It always means a great deal to me......and what does it do? I makes me smile. So having said this.... one might conclude that the kind word was so powerful that it caused the smile. But what caused the kind word?\n\nThere are times when someone will speak a kind word and you never know if it is meant with sincerity or not. The smile says so much. I could tell you how amazing you are while looking at my feet and I'm just not sure it would have the same effect as when I look in your eyes and it makes me smile. The power behind that smile is ginormous! It can say so much more than the verbal word. The look in the eyes....the tremble of the lips..... the intake of the breath. The scrunch of the noses... the creation of the dimple... the beauty of the smile. \n\nThat smile can then cause someone to feel as confident, as secure, as happy, as driven as they could ever be. Allowing them to pass on a smile..... a kind word.. a simple gesture. \n\nThe power of the smile is massive. The power of the kind word is as well. But to smile while speaking the word...... that's when you know you could take on the world!	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Computing height vs distance to horizon? [SEP] question_content: If you know your height above the ground, how far away is the horizon, or how can compute the distance to the horizon? [SEP] best_answer: It's a geometry problem.  Suppose you're high up in a building on the beach overlooking the ocean.  You're at height h above sea level.\n\nNow draw a circle which represents the earth, with radius r.  Your distance from the center of the earth is r+h.  The horizon is some distance away, x.  Your line of sight to the horizon is <tangent> to the radius of the earth, forming a right triangle, where the hypoteneuse is r+h.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\nr^2 + x^2 = (r+h)^2 = r^2 + 2rh + h^2\nx^2 = 2rh + h^2\nx = sqrt(2rh + h^2)\n\nThat's the exact answer,  But for practical purposes, 2rh is <much, much> bigger than h^2.  To see this, suppose you're 500 feet in the air.  That's about a tenth of a mile, and using miles, h^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01.  On the other hand, the earth's radius is about 4000 miles, so 2rh = 2 x 4000 x 0.1 = 800.  This is 80,000 times bigger than h^2.\n\nSo we can safely ignore the h^2, and say x = sqrt(2rh).  That can be broken down further.  Again using miles (you can also do this in kilometers),\n\nx = sqrt(2rh) = sqrt(2r) sqrt h = sqrt(8000) sqrt h = 90 sqrt h\n\n(rounding off, since sqrt 8000 = 89.44; also, h must be in miles).\n\nUsing the formula x = 90 sqrt h, suppose you're in an airplane 4 miles up in the air (21,000 feet).  Then the horizon is 90 sqrt 4 = 180 miles away.\n\nOkay, now let's work it out for h in feet instead of miles.  We'll go back to the formula x = sqrt(2rh), and use r = 3960 miles (a more accurate figure).  Then\n\nx = sqrt(2 x 3960 x h / 5280) = sqrt(3h/2) = 1.225 sqrt h\n\nwhere h is in feet and x is in miles.\n\nTwo examples:  (1) For h = 6 feet, use x = sqrt(3h/2) = 3 miles.  (2) For x = 100 feet, use x = 1.225 sqrt h = 12.25 miles.\n\nTo recap:  For h in miles, use x = 90 sqrt h.  For h in feet, either use x = sqrt(3h/2) or x = 1.225 sqrt h.\n\nIn all cases, x will be in miles.  And of course, all of this can be done using meters and kilometers.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Bernoulli's principle? [SEP] question_content: how is a barometer used to pertain to bernoulli's principle? [SEP] best_answer: From an amateur:\n\nBernoulli's principle says that a rise (fall) in pressure in a flowing fluid must always be accompanied by a decrease (increase) in the speed, and conversely, if an increase (decrease) in , the speed of the fluid results in a decrease (increase) in the pressure. This is at the heart of a number of everyday phenomena. As a very trivial example, Bernouilli's principle is responsible for the fact that a shower curtain gets ``sucked inwards'' when the water is first turned on. What happens is that the increased water/air velocity inside the curtain (relative to the still air on the other side) causes a pressure drop. The pressure difference between the outside and inside causes a net force on the shower curtain which sucks it inward. A more useful example is provided by the functioning of a perfume bottle: squeezing the bulb over the fluid creates a low pressure area due to the higher speed of the air, which subsequently draws the fluid up.\n\nThis lowering of pressure in a constriction of a flow path may seem counterintuitive, but seems less so when you consider pressure to be energy density. In the high velocity flow through the constriction, kinetic energy must increase at the expense of pressure energy.\n\nBy measuring the pressure of the medium (by way of a barometer) we can tell a lot about it's velocity and overall energy.  This data would be useful for aeronautics (i.e. airfoil research), civil engineering (i.e. water and waste management), and meteorology (i.e. storm watching).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is the universe and ordered or chaotic one? why? [SEP] question_content: Is the universe and ordered or chaotic one? why? [SEP] best_answer: This is not an either/or situation.  The Universe as seen by physics is a trend for ordered sub-systems to become more chaotic over time.  This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states "The entropy of an isolated system not at equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value."  However NO sub-system is ever really isolated.\n\nLiving systems tend to reverse the "normal flow" toward higher entropy.  One might say that life runs counter to the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Living systems tend to induce order to random elements of the Universe over time.\n\nThe best answer to your question is that the Universe is both Ordered and Chaotic, depending upon what localized portion of the space-time continuum one is observing.

question_title: Gravitational Potential Energy? [SEP] question_content: A shot-putter puts a shot (weight = 71.6 N) that leaves his hand at distance of 1.60 m above the ground.\n(a) Find the work done by the gravitation force when the shot has risen to a height of 2.09 m above the ground. \n \n(b) Determine the change (PE = PEf - PE0) in the gravitational potential energy of the shot. [SEP] best_answer: Work = Force x Distance\n\nIn this case, since the shot is going up, i.e. opposite the force, the work done on the shot is negative.  Another way to look at it, if up is our positive direction, the distance will be positive but the force, i.e. the weight, is negative.  Note that the distance over which the weight acts is the difference in height, not the entire height of the shot relative to the ground.\n\nW = Force x distance = Weight x distance = - 71.6 N (2.09 m- 1.60m)\n\nI'll leave the arithmetic to you.\n\nTo answer the second part, just notice that the change in potential energy of the shot will be equal in amount to the work done on it.  Just take away the negative sign, since its potential energy is increasing. Another way of looking at it is to say that the work done on the shot takes away its kinetic energy, hence the negative sign, and converts it to potential energy.\n\nSince you're only concerned with the change in potential energy, you only have to concern yourself with the difference in height.  If you want to use the ground as the reference level, and calculate potential energy, you get\n\nDEL PE = PFf - PEi = Weight x final height - weight x initial height\n\nDel PE = 71.6 N (2.09 m- 1.60m)\n\nSo it works out to the same thing.  Yippee.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What happens (physically) when the Earth experiences a 'Pole shift'? [SEP] question_content: Please be specific without scientific terms. Does the earth stop rotating and spin the other direction? If not, What? What happens on the surface of the Earth? [SEP] best_answer: well there are two answers.  The pole is actually shifting as we speak albeit to such a minor degree that we would never notice during our lifetimes.  The present 'north star' polaris was not always the 'north star' and in the future a new 'north star' will take it's place.  There have been drastic pole shifts possibly resulting from the passage of an enormous comet or asteroid within or close to the orbit of the moon.  When this occurs, drastic changes take place in a short span of time.  It is theorized that the break-up of pangaea into the continents was caused by a sudden pole shift.  From Straight Dope :Geologist Jean Andrews of Columbia University has found evidence to suggest that 180 million years ago the poles were displaced about 22 degrees from their present alignment, with the North Pole located on the northern coast of what is now the Soviet Union.

question_title: difference between national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A national park is just any piece of land set aside by the government to not be touched.  An example would be the "Emerald Circle" that winds through the Cleveland area.\n\nA wildlife sanctuary is a specific habitat of an animal that is endangered.  An example would be the wetlands in Arkansas where the Ivory Billed Woodpecker was recently seen.  This is protected in the same way that a national park is.\n\nA biosphere is a specific ecosystem, including all plants and possibly animals, that exists in an area not normally associated with this ecosystem.  Because of the translocation and possible interaction with local ecosystems, a biosphere must be completely enclosed and self-sustaining.  An example would be, say, a rainforest that is maintained within a zoo.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the Singular Value Decomposition for? [SEP] question_content: I dont know, can anybody tell me what is it for? what application i can do with the SVD? [SEP] best_answer: First of all, let me know at what standard u need the answer.  Accordingly I will answer.  Essentially, SVD is used in Matrix algebra.  If you are below graduation, here is the simplest answer.\n\nSuppose you have two linear equations, with two unknowns, we will try to solve them as simultaneous equations.  similarly, if there are three quations with three unknowns, still we can attempt for solution.  Suppose there are mor equations than the number of unknowns, as in the case of randomised variables, that is four equations but three unknowns then the problem becomes serious.  we need to find the unknowns but satisfying all the equations.  Here we use this technique.  We try to find the solution of such cases using matrix inversion using Marquardt's algorithm or the solution of the characteristic equation leads to finding the eigen values.  So and so the theory continues.  That is why I asked at what level u need the answer?	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What will be the genotype and allele frequencies of the next generation? [SEP] question_content: Suppose that a small island population of 100 individuals is visited by 25 sailors who decide to stay and raise families.  Suppose also that 36% of the original population had a counter clockwise hair whorl and that all the sailors had a counter clock wise hair whorl.  \n\nWhat will be the genotype and allele frequencies of the next generation?\n\nThis is an example of what kind of evoluntionary force? [SEP] best_answer: This is a fairly long answer... first you need to get the initial allele frequencies. equation is p2 + 2pq + q2 (p2 and q2 from here on in is p squared and q squared)\nSince I am left to assume that counter clockwise is recessive then .36 is the initial q2. Taking the square root of that we get .6 as the initial allele frequency for q. 1-q=p so p=1-.6=.4. In other words, the island initally has 80p (clockwise)alleles and 120q (counterclockwise) alleles since humans are diploid and have two copies of each gene.\nNow, the 25 sailors have have added 50 copies of the q allele thereby changing the allele frequencies. The new allele frequencies are (120+50)/250 for q and 80/250 for p. when you do the math you get .32 for p and .68 for q. This will be the allele frequencies for the next generation too. \nNow plugging those numbers into the equation that I sited earlier you get .1024 for p2, .4352 for 2pq and .4624 for q2. You can give those a dominant/recessive notation such as WW for p2, Ww for 2pq, and ww for q2 to show genotype frequencies. \n\nThe evolutionary force at work is migration. \nhope this is what you were looking for.

question_title: Velocity Physics Question? [SEP] question_content: A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of 110 ft/s at an angle of 500 above the horizontal.\n Using g = 9.8m/s2, find:\n \ni)  Maximum height (apex).\nii)  Time to top (apex).\niii)  Total time of flight.\niv)  Down range of the ball.\nv)  Velocity of the ball upon striking ground. [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure what 500 above the horizontal means - radians maybe?  Or is there something missing, like a launch angle, and that you're 500 ft above ground when the ball is thrown?\n\nIf I'm picturing the scenario right, you're basically shooting a ball up at an angle and finding all of the specifics - max height, velocity at impact, etc.  All of those can be found using some of the following equations:\n\nvf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad\nvf = vi + at\nd = vt\n\nwhere\nvf = final velocity\nvi = initial velocity\na = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 or 32.2 ft/s^2)\nt = time\nd = distance\n\nHorizontal and vertical velocity are independent of each other.  The vertical velocity changes due to gravity, and the horizontal velocity will remain constant throughout the ball's flight (assuming no air resistance is in play).  So to find the max height, we'd need the vertical velocity component of the 110 ft/s.  That comes out to 110 sin x (where x is that launch angle I asked for earlier).  So this will be your vi in your first equation.  vf = 0 at the apex (the ball has stopped and is about to reverse direction), and since you are decelerating, use -32.2 ft/s^2 (I know you specified 9.8 m/s^2, but the units don't match the 110 ft/s - you can always convert one or the other if you like).  Solving that first equation will give you the distance it traveled.  If there is an additional height involved (remember if I asked if you were 500 ft above ground?) then your total height from ground level would be your answer from the equation plus 500.\n\nThe time to the apex can be found with the second equation.  Again, using vi = 110 sin x and vf = 0, you can solve for the time (and again, keep your units consistent or else the answer doesn't make sense).\n\nLet's jump to the last question about the velocity of the ball upon impact.  If it falls to the same height that it was thrown at, then the velocity on impact will be the same as the launch velocity - 110 ft/s.  But if there is that additional 500 ft height, we can use that first equation to find the vertical component of the impact velocity.  If we were to picture that part of the equation as starting from the apex, vi = 0.  The distance d will be the distance found in part (i) plus 500 ft.  So you can solve for the final velocity there - but remember that this only solves for that vertical component of the total velocity.  You'd need to find that total via the Pythagorean theorem - picture a triangle with the vertical velocity as one leg, and 100 cos x (the horizontal component of the original launch velocity) as the other leg.  Square both, add, and take the square root to find the total velocity on impact.\n\nOn to part (iii) - now that you have the final velocity (just use the vertical component as calculated above), you can use the second equation to find the time it took to fall from the apex to the ground.  Add this to the answer in part (ii) and you have the total time in flight.\n\nDown range, I'm assuming, is the horizontal distance the ball traveled.  Using the third equation, you can find that.  The velocity in this case is the horizontal component of the launch velocity - 100 cos x.  Take this times the time from part (iii) and you have the range.\n\nHope this helps - figure out what that launch angle is and how that 500 plays in to the equation and you should be on your way!

question_title: Why is it so windy yearly around Passover/Easter time? [SEP] question_content: When I was a girl, my mother used to use a term in Spanish called "Vientos de quaresma" which means Easter Winds!I have noticed a lot of wind all day today. I know that in the bible, The Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as Wind and in the bible, on the day of Pentecost, it mentions how the Holy Spirit's power fell in a powerful way and it was described as a mighty rushing wind and the people in the upper room all began to speak in tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance! [SEP] best_answer: This has little to do with Easter/Passover and more to do with the time they occur, during the vernal equinox. The Sun has crossed the equator back into the Northern hemisphere again, and is causing temperature differentials, with which comes great winds as they cause pressure differentials. \nYou will notice similar violent winds during the autumnal equinox, as the Sun recedes behind the equator again.

question_title: animal which cannot swim? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: most of the animals mentioned so far can swim, but they are so inefficient at it they are never seen doing it. There are a very select number of animals in the entire world who are physically incapable of swimming, and the majority of them have adapted to living in places where water is almost non-existent. The food of small desert reptiles can include tiny herbivorous organisms such as flying insectoids that are happy to sit on still water, and are highly bouyant, but are incapable of directional swimming on the surface or underwater (Its easier to simply fly for these animals, so the ability was never needed and thus never developed).

question_title: Differentiate 2x sin x? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: As Stuart has said above, you need to use the product rule to work this out.  The product rule states:\n\nthe derivative of f(x)g(x) is f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)\n\nSo, when you differentiate sinx wrtx you get cos and when you differentiate 2x wrtx you get 2.  Plugging these into the formula above you get:\n\n(f(x)g(x))'=2x(cosx)+2(sinx)\n                =2xcosx + 2sinx\n\nHope that this is helpful!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If a weather report and it says partly cloudy, then the next day it says partly sunny, what’s the difference? [SEP] question_content: If a weather report and it says partly cloudy, then the next day it says partly sunny, what’s the difference? [SEP] best_answer: This is a trick question. There really isn't much of a difference. They all mean the sky is part clear, and part cloudy. It just gives us a larger vocabulary to work with. \n\nAlthough most of the time, we'll tend to use it as a bit of psychological factor. If the forecast is improving (as in, rain event is just ending and we'll clear up a bit), we'll usually go partly sunny. \n\nIf the forecast is deteriorating (as in, it's sunny now, but rain moving in tomorrow), we might say mostly cloudy as the condition during the increasing clouds. \n\nWe tend to save 'partly cloudy' for nighttime, since we can't use partly sunny.

question_title: Could someone show me this? [SEP] question_content: Let H be a subgroup of a group G. Show that G acts on G/H by left-translation. Is this action transitive? [SEP] best_answer: G/H = {xH: x is in G}.\n\nAction: g.(xH) = (gx)H for every g and x in G.\n\nThis is indeed a left action because: (i) the group operation is associative (so (g''g').(xH) = g''.(g'.(xH)) for every g' and g'' in G and (ii) ex= x (so e.(xH) = xH).\n\nIt is transitive because, to satisfy g.(xH) = yH, it is enough to take g = y(x^-1)).\n\nNote: need H to be normal if the notation G/H is to be legit because it means the quotient group. H need not be normal for G to left-act on the *set* {xH: x is in G}, but this set won't be a group w/o normality of H.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Definitely ALASKA.\n\nFascinatingly, Alaska is the state that is farthest north, east, and west while Hawaii is farthest south. The reason that Alaska is farthest east and west is due to the fact that the Aleutian Islands cross the 180° meridian of longitude, placing some of the islands actually in the Eastern Hemisphere and thus degrees east of Greenwich (and the Prime Meridian).

question_title: What is SPACE? SPACE Where our Earth and Galaxy are floating. Is there end to this space? [SEP] question_content: Is it contained (Held) between something? I am curious [SEP] best_answer: Space has been an interest for philosophers and scientists for much of human history, and hence it is difficult to provide an uncontroversial and clear definition outside of specific defined contexts. Disagreement exists on whether space itself can be measured or is part of the measuring system. The term is also used somewhat differently in different fields of study. Many fields use an operational definition in which the units of measurement are defined.\n\nSpace is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics, meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present. Thus, similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities (like time and mass), space is defined via measurement. Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second (exact). This definition coupled with present definition of time makes our space-time to be Minkowski space and makes special relativity theory to be absolutely correct by definition.\n\nIn classical physics, space is a three-dimensional Euclidean space where any position can be described using three coordinates. Special and general relativity uses spacetime rather than space; spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional space (with the time axis being imaginary in special relativity and real in general relativity, and currently there are many theories which use more than 4-dimensional spaces (both real and complex).\n\nBefore Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's have shown that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one symmetric object -spacetime. (Distances in space or in time separately are not invariant versus Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski spacetime are - which justifies the name).\n\nThe measurement of physical space has long been important. Geometry, the name given to the branch of mathematics which measures spatial relations, was popularised by the ancient Greeks, although earlier societies had developed measuring systems. The International System of Units, (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used within science.\n\nGeography is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing the Earth, utilising spatial awareness to try and understand why things exist in specific locations. Cartography is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualisation purposes and to act as a locational device. Astronomy is the science involved with the observation, explanation and measuring of objects in outer space.\n\nSpace in philosophy\n\nSpace has a range of definitions.\n\nOne view of space is that it is part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a set of dimensions in which objects are separated and located, have size and shape, and through which they can move. \nA contrasting view is that space is part of a fundamental abstract mathematical conceptual framework (together with time and number) within which we compare and quantify the distance between objects, their sizes, their shapes, and their speeds. In this view space does not refer to any kind of entity that is a "container" that objects "move through". \nThese opposing views are relevant also to definitions of time. Space is typically described as having three dimensions, and that three numbers are needed to specify the size of any object and/or its location with respect to another location. Modern physics does not treat space and time as independent dimensions, but treats both as features of spacetime – a conception that challenges intuitive notions of distance and time.\n\nAn issue of philosophical debate is whether space is an ontological entity itself, or simply a conceptual fr	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is thoracic outlet syndrom and its treatment? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Thoracic outlet syndrome consists of a group of distinct disorders that affect the nerves that pass into the arms from the neck and various nerves and blood vessels between the base of the neck and armpit. For the most part, these disorders are produced by positional compression of the suclavian artery and vein and the vertebral artery and the cords of the brachial plexus.\n\nIt is often recommended to modify activities in your life and/or workplace that may be aggravating your TOS symptoms. Patients who have jobs that require a significant amount of lifting, overhead and repetitive activity, or use of vibratory tools are encouraged to make changes in their workplace.\n\nPostural problems can be a concern for those experiencing symptoms of brachial plexus compression. These can be addressed with physiotherapy. Exercises to strengthen the muscles in the back (rhomboids), neck (trapezius and levator scapulae), and chest (serratus anterior), and to lengthen or stretch tight scalene muscles in the neck and pectoralis minor can be useful. With physical therapy, patients will notice some improvement. However, significant improvement will require several months of diligent therapy.\n\nSurgery to release the nerves in the region of the thoracic outlet (Brachial Plexus Decompression) is not a simple procedure, and it should be avoided if at all possible. It is only recommended if your problem is significant and there is little improvement in response to non-operative measures.\n\nI hope this could help a little.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why don't microwaves stay hot inside? [SEP] question_content: Why is it when you take something out of a microwave it is always hot...but the inside is never hot.  Unlike an oven...where you can't touch the inside for at least an hour? [SEP] best_answer: An oven cooks by heating the air and then a combination of conduction and convection conveying this heat to the food.\n\nA microwave does not work in this way. It exposes the food with much longer wavelength radiation tuned to directly excite vibrational modes of water molecules. This means that the microwaves only heat things that contain water.

question_title: a contract valued at 15000 requires payment of $1684.65 at the end of every six months.if interest is 7.4%? [SEP] question_content: compunded semi-annually,what is the term of the contract? [SEP] best_answer: You want to find how long the contract is for.  Using the compound interest formula,\nA(t) = A (1+r/n)^(nt) where A(t) is final value, A is starting value, r is interest rate, n is number of times interest is counted in a year, t is number of years. In this case we want to figure t.  Thus,\n\n(15000+1684.65) = 15000(1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n16684.65 = 15000(1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n16684.65/15000 = (1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n1.11231 = (1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n1.11231 = (1.037)^(2t)\nln (1.11231) = (2t) ln (1.037) \n2t = ln (1.11231) /ln (1.037) \n2t = 2.93\nt = 2.93/2 \nt = 1.47 \nSo the term of the contract is 1.47 years or almost one and half year.

question_title: human body sparking..the "zap" thing.. ever experienced it? [SEP] question_content: static between persons.. why does it happen. can someone explain it please... seriously. [SEP] best_answer: It is just the equalizing of electrical charge between two people or a person and a conductive object.\n\nFor example, if your dragging your feet on the carpet, you are building up a greater negative electrical charge on your body.  When you come in contact with someone who has less negative charge than you, nature tries to make everything equal by sharing some of your negative charge.  \n\nSimilar concept if you add saltwater to pure water, the mix shares the salt with the "less salty" water.  Now the pure water is more salty, but the salt water is less salty than it was.  Hope this helps.\n\nThe link below is a bit more complex, but explains the underlying priciples.	Science & Mathematics

Mostly are single celled but need not be always.The size matters and it has to be microscopic.\nThese planktons are of two main types i) Phytoplanktons and ii) Zooplanktons.\ni)Phytoplanktons-: Basically these are planktons as mentioned above as they fit in to that category.In addition, they have chloroplasts with chlorophyll. So they can prepare their own food like all plants that we know.Therefore the prefix PHYTO- is put before them to indicate their plant like character and affinity with the Plant Kingdom.\nMany unicellular algae come in this group.They are found in the seas as well as fresh water.Diatoms Volvox Chlamydomonas Eudorina Pandorina are but a few examples.\nii) Zooplanktons-:Basically these are planktons as mentioned above as they fit in to that category.But they do not have  chloroplsts like the first one and hence they cannot prepare their own food.Thus they are more animal like in their nutrition and hence the prefix ZOO- is put before them to indicate their animal like character and affinity towards the Animal Kingdom.These are also found in sea and fresh water.Many protozoa and larvae of aquatic animals come in the category.\nHuge animal like Baleen Whale largy depend upon this planktonic flora and fauna for their subsistance.\n Now in the light of the above information kindly rephrase your question.

question_title: i get confused when when amd athlon say 3500+ and people say it 3.5ghz is that tru? [SEP] question_content: because when i go to cercuitecity.com or bestbuy.com it mentions 2.2ghz i dont get it. [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the number 3500+ is a relative rating that compares AMD to its competitor Intel. 3500+ means that it performs relative to a Pentium4 at 3.5 GHz. The architecture of the AMD cpu allows it to perform faster at lower clock speeds than intel processors, although that is not necesarily better. The current maximums of literal clock speeds is about 3.5GHz or 4GHz when overclocked. This literal speed has not been surpassed because of the amount of heat that the cpu generates, therefore companies have been modifying data pipelines and creating dual core cpus to get better performance. The real speed of your computer is still a balance between all components, so as sockets upgrade and architecture changes to better accomadate faster ram and hard drive speeds and real support of 64bit computing is created, performance can still increase while cpu clock speeds can't be raised.

question_title: how to develop a database replication system? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This thesis is centered around the topic database replication. The work has been motivated by the advances in the development of cluster databases and their specific demands in terms of high throughput, low response times, flexible load-balancing, data consistency and fault-tolerance. Eager, update-everywhere replication seems a promising mechanism to achieve these goals. By replicating data across the cluster, transaction have fast access to local copies and the available system can take over the work of failed sites. Using eager replica control the updates on the different copies are coordinated before the transaction commits providing data consistency and fault-tolerance in a straightforward way. Update-everywhere is a prerequisite for load balancing since only then a transaction can be submitted at any site without any restrictions. However, existing eager, update-everywhere solutions have severe performance limitations and are barely used in practice.\nWhat is needed is a solution that bridges the gap between theory and and practice, and implements efficient, eager, update-everywhere replication. The thesis provides several contributions to this goal.\nWe start with a detailed analysis of existing solutions depicting those assumptions and techniques that make current solutions inefficient and impracticable. In an attempt to eliminate these limitations the thesis presents a couple of basic techniques that we believe are necessary to provide efficiency: keeping the number of messages small, using the powerful multicast primitives of group communication systems to support replica control and fault-tolerance, simplifying the coordination between the database systems, avoiding deadlocks and a 2-phase commit protocol, and providing different levels of transaction isolation and fault-tolerance in order to adapt to various hardware and workload configurations.\nBased on these techniques the thesis develops a replication tool in three steps. First, we develop a theoretical framework including a family of replica control protocols. These protocols delay communication until the end of the transactions where all updates are multicast in a single message to all sites. By using a total order multicast as provided by group communication systems all messages arrive in the same order at all sites. By guaranteeing that all sites serialize conflicting transactions according to this order transactions are globally ordered without further coordination among the sites. In order to reduce resource consumption remote sites do not need to reexecute the operations but only apply the physical changes. The proposed replica control protocols provide different levels of isolation allowing for various degrees of concurrency. Furthermore, they offer two levels of fault-tolerance which vary in the degree of data consistency on failed nodes. All protocols provide data consistency on available sites and correctness criteria that are well understood and widely used in practice.\nIn a second step we evaluate our approach in two ways. First, we have built a simulation system that provides a performance comparison of all proposed protocols and a comparison with traditional solutions. This study shows that our approach provides superior performance compared to traditional solutions, is more stable and applicable for a much wider range of configurations and workloads. By providing a whole family of protocols the approach is able to adjust to the environment since the protocol can be chosen that is best suited to alleviate the specifics of a given configuration. In particular, the protocols are able to address high network costs and high conflict rates. Second, we have proven the feasibility of the approach in a real cluster environment by integrating it into the database system PostgreSQL. Most of the functionality has been added in separate modules and only few changes to the existing PostgreSQL system were necessary. With this, we are confident that the approa	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is the actual reason why do CPUs wont start. Good monitor and its cable... cpu dont display CMOS startup? [SEP] question_content: The Processor overheating.. Is it possible that sometimes it was a result of compatibility of power supply.   It was a second power supply.   It was used for almost 6 monsths.... [SEP] best_answer: There are many probable causes:\n\n!. Yes, the power supply may be the problem,  the power connectors from the supply to the motherboard may have loosened a bit or damaged.  A poor connection between the headers and the plug may burn the header connectors over time. I have experienced it before.  An irregular supply between the wires may cause system hangup (under or overvoltage supplies, remember, digital circuits need 5V or 12V with a 12% tolerance).  Frequent cooling down produces what we call "thermal runaway", when a component frequently heats and cools down, connectors become "loose" and continuity or contacts slowly separate resulting in poor contact.\n\n2.  CMOS SETUP.  You may have dead backup cells on the motherboard resulting in corrupted settings.  You may need to replace the CMOS backup cell.  \n\n3. Check for proper mating or connection between the signal cable and the video card connector.\n\n4.  Check your video card and have it tested to another good PC.  This may also be the culprit.\n\n5. Did you test your monitor to another PC again?	Computers & Internet

question_title: Does all computers come with only 1-yr warranty? [SEP] question_content: as titled, just wondering if I can get a computer that has a longer warranty period to avoid the hassles...Thanx. [SEP] best_answer: Most low end computers currently come with only 90 days, even Dell. You can buy extended warranties but unless it is a laptop, I wouldn't bother. Laptops take a lot more abuse and are much harder to upgrade or repair. Repairs are usually more costly also, since you usually have to buy parts from the company rather than generic parts. Most desktops, if you don't have a problem within the first 90 days you should be good. I have owned both high and low end computers since 1991 and the only thing I have ever replaced on a warranty on a desktop was a mouse.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How to use NTFS and FAT32  w/  Windows XP? [SEP] question_content: I recently formatted my C:&#92; drive - which is 40gigs. After the format, I reinstalled 98SE then the XP CD Upgrade. I then began to download SP2 when I realized XP is showing both my C:&#92; & D:&#92; with only 19g & 18g total size of the drives. Both are 40gb. \n\nAfter posting that question here, in regards to why this happened, someone said to load NTFS. So after some research, I found info on how to convert my drives from FAT32 to NTFS at: (http://www.mvps.org/marksxp/WindowsXP/fatntfs.php) and how to clean-install XP upgrade w/o having to install 98SE first at: (http://www.duxcw.com/faq/win/xp/clean.htm) .\n\nMy 1st question is, do I have to format my C:&#92; again and then convert? Or can I convert to NTFS w/o having to reinstall again?\nAlso, my D:&#92; is FAT32 and I want to change it to NTFS w/o losing my data. \nSo my 2nd question is can I convert my C:&#92; to NTFS first, then move all my data from my D:&#92; , which is FAT32, to the new C:&#92; using NTFS w/o losing data? \n\nAny help would be great! [SEP] best_answer: I am not certain that the trouble is the hard drive format. Whether you format a drive in FAT or NTFS, it will not cause the drive to be reported incorrectly. That is almost always caused by the BIOS or operating system misreporting the size of the drives. \n\nOlder motherboards, and older operating systems, had drive size limitations, they can't recognize drives over a certain size. \n\nYou should check the BIOS to see how it is reporting the drive sizes and go from there. Here is a good story on FAT and NTFS.\nhttp://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/l0606/16l06/16l06.asp\n\n\nIf you are still hoping to convert your hard drive to NTFS, here is some help from Microsoft:\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/307881/	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is meant by 100% book building offer in respect of public issues by corporate entities? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Whenever a company comes out with an IPO (Initial Public Offering), its valuation is done either internally by the company or most likely by an Investment Bank/ Private Equity, depending on its current revenues, profits, future prospects, management transparency, good corporate governance, etc.\nWith all these parameters and more they come to an approximate value of the company and decide the price band within which the valuation must be fixed, i.e. a lower limit and upper limit is fixed (Example price is between $20-$24)\nWhen potential investors apply for the shares they mention the price that they are willing to pay for the share. This is called 100% BOOK BUILDING, which is the most transparent method of arriving at the valuation of the company. \nIf the shares are over-subscribed, then the shares are allotted to the highest bidders and if any shares remain then to the nest lowest bidder and so on. So as a potential investor I think that if at $20 (Above example), I wont be allotted shares because a lot of people will bid more than me, I will increase my price. However if I think that the high price is unjustified, I will bid at the lower limit.	Business & Finance

question_title: Please explain how eBayers profit from selling ebooks at only $0.01 or $0.02 each. What about seller’s fees? [SEP] question_content: About listing fees, insertion charges, and final value costs, how is it profitable to sell items, for example, ebooks) for only $0.01 or $0.02 each?\n\nThe Listing Fee Schedule states that any item between AU$0.01 and AU$0.99 has a Listing Fee of AU$0.30.\n\nPlus, eBay charges an additional Closing Bid or Buy It Now final value fee of at least 5.25%.\n\nIt also says that even the "Buy It Now" option costs at least a flat fee of $0.10 per listing. So, how are eBay sellers achieving success selling so many low-cost items?\n\nIt is quite common to see such low prices, and seeing something priced, let's say, above $3.50, is very uncommon.\n\nPlease explain. [SEP] best_answer: Most of these sellers charge exorbitant shipping charges and make their money that way.  Even a paperback sold at 0.01 can be very profitable is you charge 3.50 for shipping.\nOthers, like myself in the past, are more interested in making quality books available to the largest amount of people, and therefore offer such items at a low price, knowing that they will go to an appreciative buyer.  This is the best way to recycle and is much better than throwing stuff away.  Surprisingly, there are a lot of people on Ebay who have motivations other than simply making money.	Business & Finance

question_title: Can I receive Social Serurity Disability benefits for having Fibromyalgia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes. I am on SSDI for Fibromyalgia. I had the problem that I filed when I was 27 years old so the Board that reviews the applicants denied me twice. Finally, my application was going before the Appeals Judge and before the court date he read my file. He overturned the original rejections and I received payment back to the date of disability. It took over two years for this process.\n\nMy best suggestion is that when you answer any questions answer as if it's your worst day possible. There's an article called Helping Fibromyalgia Patients Obtain Social Security Benefits by Joshua W. Potter, Esq.\nFrom: The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine September 1992\nhttp://www2.rpa.net/~lrandall/ssdi_fms.html\n\nAnother good article is http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/social_security_disability_fibromyalgia.html\n\nAnother helpful article is:\nWhy Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) & Fibromyalgia (FM) Sufferers Lose Their SSDI Claims\nby Janet Mizrahi\nImmuneSupport.com\n\n09-01-2000 \n\nYou feel awful all the time. You can barely dredge up the energy to take a bath, no less get dressed, go to work, and actually be productive. You know you’re disabled--your doctor knows you’re disabled. So you’ll win that disability case to get SSDI, right? Well, not necessarily so, says Scott Davis, an attorney who specializes in FM/CFS disability cases. \nAccording to Davis, “One of the biggest reasons people lose disability cases is because they don’t retain an attorney at the beginning of the process. It sounds self-serving, but it’s not,” he adds. “Disability attorneys work on contingency fee basis, meaning you only pay a fee if you win your case – you have nothing to lose.” \n\nUsing a lawyer before or at the time of filing a claim will help build the proper case to show to Social Security and a judge, who will ultimately hear the case and decide your fate. \n\nBut besides that, Davis says, an attorney can help you forge ahead with the process. Many people never bother to file a claim because they don’t have the energy or feel it’s just hopeless or simply because they don’t know what to do. An attorney not only can give you hope that you have a case, he or she guides you through the process. \n\nAnother death knell to a disability case, Davis says, is inadequate medical records. “Disability cases are ultimately won and lost on adequately documented medical records and detailed opinions from the treating physician regarding their ability to work, or their inability to work,” he states. \n\nLack of documentation can happen in a number of ways. One may be a result of a lack of adequate treatment. “Particularly in the FM/CFS arena,” Davis says, “people are repeatedly told by their doctors that there’s nothing medicine can do, to live with their illness and deal with it. Which is exactly what people do. They stop seeking treatment. \n\n“Or I’ve seen people do the opposite. They go to a host of doctors on an odyssey to get a diagnosis. After being worn out from seeing doctor after doctor and getting treatments without any benefit, they quit going. The attitude becomes, why bother? Nothing is helping to alleviate the symptoms.” \n\nBoth tactics result in barren medical records -- a huge mistake. “Even if you have a very good attorney, I’m only the orchestrator,” Davis says. “My ability to help a client is more limited if there are no medical records or if the medical records don’t say anything. Medical records load the gun for me to use when I argue a client is unable to work.” \n\nDavis suggests that ideally, people should view their medical records on a regular basis. This way you can see for yourself if your complaints of pain or other symptoms are being documented. If they are not, patients can tactfully ask their doctors to work with them to get the records in shape for their cases. Many general practitioners and HMO physicians are overburdened and do not take the time to dictate their repo	Business & Finance
question_title: what should i do with my 401k  w/  less than $5,000 from my previous employer.? [SEP] question_content: my new employer offers sep ira but i do not become eligible until 2007. any info is much appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: Under IRS rules, you can only roll over a 401k into a Traditional IRA and wait at least one year before moving it into Roth IRA. Remember, 401k sitting in previous employers will not have any growth. It is a frozen account until you roll it over.\n\nIRAs are always a good plan to save for retirement. You can pick any mutual funds that is offered by a financial institution (most mutual funds require a minimum initial deposit of $1000). And can be tax free after age 59 1/2 when you start using it.

question_title: What is the secret in number 7 from the Bible's point of view? [SEP] question_content: For example, the 7 seals, the 7 bowls, the 7 trumpets, etc. [SEP] best_answer: It's frequently used to signify completeness. At times it has reference to bringing a work toward completion.Or it can refer to the complete cycle of things as established or allowed by God.The 7 congregations mentioned in Revelation 1:20-3:22 give a complete picture of all the congregations of God on earth. The 7 heads of the wild beast of Rev.13:1 show the limit to which the beast would be allowed to develop. And a repetition of seven was equivalent to saying indefinitely or without limit at Matt. 18:21,22.	Business & Finance
question_title: Which high profile brands does GE own? [SEP] question_content: While watching the Olympics and noting that General Electric owns Bob Costas and NBC, I was curious about which other brands we see every day are companies owned by GE. Here are some that I know are already on the list:\n\nGE Energy (power generators, wind turbines, aircraft engines)\nGE Healthcare appliances (MRI, Ultrasonic, etc..)\nHotpoint appliances\nRCA (does this include the electronics as well?)\nNBC, MSNBC, CNBC\nUniversal Pictures and Universal Studios\n\nDoes anybody know of any others? [SEP] best_answer: Actually, RCA (and GE) appliances are no longer owned by GE.  GE got out of the appliance business some time ago, and sold the brand names to Thomson Consumer Electronics.  Thomson is a well-known brand in the European Union, but still uses the old established brand names in the US (RCA and GE). \n\nThe link below will show you all of the sub-brands actually still owned by General Electric.  It's interesting to note that more than one-half of the company's business is now in the financial services market.  They've diversified quite a bit from the days when they made lightbulbs, wouldn't you say?	Business & Finance

question_title: whats the earliest age can you walk home after school? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I started kindergaden at 4, and walked home a few times alone. I was in first grade twice, and at age 6 it was a long walk home. about 12 blocks in a suburb of Chicago. By 2nd grade, 3 blocks to school was easy and normal. But there were bullies that stole my lunch. And all kinds of things can happen in 3 blocks. I wouldn't trade those memories of walking to school for anything. I became a safety patrol in 5th grade, safety captain in 6th grade. And on bicycles, me and my friends ruled the streets! The video game was at the boweling ally, a pingpong then the lunar lander, both black & white. Age 7 is the earliest I would recomend, but when both parents work and have an infant to care for at home, walking just has to be for a young school kid. My sister was a year younger, she walked too. But not with me most of the time. We did get rides to school alot, but always had to walk home.	Business & Finance

It doesn't matter if you already know what they are about to say, or what they are thinking, everyone just wants someone to hear them. So after they are done talking/crying/yelling or whatever, then you talk to them calmly about how you feel about the situation. Don't be so quick to blame, just talk. If they still don't want to listen to you, then let them go,  they'll know where to find you once they are ready to listen.	Business & Finance
question_title: what is insiders trading what about the consequencess they should face on the insiders trading? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Insider trading is using privileged information in order to make a profit on the stock market. For example, if as a part of your job, you work for a multinational company, and you hear through the channels that your company is planning a takeover of a rival company. Such news will generally drive up the price of the shares of the company being taken over. If you were to purchase shares in the rival company, with the plans of selling them after the share price has been driven up once the takeover has been announced, you would be guilty of insider trading. (If you were caught, of course). Penalties can include jail time and heavy fines.	Business & Finance

I just watched a report on 60 Minutes about this subject and we are in deep trouble.  They showed a picture of the arctic in 1979 and one just taken six months ago.  It is unbelievable how much ice has melted in just 26 years.  The most noted authority on this catastrophe said that even if we were to stop putting greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, it wouldn't change the fact that our global temperature will still rise.  It probably wouldn't rise quite as fast, but it will still happen because of all the gases we have already emitted.  We can only sove this problem collectively as a human race and not separately as nations.	Business & Finance

question_title: Is the US a declining empire? [SEP] question_content: Seems like the US is a declining empire. They have elected an idiot for a leader and they are borrowing great sums of money from the world. Soon the American dollar will be worth less then a peso.China/Japan and other countries are quickly out pacing US technologies. You've squandered your natural resources and have become dependant on other countries for their resources. They are in a battle against a world wide organization that gets more supporters every time the US bombs a town. But, most of the US doesn't care about these issues or lies to themselves about these issues. They would rather kill each other for PS3's. Do you think the US is a declining empire? [SEP] best_answer: The U.S. is absolutely a declining empire.  It's a hard fact for most of us Americans to admit.  Most can't admit it at all.  But do a detailed comparison between decline of the Roman empire and the U.S. today (bread and circus, anyone?).  Or even the British empire and the U.S. today.\n\nAll countries and/or empires decline and fall.  It is a fact (and just a matter of time), although we may never live to see the end.

[SEP] question_content: No drugs were found nor did I possess any drugs.I was given this charge based on a law officer's word.No wire was used,but based on another person word who is not law enforcement. [SEP] best_answer: You shouldn't expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case.  It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details.  This is one of those situations where Y!A really isn't going to be especially beneficial for you.	Politics & Government
question_title: Post Divorce property? [SEP] question_content: Divorced for over a year now and the ex had rang up tons of debt with a POA and some in her name only as well while I was deployed, she allowed a car to get repo'd that was awarded to her that was in both out names and one credit card went to collection, I was awarded a auto loan that is in her name only and have possesion of the auto. Other than the divorce decree that awards me the debt what legal obligation do I have to pay the debt, as this would only affect her credit not mine and since she has all ready failed to pay her debts according to the divorce decree what obligation should I have to do the same. As of right now I cannot even contact the lender to obtain a pay off or even get the status of the account as she has locked me out and have red flagged the account so as to not allow me to even inquire about it. So even if I do pay the debt in full the title will go to her which in the long run means I will have to contact her to get the title. [SEP] best_answer: The bottom line is you have the pay the debt because the court ordered you too.  ALthough it will only affect her credit, you can bet if you don't pay she'll drag you into court on a contempt order.  Failing to obey the court's order will make you subject to arrest and imprisonment.  So to asnwer your question, the divorce decree is enough of a legal obligation - its all that's needed.  It a court orderfor you to pay the debt - if you don;t you get cited for contempt and go to jail.  If you don't like the decree get a lawyer and go into court to get a modification.  SHort of that, pay the debt.	Politics & Government

question_title: BUSH,he is defending all us Americans,can not you Dem,s see that? [SEP] question_content: dem,s keep blasting his work ,that has given us our freedoms from the terrorist, i say good job president bush...you are the best... [SEP] best_answer: What has he done in all reality to protect Americans .We began many years back to tighten up security at our Embassy's and those efforts have paid off .We also have become more alert to boats that approach our Naval Ships and have established a 24 hour watch and a 100 yard kill zone . We also have increased security at our air ports which we would of done after 9-11 regardless of who was president . We have taken a closer look at securing possible targets for terrorists which we would have done regardless of who was in the White house .\nSo I must ask what has Bush Done .\nFinding Bin laden would be nice if he is still alive but really the terrorists react to our policy not our military .\nWe could have 10 million troops in Iraq and nothing would change  whats going on .\nUnless we handcuff each Iraqi to one of our soldiers nothing will change for the better for 50 years there .\nThese people do not change a religion overnight or in ten years it will take several generations to change how these people look at the world and what they believe God wants them to do .\nIt was not long ago we had witch trials and in the 50's we had a communist hunt that ruined hundreds of lives for no reason at all .\nIraq and terrorists are more of a threat now then the day before 9-11 .\nThey now know that 9-11 did nothing to prevent us from destroying what was a religion and way of life for millions of people .\nWe are forcing these people to let their women educate themselves, work in the community ,and earn money . Choose what kind of life they want .\nThis goes against everything these people have been taught .It is part of the teaching they follow out of the religious book they have .\nIt requires women to be the subjects of the husbands and to do as they are told without question .\nYou can not change this way of thinking in 10 years .\nIt is going to take a long time .\nHad Bush understood these people and not the Americanized version ,he would of known better then to invade Iraq and try to attempt the impossible .\nI wish it had worked out the way Bush had it planned in his head .1) we move in and secure the area \n2) we remove Saddam and the evil people running Iraq .\n3) We install a new government that is open to change and democracy for all .Restoring women's rights and peoples freedom to live free and not under a dictator who has killed tens of thousands of his own people .\nI do not deny that Saddam is or was a BAD leader .It is just not up to America to fix the worlds problems .\nWe need to have the commitment of every major nation on earth to achieve a change such as this .\nWe do not have it .\nagain I say what has Bush Accomplished .\nHe has eroded our civil rights and what we thought was freedom from intrusion into our personal lives is now common.\nTapping phones is not going to end .The genie is out of the bottle .\nPeople who are charged with crimes now will soon face torture because we let that out of the bottle also .\nOur bank accounts are no longer as private as we would like .\nI am concerned that writing a check to habbebes' dry cleaning will get the once over .\nWe have under Bush had the Supreme Court rule Against his plans and actions on numerous occasions .\nBush As far as I am concerned has done little to protect us from terrorists and opened the door to increase the surveillance of people and soon we will be like England and a guy will announce over a loud speaker to walk that bike across the street or pick up that Taco bell rapper you dropped .\nDo we want big brother looking at us all the time .\nThey read our post here all the time , Screen the mail and open suspicious  packages ,and have created a society that turns people into the government for a cookie .\nAs far as i am concerned Bush In his Attempt to protect America has overlooked the inherent problems that we will have as a result  of his Presidency and the regulations and laws he has requested to be in-acted for our good .\nThey are goin	Politics & Government

question_title: Has Y! Politics Evolved by Users into Something Y! didn't expect, but is better than what they intended? [SEP] question_content: Seems to me that Y! Politics has become an anomolistic breed in Answers unlike anything else in Answers.  Obviously, Y! hates it but sometimes you need to let users decide how best to use a technology and roll with it, rather than fight it.  That's the whole POINT of Web 2.0, let the users dictate the direction and contribute the content, not have the corporations predict how people will want to use technology and participate.\n\nY! would be far more successful if they listened to the vibe that their users were giving them and responding to it, rather than constantly trying to squash it.\n\nY! Politics is interesting because everyone has (at least the capacity for) good questions and good answers to contribute to virtually every topic.  Other questions tend to be narrowly focused and largely unanswerable 99% of the time.  Doesn't that make this area pretty unique?  Its highly interactive subject really allows people's intelligence, personality, and humor (or lack thereof) to shine. [SEP] best_answer: I have often wondered when Yahoo would 'get it'. This site has evolved into something their Community Guidelines could never have anticipated. And their relentless pursuit to get users to 'conform' is equally disappointing. Talk about having a 'goldmine' and not knowing how to 'mine it' !!!\n\nThere has been a recent, significant decline of users on this site as well. I'm talking about 'post election' numbers only . Even well after the elections, this site was 'rockin'. I believe many, many users got fed-up with the 'reporting sytem' and it's 'blind enforcement'. Again, go back to having a 'goldmine' and not knowing how to 'mine it' !!!\n\nThis topic is worthy of Full View by all Y/A users. Perhaps you should post this in the 'forum', and encourage all users to respond. Yahoo does recognize 'one thing'. And the 'one thing' is NUMBERS !!!!\n\nFeel free to email me,, if you plan on posting this in the 'forum'. I'll gladly respond. Thank you for addressing this issue!!!	Politics & Government
question_title: Hasn't Bush simultaneously taken on the powers of a wartime president re Al Qaeda and yet said the Geneva...

[SEP] best_answer: WE are a signatory nation in the Geneva Conventions, and reading them, they apply not just to us, but anybody we fight against...pretty much so long as they openly carry a weapon and shoot at us.  Rounding up the local apple salesman of some Afghan village because the local peach salesman took $20 to tip off the local police does NOT make him a terrorist.  It makes us look very stupid for holding him for 4 years.\n\nThough I'm sure there's 3 or 4 really dangerous guys in Gitmo...TRIAL THEM and LOCK THEM UP FOR REAL.

question_title: Is Muslim/Islam bashing becoming highly fashionable these days? My my, it seems Muslim or Islam bashing is? [SEP] question_content: ..common place in the West these days. \nYes, it is true that a handful characters who happened to be "muslims" have done evil things in the past, hence it seems to be OK to demonise all muslims. \n\nMuslims have only one problem. They have no quarell with the europeans, or Americans. They feel that their comrades in Palestine have been  marginalised, kicked out of their land, tortured, murdered by the Israelis, and the West has for some reason turned a blind eye. It is this injustice that the vast majority of muslms are angry with.\n\nMuslims have been living without any problem whatsoever in much of Europe in the last century, but recently eveything they do seems to attract the attention of the Europeans and the "Christians" living in these countries. It is shocking when dignified people in the Christian world (like the Pope) joins his country men to sneer at & talk about a handful of nikab wearing muslim women, -- dont u think perhaps we said ENOUGH to this shameful Muslim bashing? [SEP] best_answer: People love to hate.

question_title: i live in michigan, can my employer not accept a doctors note to excuse an absence? [SEP] question_content: when i was hired my employer accepted doctors notes as an excuse for absence.  I have been there for 2 years and now they are trying to get me to sign this paper saying doctors notes are not accepted for excuse of absence.  They only give you 3.33 hours of sick time a month.  The paper says that they will terminate if you do not work your required number of hours even if you have a note from a doctor saying you were ill.  Now i thought they had to accept this because the doctor confirms you were ill.  I need help before i sign this paper because you can't control if you get the flu or something.  Am i supposed to go to work sick.  Basically is this legal? [SEP] best_answer: Yes. You failed to mention your employer. Not everything in Michigan is unionized. \n\n3.3 hours per month is really pretty stingy, but, considering most employers carry it forward, and into the non-flu season, and into the rest of the calendar year- it does add up....\n\nYou are always free to take your services elsewhere....correct?\n\nMichigan is not a service sector state, many of our citizens are not easily bullshitted, and some of us actually know and understand real economics, and, we also know that production is the real source of any growing wealth. Refute that promise to the Cbanking terms of downhill desguises.  \n\nSocialism, and communistic thoughts are at constant odds with real freedom. Certain legalities are up to the employer and the contract, and unto the employee to read. Providing said employer he/she has not broken any state or Constitutional liberties in the process.\n\nThe globalized work force is separating many false pretensions...more and more average American citizens are finally realizing who actually runs the big show and controls their worth with inflation/deflation/interest rates.\n\nI have no need to sidetrack myself and go there tonight.\n\nYou probably work for a smaller employer, if you need more time - then simply ask, and make it back up later when you are A1 healthy again. You must be valuable to them, and they will see that... right?\n\nTakecare, and be well.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why can people not debate this intellectually? [SEP] question_content: Why do all the supporters of illegal immigrants throw around all kinds of useless propaganda like we are all immigrants, or this is a smoke screen for(name your demon), or they just want a better life? Why can they not come up with anything other than saying that they work hard, as if that is their saving grace? Everything else they through around is baseless and useless in todays world. You say we NEED illegal immigrants, and I ask for some empirical evidence PROVING that. Notice the word illegal, so you don't get confused with illegal and legal immigrants. [SEP] best_answer: I am a real liberal rather than the usual anti-conservative and I am completely against illegal immigration.\n\nPeople are coming across the border (not just from Mexico and Latin America, but from Asia and Eastern Europe; not just in sweat shops but in sex industry as well) illegally because they are being recruited by unscrupulous employers to circumvent the idea of free market economics. If the demand for workers is greater than the willingness of the indigenous labor supply to settle for the money offered then wages are supposed to go up. Instead, a black market worker is smuggled into the country, often at great physical peril, and then is kept at a job which would be illegal because the hours are too long and the environment is too unsafe by the threat of deportation or physical intimidation and the worker cannot seek redress because he must remain secretive. This is BAD for America.\n\nHowever, and I am sure you will not like this, I fear that if the War in Iraq were going better we would not be debating this issue right now. The economy has been in the tank for almost five years, and illegal immigration has been a non-issue until six months before a major election when the party in power is seen as being weak. Maybe that is a smoke screen, maybe it's just a coincidence.	Politics & Government

Wade gave a woman the right to suck a baby into a sink, ripping it from limb to limb.  \n\nThe 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote.\n\nNote to tulaksam: Less than 5% of all abortions are due to rape or the health of the mother.  All other abortions (including those conceived via incest) are abortions of convenience.  If women are so strong why can't they say "no" to sex when they do not want to carry the baby to full term?  If they get pregnant and don't want the baby, why are they not strong enough to give it up for adoption?  Roe v Wade will be overturned, because it is based on an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution. Abortion is an issue for each state to decide.  It is not a federal issue.  That is why it will be overturned.	Politics & Government

question_title: How do you change your drivers license number? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You cannot.  It is a uniquely identifiable number that actually incorporates some of your vital statistics into it.  They include your month of birth, state of birth, year of birth, sex, and first digit of your last name.  If you know what to look for you can tell a lot about a person from their driver's license number.  Bottom line - you cannot change your DL number without committing perjury (lying under oath) in most states, or without violating state statutes about providing false information on a DL application.  However, if you absolutely HAD to do it, you'd have to start with a new name and a new (probably fake) birth certificate.  Good luck getting that crap.	Politics & Government

question_title: why is it that our government thinks korea is going to fire a missle on us? [SEP] question_content: We are in the 21st century, why is everyone so over paranoid [SEP] best_answer: North Korea is a viable and potential aggressor. Under Kim's leadership, the government remains hostile and very anti-US. Some believe it is a device to attract attention and generous support from countries to just stand-down. They issued booklets warning citizens to prepare for a US invasion so is it a bluff? With missiles capable of reaching America and every major city in China, Japan and other areas it would seem to be a major gamble to doubt them and not be prepared. I do think that the US over-reacts in some places and sees shadows that don't exist but we shan't have the luxury of Paul Revere riding about to tell us the North Koreans are coming.

question_title: What does a CASA volunteer do and do they require training? [SEP] question_content: CASA is court appointed special advocate. [SEP] best_answer: Each year over 500,000 children in the United States are thrust into court through no fault of their own. Some are victims of violence, psychological torment or sexual abuse. Others have been neglected or even abandoned by their own parents. Most of them are frightened and confused. \n\nIn many cases these children become victims a second time in an overburdened child welfare system that cannot pay close attention to each child whose life is in its hands. \n\nOften these children also become victims of this country's overburdened child welfare system - a complex network of lawyers, social workers and judges who frequently are too overburdened to give thorough, detailed attention to each child who comes before them. \n\nThat's where CASA comes in. Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) are trained volunteer community members who are appointed by a judge to advocate, on a one-to-one basis, for a child who has been removed from home due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment. The volunteer gets to know the child and then lets the judge and others in the child welfare system know the child's perspective and the child's needs.	Politics & Government

The person is already intoxicated and doesn't know that his drink has being spike. He then kidnaps a woman, forces her into the truck of his car, proceeds to leave the area only to swerve from hitting 3 drunks and run into the concrete barrier. The impact of the crash casuing the victim to sustain a serious head injury and lapse into a deep deathlike coma. The suspects proceeds to take the victim to a secluded park and have sexual intercourse with her. The victim eventaully recover and the suspect is charged with kidnapping, sexual assault and attempted murder. How does the drug LSD affect the intoxicated suspect mind frame and how would you rule in this case? [SEP] best_answer: First of WHERE THE HELL did his friend get 10 ML of LSD?\nThe "normal dose" of LSD is about 25–50 micrograms, Which means that 10 ml contains about 1000 doses. [1]\nEven though it is hard to overdose to DEATH on LSD, such a high dose would lead to a collapse and he would not be raping anyone. \n\nSecondly, the rule for involuntary intoxication -- will usually excuse any actions that would not have been committed if the person was not involuntarily intoxicated.\nThe good way to prove this would be for a man to get evidence that he was drunk before a number of times and never hurt anyone. And therefore it was an IMMENSE dose of LSD that make him do it and not alcohol, and thus he is not responsible.[2]	Politics & Government

question_title: Can we get sick after kissing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Missed parties. Postponed exams. Sitting out a season of team sports. And loneliness. These are a few of the ways that scourge of high school and college students known as "mono" can affect your life. \n\nThe disease whose medical name is infectious mononucleosis is most common in people 10 to 35 years old, with its peak incidence in those 15 to 17 years old. Only 50 people out of 100,000 in the general population get mono, but it strikes as many as 2 out of 1,000 teens and twenty-somethings, especially those in high school, college, and the military. While mono is not usually considered a serious illness, it may have serious complications. Without a doubt your lifestyle will change for a few months. \n\nYou've probably heard people call mono the "kissing disease." But if your social life is in a slump, you may wonder, "How did I get this 'kissing disease' when I haven't kissed anyone romantically recently?" \n\nHere's how. Mono is usually transmitted though saliva and mucus--which is where the "kissing disease" nickname comes from. But the kissing or close contact that transmits the disease doesn't happen right before you get sick. The virus that causes mono has a long incubation period: 30 to 50 days from the time you're exposed to it to the time you get sick. In addition, the virus can be transmitted in other ways, such as sipping from the same straw or glass as an infected person--or even being close when the person coughs or sneezes. Also, some people can have the virus in their systems without ever having symptoms and you can still catch it from them. \n\nTwo viruses can cause mono: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Both viruses are in the herpes family, whose other members include viruses responsible for cold sores and chickenpox. \n\nEBV causes 85 percent of mono cases. About half of all children are infected with EBV before they're 5, but at that young age, it usually doesn't cause any symptoms. If you don't become infected with EBV until you're a teen or older, you're more likely to develop mono symptoms. After you're infected, the virus stays with you for life, but usually doesn't cause any additional symptoms. Still, every now and then you may produce viral particles in your saliva that can transmit the virus to other people, even though you feel perfectly fine. By age 40, 85 to 90 percent of Americans have EBV antibodies, indicating they have the virus in their systems and are immune to further EBV infection. \n\nCMV is also a very common virus. About 85 percent of the U.S. population is infected with it by the time they reach adulthood. As with EBV, CMV is frequently symptomless, and mono most often results when infection occurs in the teens and 20s. Sore throat is less common in people who have CMV mono than in those infected with EBV. \n\nAs another one of its nicknames--glandular fever--implies, perhaps the most distinguishing mono symptom is enlarged glands or lymph nodes, especially in the neck, but also in the armpit and groin. \n\nAnother common mono symptom is fever. A temperature as high as 39.5 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) is not uncommon. Other symptoms include a tired achy feeling, appetite loss, white patches on the back of the throat, and tonsillitis. \n\n"My tonsils got so swollen they were touching each other in back," says Heidi Palombo of Annandale, Va., who had mono when she was a senior in college. She recalls her throat being "so hot and swollen that the only thing that felt good was ice water." \n\nCold drinks and frozen desserts are both ways to relieve sore throat symptoms. Doctors also recommend gargling with saltwater (about half a teaspoon salt to 8 ounces of warm water) and sucking on throat lozenges available over the counter in pharmacies and other stores. If throat or tonsils are infected, a throat culture should be taken so the doctor can	Health

One simple method is to ask yourself if the statement is also true of sexual intercourse. When you're masturbating, your body only knows it's getting sexually stimulated; it doesn't know by what means. So, for instance, if the question is whether or not masturbation causes acne, think of it this way: If it did, intercourse would also cause acne. In fact, neither masturbation nor intercourse cause acne.\n\nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair to grow on your palms.\nFACT:\nHow many people with hair on their palms have you seen?  \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair loss, chronic fatigue, and other problems.\nFACT:\nInternet scam artists have tried to invent a concept called "overmasturbation," insisting that you have to buy their expensive herbal pills in order to counteract the effect of masturbating more than a couple of times per week. But the pills have absolutely no effect — and masturbating once or twice a day will not make your hair fall out, or cause anything else they claim.\nMYTH:\nMasturbation is bad for your eyesight. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not affect eyesight. This myth probably originated because boys often start having to wear glasses at about the same age they start masturbating. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your penis to stop growing (or) to get bigger. \nFACT:\nMasturbation has no effect on penis size whatsoever. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your testicles to shrink.\nFACT:\nAbsolutely false! It is true that if you're highly aroused, your testicles become engorged with blood and may appear slightly larger and heavier, and that masturbating will make them revert to normal. But they will absolutely not be any smaller than after the last time you masturbated. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes acne. \nFACT:\nIt doesn't cause acne. Like the eyesight myth, this is a case of two things that happen at the same time, even though one doesn't cause the other. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes sexually transmitted diseases. \nFACT:\nHello? "Sexually transmitted" means from one person to another. You can't give yourself a sexually transmitted disease! \nMYTH:\nIf you masturbate too much, you'll run out of semen and become sterile. \nFACT:\nSemen is a fully renewable resource. When you ejaculate semen, your body simply makes more — the same way your body makes more saliva after you spit. \nMYTH:\nPeople can tell whether you masturbate by how your penis looks. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not change the appearance of your penis. (It does tend to cause an erection, but that usually goes away when you're finished.) \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nMasturbation Frequency:\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1.html#mastfreq\n\nHow often does the average male masturbate?\nIt depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers — maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate — even happily married men.\n\nI think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?\nIt is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/addict.html).\n\nHow can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?\nIt's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it. We thin	Health
question_title: Is this healthy? [SEP] question_content: I eat 5-6 small meals every day.\n\n1. non falt milk\n2. one order of pork dumplings (4 pieces=120 calories i think)\n3. mango shake/juice/smoothie\n4. yogurt\n5. apple\n6. 2-3 servings of vegetables\n\nIs this healthy? Too little? I'm on a diet and I'm not even starving that much because of the things that I eat above! Is it healthy or not? If not, then what else do I have to put in my diet? Will these foods make me slimmer? (I exercise) [SEP] best_answer: The diet is not bad FOR AWHILE, but I'd encourage you to be taking a high quality multivitamin to make sure you are getting the nutrients you need. \n\nI'm a big advocate of a green-source type supplement...something made from fruits and vegetables (no calories...don't worry), rather than a synthetic vitamin. Such supplements provide not only the macronutrients you need, but also the lesser known micronutrients to help with absorption and utilization. There are many types out there. I have used Juice Plus and am now using Nanogreens.\n\nEdit: I encourage you to ignore the answer above mine...you need the calories and nutrition from the shake given how restricted your diet is. Drinking extra water is certainly good however.	Health

Only you know what's normal for your body. If this is unusual, go see your doctor. \n\nRegardless of the response you get to this question, there's no way to tell if your symptoms are caused by the same thing as whoever responds to your question.

[SEP] best_answer: I don't care if it's ICU or the ER, everyone receiving health care today REQUIRES AN ADVOCATE!!!!.  ESPECIALLY if the patient is unable to monitor his/her own treatment, or easily voice concerns.\n\nUnless you're proving to be disruptive, i.e. loud, interrupting to staff, agitating patient, a threat of any kind to patient(s) or staff, there is no cause to require you to leave.\n\nOften, nurses (staff) appreciate a family member who can be of assistance - their loads are filled to the brim.

question_title: is there any treatment for spinal cord injury patients. for complete recovery? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I didn't have a spinal cord injury, but I had a brain injury that included the occipital lobe and the frontal lobe, and the  brain tissue between the two. I was in a coma for six weeks and rehab for the following six months, every day. \nIt was very difficult, I had to learn how to breathe, hold my head up, open my mouth, make sounds, stand, walk with a walker, walk with crutches, talk, write, count, make coherent sentences, add and subtract numbers - you get the idea. It was hard, but I did it, and went back to college that fall. I had to learn to drive again, date again, study again, and I graduated with honors. Do you know how hard I had to work for that?\nIt's been nine years, after trying so hard to get my life back, I'm getting there. I am a personal trainer and a massage therapist.

question_title: Dental Intruding? [SEP] question_content: I'd like to hear from someone who's had this done, or from dentist-types who know what it is.  I've tried googling it, but they're either complete misses or I don't understand a word they say.\n\nMy dentist has recommended that I tell my orthodontist to give me this type of treatment.  She wants to shove my two front teeth up higher to (I assume) help compensate for the bone loss in one of them.\n\nI'd like to know more about the procedure.  I may not be using the word correctly...... [SEP] best_answer: Intruding does exhist, although it is not alway successfull.  FIrst, the source of the bone loss much be discovered, and eliminated.  If it is a brushing/ flossing problem, get the hygienist to teach you the proper method.  If it is a perio pocket, that a toothbrush and floss can not reach, then 3 month dental visits should be sceduled to keep the pocket clean as well an arestin or other antibiotic should be placed into the pocket.  If you are sure the source that caused the origional bone loss is no longer there - then intrusion can provide assistance, but not the solution.  Intrustion is going to make the tooth shorter, and may cause additional bone loss.  It is somewhat unpredictable.   I would talk to an oral surgeon about a bone graft or perio chip to grow new bone.\n\nGood luck!	Health

question_title: Contraception and constant bleeding! Help!? [SEP] question_content: I had the coil put in 6months ago and have bled for most of the time!I'm lucky if I get a break for 1 or 2 weeks, then I bleed for at least another 4 weeks! Docs say just my body getting used to the coil! Also got a smell coming from down there now! Wash regularly, don't sleep around, been checked for bacterial infection, no discharge! Need help! xxx [SEP] best_answer: Birth control is really such a hit and miss.  It can be an unique experience for each person.  The person who posted before me said she is very happy with the Depo shot.  One Depo shot caused me to bleed for six months straight.  It was bad enough that I had to have regular blood tests to check for anemia.  I went back on the pill and did fine. One of my girlfriends has problems on the pill, but she loves her IUD.  Another friend had problems with her IUD, and is now using condoms.  The point is, not every contraception method works for everybody.  Sometimes you have to try them, and if they are not right for you, you try something else.\nIf you feel like your GYN is not taking your concerns seriously, by all means, change doctors.    I am assuming you have researched your particular coil on line.  If you haven't that is a great way to start.  Is this a normal side effect?  Good luck and don't give up.  I know it is frustrating, and a pain in the as*, but eventually you will find a method right for you.....	Health

However menstrual blood is the lining of the uterus that builds up over the course of a woman's monthly cycle and is not really comparable.  Besides, the amount of blood we lose each month is pretty minimal even though it seems like a lot.	Health

Will I overtrain my shoulders hitting the punching bag about twice a week. what kinds of shoulder exercises should I do?  I dont know the names of these exercises so can someone explain them to me? [SEP] best_answer: you should strength train 3 days a week, alternate the days to give your muscles a day of rest.  Cardio can be done everyday.  On the day you strength train do cardo after.  The muscles are warm and the cardio will seem easier.  I would only do the punching bag on the days I lift for shoulders, back, chest, and arms.

My body isn't tired but I keep breathing really hard when running and then my head starts pounding. I love to run but I can go for more than a quater mile without feeliing like my head will explode. help! [SEP] best_answer: I used to have the same problem, but while visiting my aunt in Chicago... I was out for a run and was going to meet my mom at the local Starbucks. She noticed how I was breathing and gave me some pointers...make sure that u are breathing IN through your nose and OUT through your mouth. Take big breaths in with your nose and the same amount out with your mouth. If you practice this it will become 2nd nature and you won't even have to worry about it. The reason your head is pounded is because it is not getting enough oxygen so it has to work harder. Make sure that you are getting enough air. also make sure that you aren't running hard. Your goal is to try to not hear much of a sound when your feet touch the ground- it should be a light movement. And with your arms don't swing them in front of your body, and have them cross paths, because this takes more energy. Instead, have your arms swinging to the side in controlled motions this helps break wind resistance and makes it easier to run and it takes less energy enabling you to run faster. And practice all of these techniques so that it becomes easier and you will run faster and farther than ever! Good luck!	Health

They will be your ... "Bible", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have "low fat" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle "burn". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck	Health

question_title: i have a cousin who is a professional bum-are you? [SEP] question_content: definition: sitting and lying down with some minimal chores, no job,lives at home with parents,eats and lives on their expences. a total freeloader! [SEP] best_answer: "professional bum is an oxymoron" Calling some one a bum because he does'nt work, makes thing worse. There are far more people in the world then there are jobs. You cant expect everyone to have a job, because as soon as somebody gets hired, that job is unavailable for everybody else. Many people feel that not working is immoral, It was,thousands of years ago when everybody in a tribe had to do his share of the work, or they would'nt have enough food, but now a few percent of the population can produce enough food to feed everyone. Its not hard to make enough of something now, the challenge is to sell it. In America most of the real work is done by machines, women, and people who are not U.S. citizens, including people who make things for us overseas. We dont need people to do more work. Most american companies have too many employees, and can increase profits by laying off redundant workers. Yes, there are want ads,and there are jobs available, but they're not going to hire a bum when they can hire someone who gets his work done. If there was a job sharing program where you would share your job with an unemployed person, and you each worked every other day and you each got half of your salary. would you participate? Perhaps "professional bum" is a term that means an unemployed man who will never get a job and does'nt look for one. Bums believe that nobody wants them. They get this idea when they get fired from jobs, and they dont succeed in getting another job. To stop being a bum, a man must believe that he is'nt really a bum, and there is a job somewhere that is easy enough that he can do it, and someone who will want him as an employee. He must believe in himself, or nobody else will. He needs a family that does'nt perceive him as a bum, or acts like they dont.	Health
question_title: Can using a vibrator too much cause it to be harder to climax with a partner? [SEP] question_content: I heard if you use a vibrator to much it makes it harder to acheive climax with manual stimulation. Has anyone experienced this problem? [SEP] best_answer: There has not been any credible research on this phenomenon.  However, we have heard health care professionals "warn their patients" of the horrible dangers of the vibrator, but have been unable to find any evidence based research to back up their words of caution. If a woman misuses a vibrator by holding it directly on the clitoris for an extended period of time, she may temporarily lose sensation (like when your leg falls asleep) but the sensation will return.   Some doctors may recommend that their patients should avoid over-using a vibrator, because they don’t feel comfortable with the ins and outs of using bedroom accessories for pleasure.  Even after checking with The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, they have not found evidence that vibrators cause nerve damage.\n\nWhat some women may notice is that the use of a vibrator may become monotonous.  Just like with any other pleasurable act, if you do the same thing over and over again it may not be as effective.  Just like when the missionary position may have been enough for you and your partner at the beginning of your relationship, after some time passed you may have wanted to “spice things up.”  If this is the case, maybe try a different type of vibrator.  If you have been using a bullet consistently and it isn’t having the same effect, try one with different textures, vibrations, or a vibrator that has rotating beads as well.  Maybe pair your vibrator or bullet with a heightener like Ex-T-Cee to add to the sensation you are feeling.  Remember that the human body can get used to a certain sensation or activity, so keep changing things up to maximize your pleasure!	Health
question_title: What's your reason for living? [SEP] question_content: I am depressed(diagnosed with chronic depression whith major depressive episodes).  I have been since I was 12, and while most of the time I don't want to die, I don't really want to live either.  I don't see the point; I have no reason to drag myself out of bed other then sheer stubborness.  So I'm asking all of you folks, what is it that keeps you going?  Maybe it'll help me find my inspiration. [SEP] best_answer: I live for myself and the people I love... Going through most of my life, I never felt love. Oh, I told plenty of people I loved them and of course they said it back. Though I did not feel it, it was like something alien to me... So I fell into a deep depression, barely eating, not talking to anyone, just sort of floating through my life with a glazed look on my face. Then my nephew was born and I ended up having to raise him for a year, myself. I finally felt that love for something other than myself, I loved my nephew so much that it opened the way for me to love others.\n\nGranted, I still don't feel that sort of love from my family but I now love three people. THREE PEOPLE, one of which I am trying to get involved with. So, I suppose I live for love really... As corny as that sounds. I want the chance to be able to love as many people as I can now, within reason. lol	Health

question_title: How do you use a tampon? I'm serious? [SEP] question_content: I've always used pads, but this year I want 2 change. [SEP] best_answer: You may be worried and nervous about using your first tampon. Talk to your mom or a friend who has used tampons. It is important to first learn how to use a tampon and then, just relax! The more you relax, the easier the insertion will be. When you are nervous, your muscles tense up, making insertion even harder. For your first time, you may want to try using a tampon when your menstrual flow is heavy; this should allow the tampon to glide in more easily. Choose the smallest size tampon for the first time. By following these simple guidelines, and those that come with your package of tampons, your first experience with tampons should be easy.\n\nSit or stand in a comfortable position. Some women prefer to place one leg on the toilet seat or tub, while others prefer to squat down. After you find a position that is most comfortable for you, hold the tampon with the fingers that you write with. Hold the middle of the tampon, at the spot where the smaller, inner tube inserts into the larger, outer tube. Make sure the string is visible and pointing away from your body.\n\n\nWith your other hand, open the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) and position the tampon in the vaginal opening.\n\n\nGently push the tampon into the opening, aiming for the small of your back. Stop when your fingers touch your body and the applicator, or outer tube, is completely inside the vagina.\n\n\nOnce the applicator or outer tube is inside of you, use your index finger to push the inner tube (the tube where the removal string is connected) through the outer tube.\n\n\nOnce the inner tube is all the way in, use your thumb and middle finger to remove the applicator or outer tube. Make sure that the string hangs outside of the vaginal opening. Later, when you are ready to remove the tampon, hold the string and gently pull it downward until the entire tampon is out. \nIf the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. If you feel uncomfortable in any way, you may have inserted the tampon incorrectly or the tampon may not be placed far enough into the vagina. If this happens, just remove the tampon and start again with a new tampon. Remember that practice makes perfect. If you don't get it on the first try, your second try will most likely be successful. Instead of getting frustrated and giving up, relax and try again!	Health

[SEP] best_answer: The only real benefit to marriage is tax relief. The government allows for more tax credit for married couples. The government views marriage as a business venture. That's why marriage certificates in most states have the seal of the treasurer on them.\n\nFor the majority of women the benefits are obvious: Child support and alimony. \n\nFor most men, there are no benefits.\n\nIf you really care about some one and truly love them you'll sign a pre-nuptial. It will make sure that the marriage is entered and, if it comes to it, exited on good terms.	Health

One is her roommate whom Ive known for almost as long is suddenly fed up with me. Shes one of those people that complain about her problems and makes everything a big problem and no matter how much my gf and I help her, she needs more help the next day. For example, she expects us to greet her when she gets home, but she doesn't even close to the same to us. As this progresses, my gf and I had a secret dislike for her needs.\n\nConversely, she starts disliking us because we're a couple (she's not) and she thinks I'm whiny (the only person to say so in my life) and she feels distant from my gf probably because she isn't constantly taking care of her. As it is, I don't live with my gf, only spend nights there.

What would you do?\n\nI know how I feel, but I'd like perspectives from both guys and girls. [SEP] best_answer: From a professional standpoint there are some general concerns about partying after office hours.\nA)Drinking and driving\nB) Maintaining a professional, yet friendly demeanor - that means in the office or out of the office. One can hardly be taken seriously if they are "one way" at the office and a bozo "away" from the office. A restaurant might have been a better choice than just out for "drinks."  Loose lips sink ships. Some people simply cannot keep their mouths shut when they have a couple or more drinks and the dirt starts flying - that is where it can possibly jeopardize careers. Hopefully, she's a very sensible person and will maintain a certain level of decorum while out. \n\nIf your marriage is good, there is very little risk she'll be in the sheets with anyone else.  \n\nMaybe next weekend you could pay her a visit and all of you go out for dinner and meet the group.

Did he tell you everyone he slept with...and did you really care. Well, except for sympathizing with you, which he certainly should...being molested is not a nice picture, as you well know, he has nothing to stick his nose into here. He is, in my opinion, crossing over a line that cannot be turned back on..in fact, I would seriously consider divorce, and I rarely tell that to anyone here...In fact, I am the first to say work it out...but he is accusing you of something that is a horror story to you.

[SEP] best_answer: You obviously really like this girl, and if you want her back you should tell her. The worst she can say is 'no' but if you never ask her you will never know. I really think you should try talking to her. Be completly honest, first of all ask if you can talk to her for a bit and then explain to her your reasons for why you broke up with her and how you have changed your mind and you would like to go out with her again, say things like she has a really good sense of humor and a great personality. Complement her but don't over do it because she will know you are being false. Hopefully she will listen to what you have to say and reconsider going out with you again. If not, don't worry, try and stay friends with her, tell her you want to be friends. Most importantly, tell her how you feel, if you don't, you will never know her response.

I don't mind playing, but after awhile, it seems as if anyone who plays doesn't really care to take it anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about you shouldn't be answering this question. [SEP] best_answer: I believe I know what you're talking about and it's sad that you and other people have to refer to love/romance/sex as "the game".  I don't like playing games when it comes to my heart and I refuse to play them.  That's why I don't follow specific rules when trying to meet people.  I don't waste my time on certain pick up lines.  I try to look good, but I'm not going to change how I like to appear for a woman.  I'm not going to try to act better to impress someone either.  If you are really looking for a relationship with someone, then why do all those stupid things?  Your true self is eventually going to reveal itself in the end anyway and a lot of break-ups happen because people find out months or even years later that they really don't like who the other person "really is".  So yes, I am 28 years old and I've been fed up with the game since I was a little kid.  I started observing B.S. things about relationships and how to start one very early in life.

You run a great risk of being hurt!  :(\n\nOn the other hand....he may, indeed, feel as you do, but may not know how to respond to being inundated with all your emotions. This is a learning time for him...and you too.\n\nHave you ever heard of people that should channel their anger?\n\nWell...this is no different really. Your emotion is love....and it can come flooding and be overwhelming like anger can. So...try and channel it in the right way. Be gentle.....and try and figure out when the right times are to show it. I know....easier said than done. But try.....talk to him. Spend time with him. Be around him. Don't overdo it.....plant the seeds, and hang around and nurture them so they can blossom into a nice, wonderful love for you, and he.      :)\n\nGood luck to you...I hope it all works out for you!

question_title: What is your worst date? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I dressed up nice in heels and a lil skirt. \n\nHe picks me up in a ute loaded with 7 other guys, all drinking beer. I'm thinking, oh we must be going to a party or something....\n\nWRONG!! Instead, he takes us out into the middle of the bush, that's right I said BUSH (forest, woods, jungle whatever they call it where you live)\nwhere they commenced a full out shot-gun assualt on kangaroos. Yep, shooting kangaroos with real-life shot-guns! All of the guys were DRUNK by the way. \n\nTHEN they skinned the half- alive animals in front of me.\n\nOn the way home, with my ears ringing from the gunshots BUT grateful to be alive still, one of his friend keeps rubbing my leg, and I'm like "Get your hands off me." \nMy date then replies "He won't hurt ya, he's just been isolated from women for so long, he wants to feel some soft skin". The fact that they had 4 or 5 guns stopped me from flipping my lid. \nOh yeah, for the record, me and the guy are no longer together!	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do guys change dramatically? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How do you mean? Sounds like you've had some experience of this. Not all guys change dramatically.

question_title: He's a moody person but did I do something or is it just my imagination? [SEP] question_content: This guy at in one of my classes at school.  He's flirted before and has always been hot and cold with me.  But I feel we finally just became semi-friends.  But I haven't seen him in a while and after not seeing him in a couple of days.  When he saw me I gave him a big smile.  He raised his eyebrows and gave me this really weird look, kind of a grouchy look though.  And then today I saw him going to my car and we caught eyes he already had a grouchy expression on his face.  He looked right at me at then looked away.  I said hello and then he said hi.  I have been getting really good grades lately, and he knows this.  I'm in college, but he also does well.  Could it be a jealousy thing though?  What have I done, or is he just moody and this is all my imagination?  I just feel like sometimes he doesn't want to see me.  All I've ever been is nice to him.  What could it be?

question_title: Best friends or? [SEP] question_content: I have been with my guy now for over four years and i know i love him that is not the issue here..I have never really dated before or have never been in love whatsoever. Now my question is this me and him are best friends i can and do talk to him about whatever is bothering me and he is always there to help me out never judging me or anything. I am bipolar/add and he is my rock if you know what i mean. He is wonderful to me and is the biggest help when im down or if im kinda confused or upset. I have alot of family issues im not going to go into here but he is the one that has helped me get some of them worked out to where im able to function alot better now with all of them. Anyhow, how do you know if what you have is TRUE love or just best friends? I mean i know from all the reading on here and all that when you are IN love with someone it is good to also be best friends with them right? How do you know the difference? If your only best friends or if your in love?  Since they close.. [SEP] best_answer: I think that your perception of love has changed over four years. May be you're craving passion, romance those kind of things that mpvies typically portray as love.\nAnd its perfectly alright to want that kind of excitement. \nNot to be preachy but I think you should value what you have...its very hard to come by this kind of rock-solid support. \nAccording to me there are two things you need to work on: \n1) Learn to appreciate the relationship you have. And try to spice it up. Don't look at your boy friend just as a pillar to lean on and a shoulder to cry on. Treat him like someone you love...shower affection, love and romance. Don't just afflict him with your problems. \n2) I think you should also start working on being more independent. Slowly but steadily, try to start solving your problems yourself. that doesnt mean you keep him out of parts of your life that are difficult... for instance if you[ve had a fight with your mom...you could meet him for coffee to cool off and forget about the fight rather than talk about the fight. Small things like that. \nThese two suggested changes will take atleast 6 months to a year. It will change the equation of your relationship from "damsel in distress and knight in shining armour" to a healthy, balanced one. And if your relationship survives the equation change, then you have found what all of us spend years looking for - true love.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do some men lie to other \npeople about having sex with a \nwoman, Knowing they never did? [SEP] question_content: At my place of employment I have had Three men say that they have had sex with. These are people who I see everyday, and never would I had believe that would make up something like that.  I have never and would not ever think of having sex with someone else while I am in my 13 year relationship.  But it shows me that you can not be friends or socialize yourself with certain people.  I just want to know what do they get out of it, that is what I don't understand.

question_title: Why is it when you break up with a woman, she gets angry &  want to hurt you in any way she can? [SEP] question_content: I met a girl and visit her @ her home for a couple of months. We had sex only twice, but it wasn't good to me. So I told I jst wanted to be friends. I know I could have worked it out with her, but I like a freak from the start, not one that has to warm up to me first. I just don't like her sexualy. Now she is MAD. She is doing bogas things. I have been nice about it. She don't know about the sex. [SEP] best_answer: OK most guys on here would just tell you that all chicks are bitches. That's only true sometimes. Some girls have been hurt in the past so when they get hurt there just over it so they take all of emotions out on the last person that hurt them. See, if you just told her you wanted to be friends then she will get mad at you, but what you have to do is just talk to her. Explain to her why you told her that you just wanted to be friends. Plus woman go through a lot, just as much as men. Not more always not less always but there always going through stuff just like all guys are. So just apologize to her and tell her that you didn't mean to hurt her you just like different stuff than her. So eventually she will forgive and will be JUST FRIENDS. \n\n\nI'm only 13 years old,but I know what I'm talking about so you can take my advice or somebody else's but anyway you better do somthing soon.\n\n If you have anymore questions or comment then send me an e-mail\n\nI hope it works out with you and your FRIEND, but remember she's going through stuff just like you are so be considerate and listen to her.

question_title: So how do you use these feminie whiles? [SEP] question_content: I keep trying but i can't do it. [SEP] best_answer: What makes you think you cant do it?  It's about feeling attractive and sexy as a woman and subtly letting it show. If you like a man you are trying to seduce him by acting sexy (but not like a slapper!). Try lots of eye contact with seductive smiling,  laughing at his jokes, touch his arm to emphasive a point, offer him a genuine compliment(that one worked for me!) and speak softly. Looking up at him with doe eyes is usually a winner,Just keep showing interest in the man and he will eventually get the message. Most of all though remember to be yourself.	Family & Relationships

question_title: a question for you girls. what would you do to a woman if she was trying to steal your man? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: hmmmm....that's a hard one in a way because it would depend on whether or not you were VERY SURE that that is what she's trying to do....I guess if she was being blatant about it, I would have a talk with the boyfriend and see if he couldn't possibly talk to her and let her know that he's simply IS NOT available...he's with the one he loves but if this is something he won't go for..I say..tell her yourself....you don't have to be overly overbearing or mean about it ..just let her know that your not giving your man up and that there are names for women like her that try to steal someone else's man.....slut.....pure and simple....let her go for someone who isn't in a relationship at the moment...there are plenty of men out there like that....but of course it's not entirely her fault either especially if she's flaunting it and your man is simply going along with it....he needs to be sat down and you need to have a heart to heart with him...letting him know how badly this makes  you feel and how would he like it if you had some guy all over you and your were just going right along with it??   Honesty is the best thing in a situation like this...your boyfriend needs to be a part of the discussion and decision because all three of you are involved.\nGood Luck!	Family & Relationships

question_title: My friend is dating a 17 year old boy and she is only 14 so do ya think it is wrong? [SEP] question_content: So do you think it is wrong and she iz dearly in luv with him and she was telling me this and i was like there is nothing wrong wit that. But then after i was not so sure. So can ya help me even tho this iz not ma problem? [SEP] best_answer: There is nothing wrong with it, in my opinion. Even with the stagitory (sp?) rape situation (which im sure will come up somewhere)at least in some states, is that it has to be atleast a 5 yr. difference, regaurdless if someone is under 16. Some may say that is wrong with the age difference, but love has no boundaries, and love is love either way. As long as no one is being taken advantage of or used, then I see no problem with this. I mean, they could hypathetically going to the same school with each other, IOW, highschool, so what's the problem in that? My parents are remarried, one is 9 years older than their spouse, the other is 5. But when you are dealing with such a young age, the only thing I could think would be an issue is the maturity levels that may differ, but even then, that does not justify this being "wrong". so in my opinion, the answer is not wrong.

question_title: who was the best tag team of all time? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are many good teams, but if you are going by the long haul, and success over the long haul, it would have to be the Road Warriors.\n\nI thought that the British Bulldogs were amazing, but 3 years as a team doesn't make for a great long term team.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Express is the only other team that I would put up there with the Road Warriors.\n\nThe Hart Foundation, The Killer Bees, The Fabulous Ones, The East West Connection (Adonis/Ventura) were all great teams too, as were the rockers for their time, Demoltion was good, but too much of a remake of the Road Warriors. \n\nIf you are talking about in the past ten years though, it's probably the New Age Outlaws.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My father taught me the most important lesson I ever learned about betting horses. Don't bet the horse, bet the odds board.\n\nExample: If you handicap a horse to win and the horse is even money, forget him, find a better bet, even if you know the even money shot is going to win.\n\nI've been betting horses, and winning, since I was 12, about 42 years ago. This is the best lesson I ever learned.\n\nIt doesn't answer the handicapping question (current form, curren class, current success of connections) but it may help in winning more money, and I think that's what you are looking for.

question_title: Do women have a place in men's football? [SEP] question_content: In light of Mike Newell's comments on Saturday about a woman assistant referee, should women be involved in the top leagues in England? [SEP] best_answer: If they really want to do it and put up with the abuse then why not. I think I understand where Newell is coming from but his mistake was making his feelings public.He only invited all the politically correct and womens groups to heap abuse on him so there was nothing to be gained. Maybe it will get the players to watch the language assuming they have any respect for women.	Sports
question_title: Is it realistic? [SEP] question_content: What prompted this is a response I read from someone else regarding a question concerning belt ranking. In his answer, after listing the belts, he goes on to mention the period of time required between them as deemed necessary by his school in order to be tested for advancement to the next which is 4 months. And if you don't earn it, you don't get it and must wait another 4 months. This, I think, is as it should be.  That being said, I'm not sure what to think sometimes when I encounter indviduals who boast of having attained the rank of 2nd degree black and then proceed to tell me that they accomplished this in 2 years or whatever. It just seems wrong. [SEP] best_answer: I have come to a new understanding of black belt vs. someone who can seriously beat some ass or knows the art.\n\nAnyone can get a black belt... just go buy one for 4$  It would be like you getting ready to hire someone for a NASA engineer position... Would you want to hire someone who went through 4 years at a university and then extra for a masters of Physics?  Or would you want to hire someone with a 2 year degree and an on line masters...   Of course there will be other factors that come into play.... But i think that time has a HUGE part to play with rank.  Its like someone boasting that they have a 4 year on line degree from Devry or some other lame on line school.  And then someone who tells you they have a 4 year degree from a University like Washington or Oregon.  I am gonna take the U of W over devry any day!	Sports

question_title: If your team mate somehow catches your punt without it bouncing off the ground, would it be a converstion? [SEP] question_content: or a change of possesion [SEP] best_answer: Once a ball is punted with a snap from the line of scrimmage, the possesion is changed unless touched by the receiving team.  This holds whether the punting team downs the ball after rolling or catches it on the fly.  The only way that the punting team can re-gain possession is (1) if the returner "muffs" the punt (when the ball hits off of him without him catching it) or (2) the ball in-advertently hits another member of the returning team and then gets recovered by the punting team.  \n\nOf course if the returning team tries to block the punt and misses and in the process knocks over the punter, it results in a 15 yard personal foul which brings an automatic first down with it.\n\nIf it is the kickoff (either at the start of a half or after a score) that whoever ends up with the ball at the end of the play has possession of the ball.\n\nExample: On a kickoff, the ball could be kicked deep to the returning team, they catch the ball and get tackled resulting in their first down at that spot.  BUT, If the kick is popped up short and the kicking team catches the ball, it is THEIR ball, 1st down at the spot that they catch it.  The kicking team cannot advance the ball once they gain possession.	Sports

J.J Reddick eew but wutever. \n\n          I do not think they pick rajon rondo. Sixers are my favorite team so i think they do need a power forward who can rebound the ball and play defense cause that is what they were lacking last season. \n\n              I think they go with Cedric Simmons.  He is great at blocking, Plays great defense and is a great rebounder and is decent at getting to the hole. \n\n               Also there is a 50% chance that they will trade Iverson which I will hate because Iverson has been my favorite player since i was six his rookie year. And they would do terrible without him but anyway if they do that they could get Quincy Douby from Ruckers. Who is an amazing amazing shot. Can dribble and is fast and can pass. \n\n          I still would pick Simmons because theyre starting lineup could look like this.   PG Iverson SG  Willie Green SF   Andre Iguodala PF Cedric Simmons  C  Dalembert\nand have Webber as six man even though he would hate it.	Sports

You will get a great deal of coaching, conditioning and training that will make you a more efficient swimmer, which is really what it is all about.  Swimming faster does you no good if you leave too much energy in the water and do not have the power and speed left for the bike and run.\n\nMaking sure that you are not fighting the water but using it to your advantage is key.  Learn to draft off others, make sure that you are swimming "within your tube" and within your target heart rate.  This will leave you fresh for the remainder of the race.\n\nTwo great sources are www.totalimmersion.com, an excellent resource for learning to swim efficiently, and The Swimming HUB, swimmingscience.blogspot.com.  Both of these sites will give you the head start that you need to start winning those races.	Sports

But in his later years, he wore a strange looking headgear. \n\nYears later, Gavaskar's improvised headgear made its way into a London museum. The expert there picked it up and demanded to know which nut had made bold to sport it. Told that it was a batsman who had scored over 10,000 runs in Test cricket, pat came the chilling diagnosis: "The guy is lucky he was never struck by a red-hard cricket ball on this monstrous headgear. The fellow would have dropped dead on the spot." \n\nhttp://www.sta.uwi.edu/media/releases/2006/images/gavaskar.jpg	Sports

question_title: How do you choose your favorite MLB team? [SEP] question_content: I am from Columbus, Ohio and I am having trouble choosing a favorite team. There are the Reds and Indians but I have never really been a fan. Any advice? [SEP] best_answer: Rules for picking your favorite team:\n\n1) You can only have one favorite team.\n2) once selected you can only change your favorite team under extraordinary circumstances. \n\nNow how do you pick your team?\n\nThe easist and most rational method is to support your hometown team.  You live in Columbus, so you don't really have one, but the Reds and Indians, both being from Ohio warrent consideration.  \n\nAlso, in Columbs you have the Clippers which is the AAA afiliate for the Washington Nationals.  This would be a great option because you can start rooting for these players at a reasonable price while they are promising stars on the come.  And then transfer that right into watching MLB games.\n\nA final way is to look around the league and find a franchise that you think is run well and pick them.  Of course if you do this you must remember rule number 2, there is nothing worse than a bandwagon jumper, to truly be a fan you have to stick with them through the bad times, it makes to good times that much better.  Also remember if you go this route don't choose the Yankees, 'cuz that's like rooting for the house in blackjack.	Sports

question_title: Anyone else think that the Steeler's first touchdown last night was total crap? [SEP] question_content: I'm not a fan of either team- not a sports fan period, but I don't think that should have counted. I'm willing to be proved wrong though. What do y'all think? [SEP] best_answer: All that is required to score a touchdown is for the football to break the imaginary plane at the front edge fo the white line that is the goal line.  Although the quarterback's arm obscured the balled somewhat, the replay made it look like the ball DID "break the plane".  The referees on the field were much closer and had a better view, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOn the other hand, I thought the "pushing off" penalty that negated a Seattle touchdown in the first quarter was bogus.  I don't know if that would have shifted momentum to Seattle or not.	Sports

question_title: when did women suffrage start and end in the usa? [SEP] question_content: what year did women suffrage start and what year did women suffrage end [SEP] best_answer: The struggle for women's suffrage in America began in the 1820s with the writings of Fanny Wright. In her book, Course of Popular Lectures (1829) and in the Free Enquirer Wright not only advocated women being given the vote but the abolition of slavery, free secular education, birth control and more liberal divorce laws. \n\nIn 1893 women got the vote in Colorado, followed by Utah (1896), Idaho (1896), Washington (1910), California (1911), Arizona (1912), Kansas (1912), Oregon (1912), Illinois (1913), Nevada (1914) and Montana (1914). \n\nIn January, 1918, Woodrow Wilson announced that women's suffrage was urgently needed as a "war measure". The House of Representatives passed the federal woman suffrage amendment 274 to 136 but it was opposed in the Senate and was defeated in September 1918. Another attempt in February 1919 also ended in failure. \n\nIn May 1919 the House of Representatives again passed the amendment (304 to 89) and on 4th June 1919 the Senate finally gave in and passed it by 66 to 30. On 26th August 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment was certified by the Secretary of State, when Tennessee, the thirty-sixth and final state needed, signed for ratification.	Education & Reference

What do you think about being a married schoolgirl? [SEP] best_answer: Quite frankly they should wait to get married. This isn't because they aren't able to or aren't mature enough. It is because the pressures that come with a "marriage", even though it is just a piece of paper, could actually split them up. Encourage them to stay together. There is no reason that they can't.

There are no seaports, except at the mouth of the Río Grande, and not many large towns. Generally this land is ranching country. There are only two sizable concentrations of population, the city of Laredo and a cluster of cities near the mouth of the Río Grande. Laredo, with a 2003 population of 197,488, is located on the Mexican border. Through the city is funneled a great deal of traffic and trade between Mexico and the United States. Brownsville, with 156,178 people, is the largest of a belt of cities that dominates the Río Grande Valley from the Gulf Coast to a point 100 km (60 mi) inland.	Education & Reference

question_title: What is Screening Process in Printing Technology all about;Pls Professionals respond.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Take a magnifying glass and look at a printed picture. You will see a lot of dots. That is how shades of gray are made on a printing press. To see this look at a black and white photo in a newspaper.\nAnd colors are made using only 4 colors of ink: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK). Look closely at a magazine cover for that example. Or more easily seen on color comics in the Sunday paper (heavier screening).\nTo print an image, the picture has to be transfered to a inked metal plate that transfers the image to the paper. There is no way to smear the ink in varying thicknesses. It can only make differences in darkness by using the screening technique, which means making the image into a series of dots (A screen). The distance between the dots determines the apparent darkness of the image. (Close together=darker. Far apart=lighter.) This used to be accomplished in the dark room with a camera and a sheet of film with the appropriate sized dots on it. Now it is done by outputting the image to film from computer which performs this function automatically. \nThe "screen size" is dots per inch (dpi) or lines per inch (lpi). Newpapers have faster, lower quality requirements for their product and typically use screens of around 80-100 dpi, while commercial, high end printshops doing 4 color work may use 1200 dpi, or higher screening.

question_title: please someone who knows logarithms please help.? [SEP] question_content: how in the hell do u do a problem like 3^x+4=5^x-1\n\nand\n\n36^x=6^x^2-3\n\npleas  its logarithms and im gonna fail algebra [SEP] best_answer: Well, your first question is 3^(x+4)=5^(x-1).\nWhen you encounter such a problem, the first thing you should do is to apply logarithms (of base 10) to both sides of the equation! So, lg( 3^(x+4) ) = lg( 5^(x-1) ). Now, you can apply some rules involving logarithms and you'll get (lg3)(x+4)=(lg5)(x-1). Note that lg5 and lg3 are constants, and you can remove the brackets through multiplication, collect all the terms with x on one side of the equation and solve! The answer may not be "nice", but nobody said all answers are!\n\nNow, your second question is 36^(x)= 6^(x^2-3).\nEven though I did suggest using logarithms immediately for the previous question, you should take a closer look at this question to see if you can apply any "nice" results. Observe that 36=6^2, so 36^(x)= 6^(2x). So, the question becomes 6^(2x)= 6^(x^2-3). Since we have a common base of 6, we only need to analyze the powers and we have the quadratic equation (x^2)-3=2x. Can you continue from here?\n\nNOTE: For the first question, it is difficult to adopt the method of "finding a common base and equating powers" (like we did for the second question), so we have to use logarithms instead. With more experience, you should be able to know when each method can be used.	Education & Reference

If you had a PC you could choose from dozens of word processors, spreadsheet, etc.  If you looked to shareware the selection grew exponentially.  On the other hand a MAC had one of each application available.  At the time I would enter a store to buy software and find rack after rack of PC programs and half a shelf dedicated to the MAC.  It was like buying an early Ford  automobile, you could have any color as long as it was black.\n\nNow I stay with the PC because of inertia.

question_title: what is the importance of samuel taylor coleridge in literature and what is the special awards he recived.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Coleridge is probably best known for his long narrative poems, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around one's neck, the (mis)quote of "water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink", and the phrase "a sadder but wiser man". Christabel is known for its musical rhythm and language and its Gothic tale.\n\nKubla Khan, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known and loved. It has strange, dreamy imagery and can be read on many levels. The name of Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu comes from the first line of Kubla Khan. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have additional "romantic" aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their "exquisite metrical movement" and "imaginative phrasing."\n\nColeridge's shorter, meditative "conversation poems," however, proved to be the most influential of his work. These include both quiet poems like This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison and Frost at Midnight and also strongly emotional poems like Dejection and The Pains of Sleep. Wordsworth immediately adopted the model of these poems, and used it to compose several of his major poems. Via Wordsworth, the conversation poem became a standard vehicle for English poetic expression, and perhaps the most common approach among modern poets.\n\nsorry,but even i dont have any idea about the awards he receieved...

Try a tutoring program as well, the popular ones are Kaplan and Princeton review but I am pretty sure your college will have a Tutor. Talk to the pre-law adviser at your institution he should be able to give you more information. \n\nThe one thing I have to say is that there is no definite way to study for the LSATs each person has to find the way that's best suited for them.\n\nGood luck!
