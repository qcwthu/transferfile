title: I was an extra in this movie [SEP] content: I got paid $35.00 for 12 hours work. Brad Davis pushed me in the critical student protest scene. I'm the one in the blue sweater.	negative
title: A book for specialists [SEP] content: More than a book it is a collection of papers, not always easy to understand and written in academic language. It could be used as a reference by one who knows already the subject. Not recommended for beginners	negative
title: Didn't fulfill its promise, but I'm glad I read it. [SEP] content: One of the other reviewers perhaps said it best: I really wanted to like this book. As a mid-life motorcyclist (Harley) and pilot, with a penchant for old airplanes and motorcycles, I have long harbored the dream of restoring something really classic; a Harley J, a '32 Ford, a Stearman biplane, etc. So I grabbed the book without a second thought, anticipating a real restoration chronicle. What I got was part soap opera and part Pirsig, with a too-large serving of jobbing out a restoration to various subcontractors, and not enough nuts and bolts. Wish it had been edited bt Tom and Ray Magliozzi (The Tappet Brothers).	negative
title: Read the reviews before you buy [SEP] content: As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could.	negative
title: So so aweful [SEP] content: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.	negative
title: This isn't what I expected [SEP] content: I ordered Onieda flatware to add to my existing set. The pattern is called "Flight". The flatware I received was not quite the same pattern, and the quality of the flatware was cheap and light weight. My original set is nicely weighted and looks very good. I was highly disappointed.	negative
title: Ok, but not great [SEP] content: The book didn't seem to be updated much. I liked the SAT for dummies book better for studying.	negative
title: Big disappointment [SEP] content: I remember how happy I was when I bought this cd several years ago...and how disappointed I'd been afterwards. This cd is just pure crap. I could have never expected something so commercial and bad-written from who I considered (and I know I'm not the only one) the king of r'n'b.Apparently double-up is just as bad as this one, so I've never bought any cd from Robert again.This is really a waste, the guy used to be so talented!	negative
title: Not so good book [SEP] content: This book is not as good as the other I bought. I would not recommend it.It give reader some information but other books are better to read and understand.	negative
title: Worst book ever [SEP] content: I was truly interested when I heard about this book. Part of it takes place in the SF Bay Area where I live. I concerns (I thought) gold coins and Priests Grade, two subjects also of interest.I give it 1 star because there is no 0 stars. It is the worst written book I have ever tried to read. I have tried to force my way thru thinking it would get better. It never does. I tried over and over and over. It is so badly written I had to look at the page numbers to be sure it wasn't bound out of order. I think the other reviews were written by the authors mother and she never read it. GARBAGE !!!!!	negative
title: The Hunter [SEP] content: too creepy to keep reading. knowing there are a sackful of books about the same bad guy convinced me that the hero guy I like in crime novels was not forthcoming.	negative
title: not well made at all [SEP] content: My mom purchased this for my daughter who is 12 months. The velcro on it very sharp and scraped her face, to where it drew blood. Also, one of the dolls feet has no toes sewn but the other one does. The diaper and pants constantly come off. It is a very soft doll excpet for the velcro edges being so sharp. She purchased it from amazon to, not sure if it was a defected doll or what. My daughter plays with it without the clothes on it now. I personally wouldn't spend the money for it, my daughter likes every doll she has just as much as this one.	negative
title: Whiney and chock full of sloppy reasoning [SEP] content: Maas whines for page after nauseating page about how everything bad in the world is a result of capitalism. He stops just short of blaming it for earthquakes and volcanoes. However, he completely ignores the fact that over the past 200 years, capitalism has brought about unimaginable increases in standard of living, longevity, and prosperity for all, while every attempt at socialism has brought about misery, poverty, and death.	negative
title: DIDN'T WORK VERY LONG [SEP] content: I was going to keep looking for this item and reorder it when it became available until I read the review from lady from Louisville, Kentucky. Just like her I had this oven for about three or four months - used it about five times and it just quit heating up. Maybe the manufacturer should look into this. I too, had thought that I may have gotten a dudd until I read her review.Diane -	negative
title: If you buy this its your fault [SEP] content: I love the people that come in here and say the negative posts are all from the same "few people".. lol go check out the star wars galaxies forums and see if we are a vocal minority. Soe spies. Anywho... this game was the best one ive EVER played, hence why i stuck around for a couple years. I had a blast... wish i could tell you it was fun now, but its absolutely abismal.Make your own decision but dont say you werent told... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.	negative
title: Don't Recomend [SEP] content: I disliked the use of language - you can have a good book and not fill it with explicatives. Also the flow was very choppy.I would not recomend wasting your money on this book.	negative
title: Stay back! [SEP] content: Living in a country where stations don't need much power to get good coverage, I figured this might be a good buy. I was wrong, way wrong.Even the weakest of stations step over the transmitter's signal like it wasn't there. I had to resort to tuning slightly off frequency so the FM stations would be tuned out.. and even then performance was only marginal.I'm taking this thing back to the store tomorrow. Not worth it.	negative
title: tired social darwinism [SEP] content: This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages. The characters are one dimensional, the philosophy is half baked, and the plot is does not exist. A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy	negative
title: JAWS OOPS!, YOU DID IT AGAIN. [SEP] content: Jaws the Revenge is not simply a bad movie, but a stupid and a shameful one, a rip-off, andf that's still a surprise, because the film is the fourth in a series that has still served universal pictures for many years, and the movie stars lorraine gary, the wife of the chief executive officer, wasn't there someone in charge that the film has to be at least this bad, I Guess not, because the film would have been called Eminem the Revenge. Rating No Stars.	negative
title: Unreliable [SEP] content: Phone died after two days of operation. Handset would not connect with base. Also, handsets get VERY HOT after being on the charger for a few hours. Returned.	negative
title: Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub [SEP] content: This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed.	negative
title: Waste of Money [SEP] content: I have done 3 experiments from this kit so far and every single one was a flop. I even went to the store and bought new yeast because I thought maybe it was old but it didn't make any difference. I wish I could get my money back for this kit. It was a complete waste of time and money.	negative
title: excelente libro, pesima presentacion [SEP] content: de la mitad en delante hay una exagercion de version y palabras incompletas. compra otra version. se dificulta cpmletmente la lectur y la hce obsoleta	negative
title: Incredibly Noisy [SEP] content: While it does move a good amount of air, the Whisper 60 emits an incredibly loud buzzing noise. The noise can really fill a room and quickly become very annoying. The Whisper AP150 I bought to replace this is much quieter (even quieter than my Whisper 10) and the closest I've seen an air pump get to "silence." This one, however, is quite the opposite.	negative
title: Very poor base design & instructions [SEP] content: Followed directions to the letter. The pole base (mine came as 2 pieces) came apart because the two pieces didn't fit together well. There's no reference point or specific depth mentioned as to how deep the poles should be connected together. So we tamped them as far as we could drive them, and filled both pieces with concrete as instructed. After a few days, the top split from the bottom. Now I have a base filled with concrete and concreted in the ground, and an upper piece filled with concrete and laying on the ground. Worthless. I hope their return & exchange works well. Very poor design & instructions. Buy something else.	negative
title: Not for me [SEP] content: I hate to give low points since I know what it takes to make these films. But somehow I wasn't enthused about this film.	negative
title: Difficulty [SEP] content: Well I have mixed feelings about this headphones. They're in all regards superb for the price unfortunately I about a month after buying my first pair they broke. The left ear went dead. I thought it was just my bad luck so I bought myself another pair and low a behold a little over a month later the same problem. I tried to contact amazon and J Lab to activate my warranty. It has been over a week and I have not gotten a response from either Amazon or J Lab. So I would say avoid this product if you can not because of the product itself but because overall they're for the consumer who likes to throw money away repeatedly.Addendum: I contacted JLAB and they sent me a new pair because I was within the warranty. My opinion of these head phones has increased substantially.	negative
title: AWFUL [SEP] content: The seller themselves were prompt with shipment and great with packaging, but this product was not worth the care the took. We couldn't use the product at all. The holes were not properly drilled to allow any screw keep the product in place in the computer. The plastic is beyond cheap. We have gone back and ordered a proper aluminum bracket and hope to have better luck. Please beware when purchasing this item!	negative
title: had to return it [SEP] content: I was delighted with the features and appearance of this watch after I recieved it. I needed to have a couple of links removed from the band (not a small guy...5'8", 220lb. Three separate jewelers were not able to remove the links, so I needed ot return it. Bummer.	negative
title: Lame At Best! [SEP] content: An Elitist List written by someone who in my opinion is far from balanced, who has appeared on Fox News 8 times in the last 20 days promoting this, and not appearing on any other major network due to lack of invitation???I rest my case.Poor Al! Cover material.	negative
title: Missing text/sentences make this annoying to read [SEP] content: I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???	negative
title: Far Different From Other Nelly Tracks [SEP] content: I have listened to a number of Nelly Furtado tracks now and then but her latest single "Maneater" is massively different from all her other offerings. This is the first single released from her brand new album "Loser" and is a vivid revelation of the Canadian female solo artist's versatality and lack of fear to trespass into unaccustomed territories. This song is absolutely sensual and the sexy voice of the singer lends it more than just a shade of wickedness. This track has spend more than a fortnight at the pole position of the UK Singles Chart and in the process becomes the first single of 2006 to accomplish this amazing feat. "Maneater" is a great track and illustrates another new dimension of this female vocalist'd msic-making.	negative
title: good writing unfortunately plagued with misogyny [SEP] content: As someone who generally appreciates good writing, I looked forward to reading this collection. It only left me infuriated. Updike is an amazing writer. He truly knows the art and beauty of the craft. But all of his stories belie his misogyny. Men resent their wives, women are portrayed in one or two negative ways--it ruined the whole book for me. So I switched to Flannery O'Connor instead. Good writing, no misogyny.	negative
title: Silly, Amaturish, "Most Beautiful" typifies poor writing [SEP] content: To suggest these works well or even moderately well written is to confuse the issues we have judged to be important in good writing. Burkowski has an obvious gift for crafting fine sentences, and to construct tales directly from life experience or perceived life experience is a beautiful thing, but not to spend even a moment making any sense of or trying to understand these experiences proves a true lack of insight. Semi-literate six year olds, lost in a chaotic twirl of inchoate thoughts and ramblings are capable of the same. All of this is not even to mention the trite, ridiculous heart that palps pitifully within each of these ill-considered works. Literature is more than this! For those who believe there is genuine meaning in organized human expression for the sake of communication, please do not be midlead by these silly stories.	negative
title: You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed [SEP] content: This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is "standard" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% "standard" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet.	negative
title: I wish I could give it zero stars. [SEP] content: I received this as a birthday present. I first tried making a loaf of honey wheat bread and followed the instructions from the manual. I was happy with how easy it was....I was unhappy with the results. Basically after the cycle was over, I was presented with a soggy brick of half dough/half undercooked bread. It was inedible and I basically wasted a bunch of ingredients. I thought maybe it was just a first time around mistake on my part and decided I'd give it another shot. I made the easiest possible recipe and once again I wasted 4 cups of flour plus all of the other ingredients on a soggy half baked lump of dough that had to go in the trash. I've never had a brand new machine just not work at all. It was really disappointing. If you're thinking of buying this bread maker I urge you not to.	negative
title: Zzzzz [SEP] content: I'm glad people don't write science fiction like this anymore. If they did, I'd be reading westerns instead.The science is terrible, and the characters and plot are even worse. If you want to read good science fiction, look somewhere else. And L. Ron Hubbard had the skill to make even the most incredible action scenes boring.	negative
title: 5 minute treat [SEP] content: The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.	negative
title: Too much talking [SEP] content: You will spend more time hearing biographical anecdotes rather than the actual hands details you may be looking for. Hire a makeup artist.	negative
title: Wow - what imagination [SEP] content: Despite the fact that the witnesses, ballistics, autopsies, and sheriff reports all point to the fact that there were no "Christian martyrs" at columbine, the author tries to get us to swallow the stories anyway, as if we have no other source for information. He claims that the sheriff and media are covering the truth, his "truth" being that there is a war against Christianity (sheriff and media are fighting Jesus). That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale. The good side is that most will realize that this is put out by some who are desperately trying to hang on to their time in the spotlight (and make a little money while they are at it), even if they have to use tragic teen deaths to do so.	negative
title: These are not 18/10 Stainless [SEP] content: I had received 2 sets of this silverware from Bed Bath and Beyond... Sept. 2006.I ordered this set to replace some missing pieces.NOT a matchI read the product description 18/0 and thought it was a typo because further down on the page in the product description it says, " Crafted of durable 18/10 stainless steel and designed to be used on a daily basis"I'd send them back, they are cheap compared to what I had, but my hubby already had thrown them in the dishwasher and we were already using them before I really had a chance to check them out.I could pick them out just by weight alone...	negative
title: If only I could give 0 stars... [SEP] content: Die Trying's debut LP is an extremely sad excuse for music-- every song sounds the same, and to make matters worse, DT sound like a carbon copy of Papa Roach. Yep, DT appear to be playing Papa Roach b-sides (I don't think I need to tell you how bad that is).Die Trying are for those of you who find Papa Roach's sound to be the best thing since sliced bread. If you have taste in music though, give this album a wide berth.	negative
title: Horrible Movie [SEP] content: This movie has made it into the top ten WORST movies ever. Virtually no character development and when there was it was too little too late. The director is applauding I could have directed this movie better drunk. And villianizing the wolf.....jeez THATS a brand new idea. Ugh. If you want to see a movie about real men surviving and connecting man to man I highly recommend The Brotherhood of the Wolf. Don't bother with this movie.	negative
title: Worse than a bad case of diarrhea [SEP] content: Some time ago, I had a really bad case of diarrhea. I thought that after I flushed the toilet, it would be gone forever. Little did I know that Sarah Palin and her handlers were siphoning from the sewage pipes of Los Angeles County and repackaging it into a 'documentary.'Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have made a film with more right-wing propaganda than this piece of garbage.	negative
title: Sorry, I found it boring... [SEP] content: Actually, we read this in our book club and nicknamed it "The Practical Tramp". Outside of a mildly interesting view of the era, the characters weren't all that likeable or relatable.	negative
title: Cables [SEP] content: Connected this cable to my TV and to a HDMI Sat. Receiver. Worked fine to begin with then the colors went crazy and stayed with the wrong color and bad image. Cable was well constructed but something caused problems. When things went funny the audio went off and would not come back on through that cable.	negative
title: Don't waste your time and money- see the Matrix instead [SEP] content: This was a poor movie, not even saved by two, or should I say one and a half action scenes- one where the major fights an Uzi toting baddie and the end fight, with a bug-like tank. The music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as Blade Runner. There are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes AND lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes. Plus, the animation is UGLY. The major looks ugly, the men look poor, and there's a lot of black. While I didn't LOVE the MAtrix, it too was confusing, it made alot more sense than Ghost in the Shell.	negative
title: My movie review [SEP] content: The Amazon quality was excellent, but I did NOT like the movie!! I enjoy the availability of quality new movies provided by Amazon, and thought thi would be a good movie! Not so!!	negative
title: Show, slow, slow... [SEP] content: I've read and enjoyed this author's previous series set in Alaska, so I was really looking forward to a new sleuth and a new setting. However, this novel reads more like a travelogue with a bit of mystery thrown in as an afterthought. There are endless (and I do mean endless) descriptions of the scenery, the flora, the fauna .. and minute-by-minute descriptions of Maxie's daily activities. The suspense, when it occurs, is good, but there just isn't enough of it.	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: I'll PAY you to take my copy away [SEP] content: My wife and I have made a film that we have entitled "The Watching of Blair Witch Project." This new film depicts the two of us trying desperately to get through Blair Witch Project. Included are horrifying scenes of the intense nausea and occasional vomiting caused by the incessant, unnecessary, annoying camera motion throughout Blair Witch. You will also find frightening the utter boredom we experienced, watching three immature teenagers babble and scream and the babble some more for 87 minutes. I highly recommend "The Watching of Blair Witch Project." If you're at all interested in seeing the original film, Blair Witch Project, I'll give you a dollar to take mine far far away from my video library. The used DVD stores won't even take it from me.	negative
title: Bitterly disappointing...... [SEP] content: What can I say, even though I'm for most free expression and have owned adult comics filled with all sorts of stuff for years, I found this one boardering on disgusting and offensive. but that's what really got me annoyed - the "art" is just plain awful, something you'd expect from a 13-year old with too much unsupervised time and clearly an inflated opinion of his talant. Half the time the characters don't even look human - nor anotomicly proportioned nor drawn with any consistancy.There is no interest in any more volumes, overpriced for the thin book that showed up, and I'd advise others to spend your money on something that is a better value and is a better product.	negative
title: worst game ever [SEP] content: Im a big gamer and i have to say i was excited too play this game but after 5 minutes of playing it i regreted buying it. its really hard to understand. making songs on this game sound fun but its really crappy and boring save your money and dont buy this waste of time game	negative
title: Monkey Madness!!! [SEP] content: On a trip to the United States I passed through the lovely town of Portland, Oregon and found this atrocity in a massive used book store. The cover looked funny and entertaining, but all these thoughts were quelled the moment I began to read the book. Nonetheless its sheer stupidity kept me turning the pages.Upon reading this book, I was struck by the ignorance of this author. Not only does this short novel lack any coherent structure, but also is a sour attempt at humor. I can understand that Bush's face looks like a chimp's, but joking about how he has been switched at birth for a "hairless chimpanzee" is unimaginative and banal. My question is, "who cares?" If you want to chastise a political leader, why not do so intelligently, citing resources and using facts to back up your claims. Quotes used out of context don't cut it.A very unhappy read. Overall very disappointing and a waste of your time. Hardly worth a review.-John	negative
title: cr^p [SEP] content: This movie sucks. It's not a Jet Li movie. Jet li has some bs small parts in the movie. Jet Li should have gotten a lot more time in that movie. It's not a good martial arts movie.	negative
title: Absolute Garbage [SEP] content: There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well.	negative
title: Defective [SEP] content: I purchased a total of 8 (2-10 foot & 6-6foot) HMDI cables. The 6 foot cable that we used, didn't work.	negative
title: All The Words Are There... But A Poor Quality Book [SEP] content: This book is acceptable in its words, but the edition is poorly published. I was looking for something to use for writing my Thesis. I am not sure I can (or should) quote this edition for my Thesis.	negative
title: What went wrong? [SEP] content: Whomever designed this was definitely a minimalist. The "slot" for business cards is barely useable, the zippered compartment for the keyboard is a challenge to zip up- hope you're not in a hurry and there is absolutely NO room for an extra stylus, a memory card/stick. Save some $ and look for something else.	negative
title: Falls apart [SEP] content: I love the idea of these but they keep falling apart. I bought 6 total because my original 2 fell apart so often that I wanted to replace them but those fell apart too. My kids are no more than 30 lbs using them.	negative
title: Not Worth The Buy [SEP] content: I bought these strings last week and have already broken string, and other strings show signs of fraying only one week in.	negative
title: Does not live up to the hype. [SEP] content: After reading this book for my October bookclub meeting, I was hard pressed to find out what all the hype about this book was about. While there were aspects of the book that were thought provoking, I failed to see the merit this book supposedly has. I also found myself wondering why his conversation was worth publishing. I found it interesting that on many occasions when the book got boring, which it often did, I could jump around and not lose a beat....that's not saying much. In the end, I just did not like the book very much, again, aspects of it were thought provoking, but all in all I'd not highly reccomend this book. The Road Less Traveled was better.	negative
title: SUPER OUTDATED [SEP] content: This product is very old but durable. To sync it you need to have a super-downgraded active-sync. I used it for personal notes and word documents, but it did not last long. the internet service needed for it is too outdated to use. I would not recommend this product due to its battery life and inability to connect online or to a computer without very downgraded synchronizing tool. Just save your money for a windows phone...	negative
title: Very dated material [SEP] content: The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book.	negative
title: Excellent product so far [SEP] content: Product worked as advertised, no problems, easy to assemble, quite, easy to operate. it kind of bulkly & heavy, but glad to reuse my old dvd drive & now its portable. yes I would recommend this product...	positive
title: fits well [SEP] content: it keep me warm it keep me warm and the colors help to change out the day. It is good to wear to the gym also.	positive
title: Wonderful [SEP] content: Clear directions on how to work at healing your karma at this particular time . I am reading it again - the energy work is great .	positive
title: An incredible album from an incredible woman [SEP] content: She lends these songs a weight that they never had before. I mean, c'mon, you gotta give quite a lot of credit to a woman that can take trite song like "Last Train to Clarksville" and make it mean something to the listener.	positive
title: Great Seat [SEP] content: I searched forever for a good seat for our daughter. I came to this one through reveiews, and I am so glad I got it. It is so easy to put in and switch from our two cars and it fits in my husbands Civic, which I was very glad it did. It is so soft and our daughter loves it. She know can see out the window at what's going on around her. And unlike her baby car seat this one does not move when it is strapped in, which makes me feel SO safe. I don't know how I lived without it. And knowing how well it did with front and side impact ratings is a MAJOR plus. Very glad we have it.	positive
title: I AM CRAZY ABOUT ALBERT HAMMOND'S "YOUR WORLD, MY WORLD" [SEP] content: Ever since 1989 when I listened to the tracks in this wonderful album, I have never heard anything better. I am so crazy about the lyrics. Infact, one particular number,"Now that you're gone away" keeps reminding me of one particular girl I was so much in love with but lost somewhere along the line. My biggest worry is that despite my love for the album, I cannot lay my hands on one. Please anybody who can let me buy one should let me know through my e-mail:fredochu@yahoo.com I am a Nigerian journalist with one of the country's leading national dailies, "Daily Champion". Anybody who lets me have this album would have given me one of the rarest opportunities and collection. Is Albert still alive? If he is, could somebody tell him that he is great. I look forward to having the album and I am prepared to pay the cost of it. Fred Chukwuelobe.	positive
title: BAPs Are Here to Stay! [SEP] content: This book is a great humorous expose! As a older almost retired BAP I can see we successfully passed down our way of life. Only the brand names have changed! I laughed and I gave it as gifts to several in the next generation.	positive
title: 1 GB SanDisk USB drive [SEP] content: This is the best USB drive I have purchased. The speed in which it transfers data is excellent and it is very reliable. Hurray for the 1 GB SanDisk USB flash drive.	positive
title: Eternity..Awesome [SEP] content: Having listened to this CD a number of times, I find it to be delightful. All though the first 3 cuts are a little hard to understand as they are sung so softly, the rest are really great!To me the music has such a cool mix, a sureal sound that kind of just floats along. and lets the mind wander. The instrumentals are very fresh and well played. I find this CD very enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new and exciting listening experience. I can hardly wait for the next CD! I thank you for letting me express my views.J Head	positive
title: On teh Chopping Block [SEP] content: What can I say? I loved On The Chopping Block. Bobby Jaye getsbetter with each book. It was like old home week. Hearing about the lives of cousins Claudia and Joyce, a deeper look into Brady Kincaid and what he's thinking makes me hope that Bobby Jaye's next book will continue with himcoming back to Early and joining the police force. Of couse there is the enigma of Alice Drinker and Brady, can't wait for her to sort that one out.A terrific read. Couldn't put it down. Even stayed up late to finish it. Rock on Bobby Jaye	positive
title: I Liked It [SEP] content: It was a great film, the DVD was sent before I expected it @ my home. I would recommend this film, It's hilarious!	positive
title: Well made [SEP] content: Finding a hose coupling this size was not easy. It is well made and grips tight to the hose. Made of some top quality plastic that takes a pretty good beating. Not exactly rocket science, but when you need a hose coupling in this size, this is a decent product.	positive
title: Very Inspirational,as the truth often is. [SEP] content: This Truth shall set you free.I would recommend this to everyone that is searching for the truth about who we truly areand how we should behave towards each other and ourselves.	positive
title: This CD is simply wonderful! [SEP] content: It takes you places you've never been, and once you start lisening, every bit of stress just floats away. I've bought it twice, but have given it away to loved ones because it's so beautiful. I'm now about to buy it for the third time. Bravo, Beethoven!	positive
title: Versatile and Enduring [SEP] content: If you love to cook, this is an indispensible piece of cookware. From stovetop to oven, this is a high level tool. If you can deal with the weight of cast iron, which is considerable and part of the charm, the enamel cooking surface is perfect for browning and braising, among other things. An excellent product that will last forever if you treat it well (like don't ever use metal utensils which scratch off the enamel).	positive
title: Great! But The other C.D.'s shine too! [SEP] content: This is not the only great C.D. from this artist. Too many people have overloked his other C.D.'s This a a great album though, and my favorites are the title track, "Say your'e wrong" which has a great melody and has been stuck in my head for 20 years, it's that catchy! I even did a varation of the lrycs myself for fun! "Space" is a beauftiul soundscape! Julian, keep making music! You are a gifted songwriter!	positive
title: A Worthy Record [SEP] content: As the child of Polish Holocaust survivors, I read Sara's Children with a great deal of personal interest. The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.	positive
title: An Underrated Guilty Pleasure [SEP] content: Although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. De Palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. Had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.The DVD offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great.	positive
title: Highly Recommended [SEP] content: I've had one of these exact pumps in my Drag car for 15 years and I've just now had to replace it due to normal wear and tear. I highly recommend these pumps for any application.	positive
title: Berganza bloodless? Oh please! [SEP] content: Teresa Berganza is the greatest Carmen ever, period. No other Carmen has ever understood this role better. Berganza lacks nothing in fire. It's just that Carmen is NOT a pre-Pagliacci verismo opera. Regina Resnik recording is SUCH a vulgar affair, that it fully deserves Mario del Monaco as Don Jose. The only Carmen worse than that is Horne's in DG.	positive
title: Remarkable principal dancers [SEP] content: Darcy Bussell and Roberto Bolle must be two of the most beautifully proportioned people on the face of the earth. This is an excellent classic ballet that highlights two extraordinary soloists.	positive
title: The best defense of moral realism [SEP] content: I recommend David O.Brink, _Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics_ (Cambridge UP, 1989). In my judgment it is the best defense of moral realism. Although it does not deal with religion directly it argues for an objective naturalistic ethics--just what theists say that atheists cannot have.Michael Martin	positive
title: upgrading my vhs to dvd. [SEP] content: got this as a joke gift on vhs almost ten years ago. it became a staple at parties with friends instantly. everyone loves it. wore the tape out, had to come here to get the dvd. five stars, easy. highly recommended.	positive
title: pretty good cover [SEP] content: This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.	positive
title: Shiva Has Done It Again [SEP] content: I didn't know what to expect from this DVD until I actually got out on the mat and began to follow the practice. It's a challenging practicethat will build your core - not by doing ab work but by flowing in a graceful practice.Although Shiva guides you through the practice, she encourages you totap into your own flow and add your own movements to the program.The time flew by and I can't wait to do it again.This is a great workout for someone who only has a limited amount of timebut wants to move into the flow.If you are a fan of Shiva Rea, you'll enjoy this work.If you are not yet a fan of Shiva, this DVD compliments her Core Abs and Fluid Power.I rated this DVD five stars. You may want to give it more.Namaste and enjoy it!PS. My goal is to join Shiva on a retreat in the near future. If you aren't on her list, sign up at [...] You'll get her monthly newsletter called Pulse.	positive
title: the best BSC video! [SEP] content: I love books and movies about Christmas. There are so many things going on with the members. Kristy wants a baseball mitt for christmas and has to do chores around the house to pay for half of it(but isn't she supposed to be a millionaire?!); Stacey is sneaking holiday treats because she has diabetes and misses them and Dawn is getting on her case for it and all of them together are volunteering at the hospital and planning a christams party for the sick kids as well as their baby sitting charges. Fun things they did on the side were playing christmas carols on the piano, having a christmas breakfast, the party, seeing santa at the mall and trying to do a secret santa though it was a disaster. A good film.	positive
title: Worked like a Charm [SEP] content: I read reviews that the cards were bogus and were already claimed by the time you get it in the mail. Well, I bought mines and had the physical card delivered, rather than getting the code by email. It worked, and bam. Live for a full year and at cheaper price than what Microsoft charges you for. It's worth investing in Amazon when you need a card. Saves you about $20 each time, maybe even more.	positive
title: Very good, but.... [SEP] content: This movie was very good, but it really threw me off in the beginning when just Ash and Linda drive up to the cabin. Where the hell are the other people? If you just glaze over the first 5 minutes, and skip up to where the last left off, when the Evil gets right up in Ash's face, you should be fine, because the movie is great otherwise from the part of the prologue with Ash and Linda. Especially good is the scene when Ash and the furniture break out laughing together!	positive
title: The Best Ever! [SEP] content: I have tried to find something, anything that would open up my sinuses without taking some drug internally. I have also tried various sprays, both drugs and saline solution, with only moderate relief. After trying this, I am hooked. It has a slight burning sensation when it is first inhaled, but then.... POW! It starts to clear everything out.I am a walking commercial for this product.	positive
title: Logitech Headset [SEP] content: Nice, durable, comfortable headset. You can drop it without breaking it, which is important to me. Only problem was the battery, which pretty much gave out on me after several months. They replaced it and hopefully this one will last longer.I dont like the volume control which goes low every time you turn it on.	positive
title: Good for the money spent [SEP] content: This was worth the money I spent, which was about $3. I would not pay any more than that, it's simply not worth it. The "chain" (really just some plastic beads) is a LOT shorter than I was hoping, but it's easily removable so I will attach a longer chain. It looks authentic enough, and any real Pirates fan will know what it is.	positive
title: Greatest book on the subject in existence!!! [SEP] content: This is the greatest book that my family and I have ever found on the subject of child training! My parents raised me with it and I hope to do the same with my own children. I hope that this book will bring as much blessing to everyone who reads it as it has to my own family.	positive
title: Great, Great, Great! [SEP] content: Yet another great read by Brenda Novak. I Love the Dundee, Idaho books...all of them are great, not one disappointed! I love how characters from the other books mix in and we can hear about them again!	positive
title: Good for Starting a Collection [SEP] content: I have liked almost every recipe that I have tried from this book. I have purchased it twice. Once for myself and once as a gift for a friend. I would recommend it for anyone starting out a vegan kitchen. If you already have loads of vegan cookbooks, you might want to just skip this one and get a specialty cookbook like "The Mediterrean Vegan Kitchen".	positive
title: Excellent and fresh investigation of godly character. [SEP] content: Uncommon Graces is an uncommon book. It is one of those rare offerings that brings together wisdom, insight, biblical integrity, freshness, and creativity, and presents it with clarity and economy. This is no dull laundry list of Christian duties. It will both challenge and excite the reader. It was a real joy!	positive
title: Brother Labeling good as always [SEP] content: I am quite pleased with the TZ231 1/2" Tape. I prefer the 1/2 over the 3/8" tape because it is easier to read as folder labels.	positive
title: essential reference book [SEP] content: Unless your French is perfect, never be without this excellent reference book. Mine has lived next to my computer for the last 15 years, and I use it every day. Ian Joiner, Altiplano Training.	positive
title: Best value speakers [SEP] content: The installation is very easy and the speakers sounded great. I used them to replace some rear surround in wall speakers that deteriorated over time.	positive
title: Getting to know a family next door! [SEP] content: Interesting and engaging would be the two words if you were asked to describe the film in just a second. I believe the film leaves no effort in putting things in the most genuine way possible. The film beautifuly depicts the 70's and its quite believable as you witness the settings, the costumes etc. Reasonable performence from almost everyone in the film, specially Christina Ricci as the curious young girl. She delivers an excellent performence, very genuinely shows a sexual maturity in a young girl. Her friendship with Sandy, her relationship with her father is believable and you can't take your eyes off her. The film will definately grab your attention and you will definately feel you are witnessing a family next door.	positive
title: Good book but what about the others? [SEP] content: Bonnie Bryant has been my favorite author and once again she has out done her self. The book was good but she( Bonnie Bryant) should have the other characters suchas Maxi,Veronica,and other people around the barn? The book is great and I'm definetly going to continue reading the series!	positive
title: Brash [SEP] content: I bought this album because I broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). I didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. I hope I don't break this one but if I do, I'll replace it again.	positive
title: Vampire Diaries continues [SEP] content: to bring interesting, complicated plots with good acting.Every episode answers questions and asks new ones. I just wonder how long such a strong story line and cast can continue.	positive
title: Works on Wii [SEP] content: i got this for my Japanese version of the game..works perfectly in my Wiitried with dk1(us and japenese), dk2(us and japenese), and dk3 (japanese)	positive
title: For indoor workouts [SEP] content: When it is too cold to ride the trainer is perfect for your fix. I love my cycle-ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc. It is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away. The bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals. You will feel confident locked in because it is very stable. The video is a little cheesy and I only looked at mine once or twice when I bought it. The girl and guy are just too darned happy, meanwhile I'm going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them. If you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home. All in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist.	positive
title: The supreme Supreme [SEP] content: Mary Wilson has provided valuable information about the Supremes, but particularly Florence Ballard, showing that Ballard was not a loser, but a very talented woman, frustrated by the world of business. The Supremes have never received the just attention and accolades they deserved. This work provides a personal history behind the top group, not just top female group, of the sixties. A must read for any course on music history.	positive
title: HEELLLOOO [SEP] content: You guys got the pictures for the dachshound and lab switched!It makes it kinda confusing for people who want the lab game...Which would I get if I ordered it!?Which is right the words or the pictures?	positive
title: They have done it again [SEP] content: Flash 5 - Director Games: Where will they go next. Granted the books by epic software and Kris Jamsa are a bit more expensive than the rest of the books, but WELL WORTH IT. I bought the book so that I may see and learn how others are using their creativity to do games. Glad I bought this book. It has a great deal of code and actually walks you through them. Sometimes it can get difficult to follow, but it makes me just that much better when I get through it. I have already been able to sell the concept to a client and used one of the games from the book, changed some of the graphics, just a little of the code and I now have a finished piece that I can sell. Awesome job, awesome book and awesome games.This book is not geared for the starters, but trust me, you will learn a great deal from this book if you are just starting out. I have been working with Macromedia products for a couple of years and am glad I added these two books to my arsenal.	positive
title: Gene Was Special [SEP] content: He healed me twice. Both were nothing short of miraculous. Angels worked through him no doubt. A very special book from a very special man. A must have. His energy comes through it and that is priceless.	positive
title: The test of time [SEP] content: This recording has been measured praised and condemned (well, no one would be foolish enough for that) over time, but is the best reflection of the power and majesty of Mahler's most coherent symphony. The complaints about the sound not measuring up to the modern digital recordings reflects a need for thunder over substance and a bad stereo system. Walter Legge produced recordings that surpass the restrictions of his time and place and the sound on this is magnificent.And the conclusion, where Scwarzkopf's voice floats over the chorus in the Aufstehen is unequaled.	positive
title: Heavenly voice with no equal. [SEP] content: Hayley Westenra's new album "Pure" will affect you deeply if you like uncommonly pleasant singing. It's a "stealth" voice, to be sure, in that it sneaks in sweetly and harmlessly enough, but by album's end you find yourself wondering what just happened. You'll scratch your head and ask, "Did I just experience the finest human voice in all the world?" Then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.So let's just get it out in the open: Hayley Westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and "Pure" will almost make you forget about Norah, Barbra and Celine.As obscure as she is in the USA today, word of mouth about "Pure" will eventually elevate Hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists. Get in on the magic today!	positive
title: The original source of all Federal Reserve System research [SEP] content: This book, originally commissioned by the author Ezra Pound, is discovered upon research to be the source of the majority of present day information on the Federal Reserve Banking System. Compiled from information originally found in the U.S. Library of Congress, the research in this book has been confirmed, validated, and verified by many authors from many different fields of research. A good companion to this book is another book by Mullins entitled "The World Order." That book, and "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" are both books which have sent many people scurrying for cover, and has caused a barage of misleading information which, in itself, has only served to give even more credence and credit to what Mullins says about the subject matter.	positive
title: Welcome to Steve Aylett. [SEP] content: This book will make you laugh, because it is very, very funny. I firmly believe this.	positive
title: excellent book!... [SEP] content: this was an excellent book. it revealed everything that happens on the streets and in the drug game. the book kept your attention from cover to cover. it was definitely a 5 star book. i am an unpublished author, and reading books is my inspiration for writing. this book inspired me to write what i feel and not to hold back anything. i congratulate her, and meow meow productions. be sure to read the book by shannon holmes, called : B-more careful. an excellent book indeed.	positive
title: Awesome book with great detail!!!! [SEP] content: It was a very exciting and was very insane at times like flying through a Mcdonalds as a falcon or something like that. It made me feel like I was right into the action sort of. If you havent read it I really recomend it to be read by you peoples out there. I never Cassie could do all of that by herself because I thought that she might lose it or something. It's also very neat that she saved ax because she never was familiar with the brain surgery that she had done on ax. I hope that everyone gets the chance to do that by them selves just like Cass did. I also repeat it is an awesome book and got very insane sometimes.	positive
title: Religious George [SEP] content: If you want to read a book of about 90% of new material then this is the book...keep in mind it may not be a biography in terms of the man's life or artistic output...it's very much about his religion mainly the India type religion aka yogi's, marehishie? ...and how all that came to be and why it became to be and just how involved George was into all that...brief discussions on the backlash in his involvement and most of all the meaning of his involvement on popular culture as we know it...most people are aware of yoga, chanting, indian religion and 95% of that is the responsibility of George Harrison's involvement...but keep in mind when purchasing this book the book's main focal point is the religious aspect of his lfe...with a very very brief over-view in the beginning chapters.	positive
title: Fun and games! [SEP] content: Besides great Richard Scarry stories, there is even a game inside! It is a very fun Christmas time story book.	positive
title: You Know You Are Going to Need One [SEP] content: Good to keep on hand when the other one goes, or install if you don't have one. Add it to an order.	positive
title: Want Want Big Shelly Crispy Rice Crackers (Sugar) - One of my favorite snacks!! [SEP] content: I love these crackers...to me they are the perfect blend of salty and sweet and go great with peanut butter! I am happy to find them on Amazon and not to have to drive 1.5 miles to an Asian market.	positive
title: My First Garlock but Definitely Not Last...... [SEP] content: This was my first Dorothy Garlock book but I have now read about 15. This book is the beginning of four books that share characters. I love how Garlock doesn't abandon her characters and we see how their lives continue. Unlike other authors, she changes the setting and creates a whole new world for subsequent books. They can be read in order or they are wonderful stand alone stories. Here are the ones in this series:Edge of TownHigh on a HillA Place Called RainwaterRiver RisingI would recommend all of them!!Enjoy!	positive
title: Sounds really good [SEP] content: I read through Amazon's reviews and on other sites and most people liked these speakers and they are higher quality than the bottom line type. They have a long warranty which says something about the quality - IMO. I'm using as stereo speakers with a 2 channel Onkyo receiver and an Onkyo CD player and also for TV and DVDs. For small speakers the sound is very good. They have a very wide frequency range and I compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. I don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. I used on the floor and now they are perched on 30" stands. Either way sound good but I prefer the stands.Bottom line is if you are looking for an upgraded smaller speaker and don't want to spend a fortune these are the way to go.	positive
title: Sensationally wicked masterpiece! [SEP] content: A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.	positive
title: Sturdy, Compact but Spacious [SEP] content: i bought this to keep just random personal papers and stuff in, nothing really "valuable" to outsiders. So i can't speak to the lock and safety, but the product is designed well. plenty of room for lots and lots of files inside every-day commercial file folders. I like it a lot, and it's pretty compact and inobtrusive	positive
title: Its not what you think..... [SEP] content: Your supposed to think chain letter is about some evil curseor a demon out to kill.....but its not. I really suggest this book for more people who enjoy a more of a fictious plot, but not some monster risen from the dead plot. everything in this book could of happened.	positive
title: intriguing [SEP] content: This is the story of a former child prodigy who begins to lose his ability as he matures. We meet him as adult, who is teaching music at a college, and still longing to recover his previous ability. One day, he is summoned for jury duty and becomes involved in a murder case involving a young mentally ill man and his Zen teacher. He also becomes romantically involved with one of the jurors. At the same time, the narrator begins teaching a promising Korean boy who shows signs of being a prodigy. Salzman weaves all these threads into a deft, intriuging web about what it means to have talent and what it means to be human, although the book drags a little at the end, it is well worth the read.	positive
