title: *SWEET* [SEP] content: This book is a must have for BSB and Kevin fans!! It is so good! My friends mom even found it very interesting!!!!!	positive
title: Great Book about Civil Affairs [SEP] content: This is as good a Civil Affairs book as is available out there. It covers a Reserve CA unit in Iraq in 2004 and provides good insight to what Civil Affairs does, but has some grammatical errors and editing issues. Good book, overall, but I'd like to see an active unit chronicled both in and out of the Global War on Terror.	positive
title: Smart and gorgeous [SEP] content: This is really a gorgeous watch.The numbers are clear on the white base, and the stain less steel band is dual shaded, which adds to its beauty.Received in very good condition.I bought it for 34 bucks from Amazon.It could be worn on all kinds of occasions and officially as well, displays date too.I bought it as a gift for some one, the price is also good.	positive
title: Better than some reviews give it credit for [SEP] content: I have the seond edition of Learning Perl and find that this book is not only far more accessible, but covers things that are useful for beginners that Learning Perl does not. The DBI for instance.At the price this title is going for used it is a bargain.	positive
title: Umlaut Heaven [SEP] content: This DVD blew my head off. Could someone help me find it so I can listen to Blue Oyster Cult again?	positive
title: SEXY IS BACK!!! [SEP] content: LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR JUSTIN'S SOPHMORE ALBUM. MY FAVES ARE #7 AND #12.	positive
title: music for the millenium [SEP] content: As the millenium approaches, music must prepare itself for the inevitable change of the ages. And with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track "If I Could", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender "Heaven Only Knows" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful "Beyond Life" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], "Dreaming in Colors", and the African chant-anthem "Uneasy Street". Then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled "One Voice", and the seductive stirrings of "When She Comes". This is an absolute must!	positive
title: Amazingly good for the price [SEP] content: Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Christian Castro Vol. 2 - Karaoke CDG Songlist: [SEP] content: Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Cuando Me Miras Asi2. Con Ella3. Despues De Ti Que4. Lloran Las Rosas5. Lloviendo Estrellas6. Lo Mejor De Mi7. Manana Manana8. Si Tu Me Amaras	positive
title: A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story [SEP] content: Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the "commercial" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.	positive
title: a 40 watt light bulb works [SEP] content: I don't own a Zeno, but I read about the idea of heat treating cystic acne thanks to Zeno. It does work, but there's no need to spend $185. A 40 or 60 Watt light bulb in a lamp does the trick. Turn the lamp on, take the lampshade off, and hold the bulb against the zit for a couple minutes. Briefly switch the lamp off if it gets too hot.	positive
title: Great house for any insect [SEP] content: This is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.	positive
title: THE Best made american horror film [SEP] content: In the first 5 minutes of this film you see a man cut open this chicks stomach, fill it with acid, and slit his own throat. Great Beginning, Great Ending. Fans of Dario Argento, George A. Romero, And Lamberto Bava will not be dissapointed!	positive

title: Works Great [SEP] content: This is a much better alternative to the suction cup mount that came with my GPS. Just place it on your dash and it stays in place perfectly.	positive
title: So Funny [SEP] content: Chris Tucker at his best, no question. One of my favorite movies of all time. Recomend to anyone who has a sense of humor	positive
title: mind blowing! [SEP] content: I love the way Ellen Hopkins portrays the story through prose form. I caught myself reading "Crank" at lightning fast speeds because of how capturing her writing is. With writing in prose forms it offered me a new way of reading a book and having to learn how to read a book written this way. It was refreshing and daring. "Crank" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: Fantastic Textbook [SEP] content: I used this book to teach myself Scheme. It used to be offered at MIT as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 Python. Scheme is very much the "Latin" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. Highly encouraged.	positive
title: Love this DVD [SEP] content: This is an excellent DVD. I love it because it teaches while girls can be little princesses, they can still do things for themselves. My little girl loves it and I highly recommend it!	positive
title: foldable table [SEP] content: It's just the item I was looking for. I used the table for art shows to display my wares.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: Ramshackled Still Sounds GREAT [SEP] content: I bought this LP back in '77 and was blown away by the versatile drumming of Alan White. Every track has a different feel. I had to add this CD to my collection of growing YES CDs to replace old LPs. This is one of my favorits...	positive
title: This guy can sing! [SEP] content: Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!	positive
title: 3-6 is cool [SEP] content: Hey man, I read your review and I would have to agree with you on the wicked part. It seems that they don't know what to come up with now. For example, Choices 2, it was good but not as good as thier other stuff like Choices 1. It feels like they lost the feeling for music that they had before like "When the Smoke Clears," that was a cool CD. Hey, you know what happend to La Chat, Murder She Spoke was a kick @ss CD.	positive
title: Pre-Ordered [SEP] content: Not received yet, but have the first two seasons. Love the acting and the way the actors all fit together and seem like a real family. Tom Selleck is always great but really shines in this one. Really looking forward to receiving this and hope it will continue for many years.	positive
title: Lots of action [SEP] content: Great book if you like action stories. Complex, well-developed characters. Intriguing plot. Four sets of villains, sometimes hard to keep track of who's who, especially everybody is not what the seem. Long discourses on Bible history sometimes interrupts action at inappropriate times. Cotton Malone is a wonderfully developed character and I will read additional Steven Berry books with this character.	positive
title: Fabulous shoes [SEP] content: I wore these as a bridesmaid in a wedding and was prepared to change early in the reception, but they were much more comfortable than I expected. I bought a half size larger than I normally wear. I got tons of compliments.	positive
title: Alla Rakha was peerless and still is [SEP] content: What a slice of nirvana from 1968 [recorded in 1967, I believe]! For fans of Rich, I am not sure what the appeal would be, but for Alla Rakha devotees, this is one CD you cannot live without.The packaging is simple, but faithful to the original LP's artwork. All the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. You feel like the musicians are in the room-and I don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. Five Stars on this one.	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Excellent Book !!! [SEP] content: I just finished reading this book. I must say, that as a PC tech , this book is one of the best I've come across. Carey has made it easy for the casual user to understand how to take care of their own computer and fix simple problems. It's written in simple to understand language that anyone can follow. This book is also a valuable reference for even experienced technicians.I will be recommending this book as a must have for all of my customers. Thanks to Carey for bringing a book like this to the masses.	positive
title: good brother, Bad brother [SEP] content: this was a very interesting read . I learned many things reading this book. I have suggested others should read it.	positive
title: ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! [SEP] content: This is not only one of the best punk songs ever recorded, it's one of the best songs period. This song is as close to perfection as you can get, both lyrically and musically. You would think that an 18 minute song would be boring at times, but not this one. The changes in tempo and the scathing political commentary keep your interest the entire time. This is a masterpiece.	positive
title: Very useful book [SEP] content: Book was recommended for use by Interpreter Training program teacher as an additional tool. I have gotten considerable use out of it over the past year in my transliterating and asl classes. Only one drawback just recently noted. The DVD is not supported by the newer MAC OS Lion systems so I'm forced to use it on a Windows based computer. Other than that, very satisfied with this book.	positive
title: Trims well [SEP] content: This product works very well. The 3 cutting guides allow you to pick the correct length. There is an adjustable cutting guide that was of no use. The charger has to be plugged into the trimmer instead of just putting the trimmer into a charging cradle. This is inconvenient.	positive
title: Love and Trust [SEP] content: She suffered a terrible loss. But she found the love and trust she needed to go forward. You will cry.	positive
title: Phantom of the Opera original novel [SEP] content: Fantastic condition, NEW. Halfway through the book, enjoying it immensely.Perfect purchase, great seller.	positive
title: Fantastic Voyage [SEP] content: I first heard the Waybacks driving to the airport. Told my wife, "Hey this is really good stuff!" I'm pretty critical of what I listen to. I listen a lot, but not everything catches my ear. First heard them do I Wanna Be Like You and loved every minute. Then we saw the guys in person in Rutherfordton, NC. What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. I hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. If you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.	positive
title: It's OK, does the job [SEP] content: The Panavise Junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK. The ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and I would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. I'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. I've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts.	positive
title: What a GREAT STORIE! [SEP] content: From the first page you are sucked into this adventure! When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. From that point on you can't put the book down. It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone. I would have given this more than 5 stars. It is a keeper on my shelf. I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: An excellent book and analysis [SEP] content: This book is a very impressive piece of work. Shattan is very fair when he writes about each and every person, no matter what their political stripe. From Churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to Truman's acknowledgement of the danger that Communism posed to Adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the West to Solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the Cold War was really a moral struggle to Pope John Paul II's unwavering determination to free Poland to Ronald Reagan who ultimately caused the end of the Cold War; even though it came under Bush's administration; Shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis. This is well worth reading for anyone interested in the Cold War.	positive
title: Absolutely Addictive [SEP] content: I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions. They were so elegant. Very interesting saga. Well developed interesting characters.	positive
title: this is the BEST toy ! [SEP] content: I raise Lab puppies for Canine Companions...so I almost always have a lab puppy around.....this toy has NEVER been destroyed ( little feet chewed off though) The squeaker has always remained intact. It is a perfect dog toy for land or water play. My current pup LOVES making it squeak so much so that my parrot can now imitate the squeak!	positive
title: Texas Holdem Table Top [SEP] content: This product will do exactly the job it was designed for. I am pleased with with the quality, and feel that it is a good value I recommend it to all who enjoy poker.	positive
title: Beautiful game with lots of options! [SEP] content: Now, bear in mind -- I'm not an avid gamer - in fact I rarely play computer games altogether nowadays. My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. Perfect for kids and adults alike!	positive
title: Thanks! [SEP] content: Thanks for the speedy delivery. As a customer ordering from Germany I didn't expect to receive it so soon. Thanks!	positive
title: Loved it [SEP] content: Loved this cd. If you have heard CJ's first few albums and enjoyed them you will definately enjoy this. I recommend this for any CJ fan.	positive
title: a collect call from the sacremento county jail. [SEP] content: a dope album from another gardenblocc gangster. In his own words, "I wrote from the perspective of crack rock." Believe it. A shame we must lose another bomb MC to the prison system. Believe it.	positive
title: rage rocks [SEP] content: I have only had this cd for about a week. One of my friends told me about them so I bought it. At first I was unimpressed; but the more I listened the better it got. Rage is now my most likly favorite band and would recomend this CD to any one.	positive
title: Courtship of the Vicars Daughter [SEP] content: Loved this story,could hardly put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting story.	positive
title: Great stool for the price [SEP] content: This is a great looking stool for the price--Yes, assembly is a bit of a pain, but it took me about 25 minutes to put together (not too bad in my opinion)...just looks a little daunting at first seeing all the pieces it requires. The instructions and pictures are very easy to understand and follow.We haven't gotten too much use out of it yet, since both my kids are a little young yet, but I imagine a non-slip stick-on of some sort would be a good extra safety precaution to add to the stool.	positive
title: Great Support [SEP] content: Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.	positive
title: My favorite, wish was was in kindle [SEP] content: This was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that I purchased, but should not have to write so many words	positive
title: Works just like it's suppose to [SEP] content: The house we rent has a small washer/dryer and the vent runs up and out through the ceiling. The dryer motor isn't strong enough to push all the lint up and out so we ran the ProFlex down to the floor and now the dryer works much better.The only issue is that on a warm day, the heat from the dryer stays in the house and can make it even warmer inside. On the upside, on a cold day we don't have to run the heat so much.	positive
title: Fair fairy drawing [SEP] content: This book is easy to use and to read with some amusing and interesting fairy facts the sketched and line drawings are worth a good look at and the part about the different types of wings is acurate and interesting.I love the book and the ideas for changing the types of fairy's eg attitude and style.	positive
title: Family Favorite [SEP] content: If you love the Muppets you will love The Muppet Christmas Carol! This is one of the best versions of The Christmas Carol because it pretty much stays true to the original storyline, but it will not bore you out of you mind. This is a film for young and old. Great music, great humor, great characters, Great Muppetry!!! This is my families all-time favorite Christmas movies.	positive
title: Pleased [SEP] content: I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut. Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound... the old style.	positive
title: Pretty Good!! [SEP] content: This album is actually really good. Although short, it's definitely showsMonica has matured. Although the first track that was released was not that great, tracks like dozen roses and gotta move on makes us remember why fans will continue to support Monica. Hell No is definitely one of the best tracks on the album but what i didn't like is the fact that she tries the rapping too much. I prefer to hear her voice and think that she should stay true to the talented R&B; Singer that she is.	positive
title: VERY good reading! [SEP] content: Everything is well explained. I recommend it very strongly to anyone interested in Judaism. Starts simple but by Chapter 2 its heavily into Orthodox with hardly a mention of Conservatism!	positive
title: Genuine is almost always the best way to go! [SEP] content: Pretty straight forward, works like a champ. Genuine Canon, heavier cable (wish it was a tad bit longer).Love it.	positive
title: Pretty, well fitting belt. [SEP] content: Bought this as a gift for a friend who always had to borrow a brown belt from me. It is simple and cute. Great addition to any outfit, and it is well made.	positive
title: Fun to be "Sloppy" [SEP] content: A year in the life of a teenage girl named Jessica Darling. Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away. Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts.	positive
title: Very moisturizing, love it! [SEP] content: I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.	positive
title: One of the worst books I ever read [SEP] content: I didn't like the plot because it seemed very unrealistic. There was way too much graphic sex that didn't add to the character development. It wasn't engaging to me at all. Maybe I just didn't like any of the characters in the book.	negative
title: Theif Lord...I was rather Bored... by artemis11 [SEP] content: It was an OK book, if you like books where 5 years olds become aspiring thieves =(. Well anyway I better review it:The book starts when a wealthy lady come to Victor a Private Investigatior with a request to find her nephews. He accepts and eventally finds them, and begins to like them yada yada yada....You know what happens...They escape with the help of their friends...Everything turns out for the better...Typical Pre-Teen book...A review by artemis11	negative
title: Save your money [SEP] content: Transmitter is too weak. Transmission can be easily overcome by transmitters in vehicles passing by.Ugly long antenna line.Went out and bought a Griffin transmitter which has much more power.	negative
title: Not great [SEP] content: This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead.	negative
title: Wouldn't recommend it [SEP] content: Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product.	negative
title: Worked for 30 minutes [SEP] content: Worked for about the first 30 minutes, and then stopped working. At first I thought it was my laptop or my TV but after testing this cable with several TV's it's definately the cable.	negative
title: Carman: Beyond 1st Amendment Protection [SEP] content: Freedom of speech is an idea very dear to my heart. However, I find Carman's facist messages alarming, to say the least. I believe that Carman's message is so dangerous that it is not protected by the First Amendment. In fact, in postulating this message of a violent overthrow of the government by Christian Marxists, Carman is guilty of not only poor judgement, but treason. For this act of sedition he should be tried and subsequently hanged.	negative
title: It is ok but [SEP] content: I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with. It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that. I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model. This one is just not nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one. I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.	negative
title: No new information and poorly compiled [SEP] content: This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject.	negative
title: GT Interactive, too OLD for windows XP [SEP] content: doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs "Just Me & My Dad" and "Just Me & My Grandpa". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played.	negative
title: Great series but surprises ruined [SEP] content: The order in which everyone gets voted out is on each disc you pull out. How dumb is that?Otherwise it's a fun season which is why I bought it. I will probably never find the time to watch the commentaries.	negative
title: Great... until it died [SEP] content: I liked the toaster up until it gasped its last breath. It had great features like "keep warm". But it dies after only a year and a half of use. Too expensive (and big) to be disposable!	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Way Out Of Date [SEP] content: This little book needs to go away. The version of GIMP that it describes is long gone and not missed. The contents is nearly all useless, and there are so many better books on GIMP available.	negative
title: Terrible [SEP] content: This DVD just copied different pieces from many different sources on TV or Movies. They hired someone to talk about all those gossips. I wish I could get refund for this kind of DVD.If you have nothing to do and have too much money, buy it to kill some time and money.	negative
title: Save your Money [SEP] content: This pump could NOT pump warm cooking oil out of the pan. I gave up and went to the hardware store and purchased a large funnel with a filter. In my opinion, it is a piece of junk.	negative
title: Not true to size [SEP] content: I had to return the item because it was not true to size. There was no way, that this item was the size it was marked. I ordered an extra wide shoe, and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them, without them being loose on her. I wasnt happy at all.	negative
title: Christmas Nightmare with Vince Vaughn [SEP] content: My Title says it all. My Wife and I sat down to watch a Christmas movie together and decided to rent this.I wish I could get my 1hr and 29 mins back. This movie is bad, only reason I gave it 2 stars was Reese Witherspoon.Vaughn still can't act his way out of a paper bag and the rest of the cast was painful to watch. If you want a funnyChristmas movie to rent on Amazon check out Surviving Christmas with Ben Affleck.	negative
title: Avoid this brand! [SEP] content: I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand.	negative
title: Proves the theory... [SEP] content: Great sidemen don't always make great composers. Jan Garbarek is a brilliant contemporary saxophonist. His body of work playing with the likes of Keith Jarrett, Charlie Haden, Ralph Towner, Art Lande and other ECM artists is simply stunning.But "Visible World" can only be described as a collection of banal Kenny G. new-age cliches. What happened? Perhaps Jan wanted to go after some of that big Kenny G. cash? Or maybe, absent the collaboration of other great musicians, Garbarek's creativity left him? Either way, this CD is beneath him, certainly not a reflection of his prodigious talent. Skip this, and instead savor some of his most amazing work on Keith Jarrett's "Personal Mountains".	negative
title: Good looks ain`t everything [SEP] content: It's a very nice looking coffee machine, but it always leaves a mess. The filter pops open while the coffee is still brewing, it over floats quite often and you end up with a lot of coffee grinds in your coffee	negative
title: Ja-Blah! [SEP] content: When i first bought into bluetooth fone technology i was sold but beware there are drawbacks! First the Ja-Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth. Connectivity! it is there. it seems to do the basic stuff ok....but when you demand more from it like crystal clear calls or reception away from phone...look for another earpeice! this device gets static @ 5 or more ft...the echoes you get are nothing short of what past reviewers say about it..when u buy a product you want it to work @ least 90% of time not 70%..Always remember to do you homework when buying these devices b/c they are expensive(cost as much as many cell phones!)...buy earpices from companies who actually make cell phones(motorola for example)..they tend to understand the "reception game" a little better....happy hunting!	negative
title: DISLIKE THIS UNIT [SEP] content: TIE THIS THING DOWN. IT VIBRATES THE WHOLE COUNTER,MAKES NOISE WHILE MIXING, NEEDS LIGHT IN DISPLAY WINDOW.IN MY OPINION NOT A GOOD BUY AT ALL	negative
title: Stopped working in a year [SEP] content: This router was good for a year but stopped working after that. Not worth it for the money I spent.	negative
title: HORRIBLE! [SEP] content: Don't waste your time. It is a waste of paper. The only thing the book has going for it is that the "action" never stops. The "action" is also unbelievable. A fair plot ruined and gone terribly bad.	negative
title: Enough already [SEP] content: Haven't we overdosed on semiotics taken to its idiotic extreme? Do throw rugs and hardwood floors really "say" that much about us? Can you tell how daring we are simply by the number of knick-knacks we own? This book is forensic jive from self-appointed experts whose only real concern is whether or not their tastes conform to the latest Interview fad.	negative
title: THIS IS SO[ Awful]!!! [SEP] content: This is an awful movie. There is only one good jolt in the whole thing, but other than that this isn't scary at all. Just a long boring piece of cinema. The re-make was better, and the re-make was awful as well. Don't see it alone in the dark, because you'll need someone to wake you up!	negative
title: was not pleased [SEP] content: Had to redrill holes wood cracked just was not pleased with it but already put it together i will go ahead and keep it is not worth the price i payed for it.	negative
title: Please enter a title for your review [SEP] content: although i like bill maher's talk show i've always found his opening monologues painfully amateurish and unfunny so i don't know what possessed me to check out this one hour stand-up set but it's firmly set him in my mind as the worst stand-up comedian i've ever endured. his Bush bashing and otherwise cliched sentiments have never been less cleverly expressed.	negative
title: Lots of unrealized potential [SEP] content: I bought this thinking I'd like it a lot. Every review I read made it sound like the type of music I'd like to own, esp. the idea that this was groundbreaking genre bending man-machine melding music. The clips sounded good too. Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed. Moby takes some good ideas and goes nowhere with them.	negative
title: So so aweful [SEP] content: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.	negative
title: An okay gift... [SEP] content: I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose...	negative
title: I'm being generous with the two stars [SEP] content: This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing andelementary at best. I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC.	negative
title: Very Cheap - Low Quality [SEP] content: I was excited to see the great price, and was hoping to see a halfway descent product. Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up. I regret this purchase and will be returning for a refund.	negative
title: Do not purchase for eReaders [SEP] content: This book is so poor in format for an eReader that I am recommending you not purchase it in this format at all. The pages don't line up properly. Some pages have black backgrounds, some white, and several don't even wrap properly. The content is ok, but hard to follow because of previous issues noted.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: defective [SEP] content: I'v just received the sheet set today. The sheet itself is soft and the color is beautiful as advertised. However,I 've found the defective. It was cut (about 3 inches)and the fabric is torn aprt. I have to return the stuff...very disappointed.	negative
title: Double boiler is only half [SEP] content: What??? A double boiler without the bottom part that holds the water isn't functional. It should be made CLEAR that it comes as only the top part with a curved bottom that won't stand on it's own. Thusly, unless the other part, which is another saucepan w/ lid is purchased, you're out of luck. Btw, the other half costs as much as the double boiler.	negative
title: CONFUSING [SEP] content: I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one.	negative
title: A Work of an ignorant conductor - Bad continuo choice [SEP] content: Harpsichord should be replaced with a organ and one or more theorbo. It is highly in doubt that Henry Purcell ever used 8'/4' choired type harpsichord to support continuo part for his trumpet composition. There are indeed Virginal (small & relatively inexpensive version of harpsichord) but these loud type harpsichords here were non existent throughout the époque of Sir William Byrd, Sir John Dowland, Sir John Blow, Sir Edward Stafford, Henry Purcell and his two brothers Sir.Thomas and Sir.Daniel Purcell, all held a royal positions in France, Denmark and England one or more times in their lives. I Suggest that the conductor resign from his post and should give up all harpsichord parts and get advises from Sir John Elliott Gardiner, William Christie, David Taylor, Konrad Junghanell and like to redo the work of Purcell. Those true gentlemen have great deal of knowledgeabout Purcell's work.	negative
title: impossible to clean [SEP] content: I bought this pan as a trial -- thinking that if I liked it I would buy a set of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. I won't be buying more. I've only used it three times, and as far its preformance is concerned it seems fine -- the heat distribution is good, and the food came out well. However, after only three uses, it has developed an ugly hazy stain that is impossible to remove. I've followed all the cleaning instructions that came with the pan, but to no avail. The "hard-anodized" aluminum doesn't seem so hard after all.	negative
title: Only has a couple of good cartoons [SEP] content: I didn't like this DVD ... I enjoy the black and white Popeye and there wasn't too many of them on this disc. I never did care for the color Popeye, and this is mostly what is on this DVD. I gave my copy away to the Library and bought the black and white Popeye that is from 1933-40. Must better DVD.	negative
title: WARNING:THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: My friends first and foremost I would want everyone to ignore the previous reviewer(An alias of Whirligig) and avoid this lousy Green Day cd.Green day are legends only in the previous reviewer"s mind.Their only listenable cd is Dookie which only deserves a two star rating.Forget Green day,listen to Led Zeppelin's debut album instead.that rocks!,not this.	negative
title: Roller Hardness Problem [SEP] content: I was originally delighted with this opener. I like safety openers and my last one, a Swiss-made one, lasted a dozen years. This opener worked very well for the first several weeks, but the cutting edge wore down to the point of uselessness after only 3 months. The cutting wheel is made of a softer steel than is needed for long-term use. Older versions may not have had this problem. This opener is now made in China.	negative
title: Good phone UNTIL the screen dies on you! [SEP] content: Overall I liked this phone - until a weeks after the warranty expired the screen DIED! Yes, folks - the internal screen on these phones have a 1 yr lifespan...Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use it for less then 1 yr!I am not kidding.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: My days ruined! [SEP] content: I was all excited about recieving this blender for a birthday present & when after buying all these ingredients to make hummus, I started mixing it in the blender & in 10 minutes I smelled the smell of a burnt out motor & sure enough it died then & there.I don't know if I'll even bother getting another blender cause I had another slightly cheaper one recently made by Proctor Silex that I got 2 full uses out of it before that one died so that assures me that today's quality is crap compared to old school.The Kitchen my partents had lasted for decades!Don't throw away reciept & packing box if you buy this blender!!!	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: frustrated to the MAX [SEP] content: I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash.	negative
title: o god give it up [SEP] content: ok people. lets get this straight. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE FAKE, WANNABE, RADIO-FRIENDLY, POP. they are not punk. if u want real punk buy M.I.A. The Complete Anthology by the germs. i am sick of all these people who do nothing but shop at hot topic and pretend they are punk. REAL PUNK IS ANGER. THIS PUNK IS FASHION.DESTROY EVERYTHING!	negative
title: YHE WORST OF ALL [SEP] content: IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL	negative
title: What's So Funny? [SEP] content: I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of "Lord of the Flies." It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.	negative
title: Dovetail rings [SEP] content: These will NOT fit a standard weaver or picatinny rail.....they are for 3/8" dovetail mounts and I just wasted my money. Be foreworned-apparently I missed the 22 part but the description talks about weaver mounts so idk.	negative
title: A Weak Attempt at Espresso [SEP] content: I had an ancient Krups espresso machine and decided I wanted an upgrade. Researched and chose the Cuisinart EM-100 as a reasonably priced entry level machine. My first unit had to be returned as the power button would not stay on. My second unit operates properly but there are multiple quality issues. The espresso is weak despite multiple attempts and variations of grind and tamping pressure. The unit advertises that it heats water for making tea - but it only heats to 165-180 degrees - not hot enough for tea. I have contacted Cuisinart by phone and email to see if they have any suggestions and have received no responses. All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I have had good experiences with Cuisinart products in the past but will probably never buy another.	negative
title: Very disappointing [SEP] content: My son was very disappointed when he received this item. It looks nothing like the picture. The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture. I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this. I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available.	negative
title: Not adequate for most home cleaning [SEP] content: I bought this steamer at a local store, and returned it after trying once. It is small, well-built and convenient to carry around. However, I found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs. The heat was not enough and the pressure was not enough for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us. I'm waiting for a powerful hand held steamer.	negative
title: It you buy this item, cross your fingers [SEP] content: I ordered this spice rack and one of the arms was broken when I recieved it. I returned it to Amazon and they shipped me another one right away. It was broken in the exact same way. The other reviews say the same thing. If you order this, cross your fingers that it doesn't come broken.	negative
title: Not good [SEP] content: This product does not work as advertised. With sensitive skin in leaves red markswhere hair is removed. On legs it does not remove hair. Only makes it shorter.Save your money. I would send it back if it wasn't too late. My face is a mess.	negative
title: To ride a carousel is fun for a while !! [SEP] content: Listening to this music is like riding a carousel; its great fun, but in the end you're back where you started and then it all starts over again.I mean I loved Genesis and the art rock scene when I first heard their tunes in the middle of the 70:s. But this , whats the point? It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke	negative
title: waste of money [SEP] content: only worked twice, then stopped. not worth it. i would not recommend this product there are other more expensive which will work better	negative
title: still waiting for a response [SEP] content: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar...	negative
title: Just don't buy it....trust me [SEP] content: It just doesn't work up to even a quarter of what you think it will do.When it does work, it takes to to the "pinnacle" of a project, then either crashes, won't burn, or will burn with very messy results and will make you very sorry you spent money and time on this piece of garbage.	negative
title: WHAT??? [SEP] content: When I recieved this game, it had two HUGE scratches on it, and I tried using a disk saver, but that didn't work. So now I have a game that doesn't work. :(	negative
title: Will have adverse effects on your Xbox! [SEP] content: Seemed to work fine at first, just made the whole thing louder. A couple months later though, I started receiving an error relatively frequently on startup. It wasn't the Red Ring of Death, but an error nonetheless, along with a wierd moaning whirring coming from the Xbox. I thought the Xbox was going bad. I started looking for another one of these for my new Elite, and came across all the other reviews about this bad product. I took it off my old Xbox, and it worked great again. Luckily as far as I can tell it didn't do any noticeable long lasting damage. Hopefully it will still last awhile when I give it to my brother. It's definitely not worth the risk!	negative
