title: If Your Looking For A Good Crue Album... [SEP] content: Greatest Hits is the most suitable title for this album. Released in 1998, Motley Crue's greatest hits is a great compilation album for any die-hard Crue fan. On the album you'll find hits such as: Kickstart My Heart, Dr. Feelgood, and Smokin' In The Boys Room. If your into the heavier Crue stuff, you'll find hits such as Too Fast For Love, Looks That Kill, and Shout At The Devil! If your looking for a good variety of Motley Crue songs on a single album, then Motley Crue: Greatest Hits is the album for you.	positive
title: LOVE IT! [SEP] content: Are you pondering what I'm pondering? Sure, but horizontal stripes make me look hippy.A must for any fan. The best part (really!) is the extra material with Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen -- they are as intelligent, witty and friendly with each other as you'd ever hope. Restores your faith in humanity.	positive
title: TAILOR MADE ROLE FOR BLACK! TOUGH TO DISLIKE! [SEP] content: Black is his usual over the top self in this very funny crowd pleaser. The supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. Throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. The original release on DVD has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.	positive
title: An extraordinary piece of work! [SEP] content: Lois Gladys Leppard is a very talented author. She knows exactly how to draw the attenion of any 8-12 year old to her fantastic books. In the first chapter, Mandie's father dies and her stepmother is cruel to her. So, her dear indian friend, Uncle Ned leads her to her uncle John's mansion where she discovers a tunnel built by her great-grandfather in order to hide the Cherokees when they were being driven out of their land by the whites. Also she is reunited with her real mother, who marries Mandie's uncle John.This great story will keep you on the edge of your seat and not want to put it down. Keep writing those Mandie books, Mrs. Leppard!	positive
title: Good Customer Service - OK Quality Control [SEP] content: We bought this game for Christmas. I wanted the wooden balls and a sturdy cage. The first unit that was shipped to us had a defective cage. I called the maker of the game instead of returning to amazon, because I wanted them to know about the quality error for such a high priced set. They shipped out a new cage very quickly at no charge. Our balls were well marked (two of the markings my 8 yr old had to look at twice, but were still readable). We would have liked a few mor cards in the set. I would say they are the weakest part of the set. The sliders do not easily move and there is no way to order additional cards and be sure there will not be a duplicate.Overall, we are happy with the set.	positive
title: Not a better bluegrass album exists [SEP] content: I was truly amazed at the reality of this DVD audio disk. And my DVD player isn't a DVD Audio player. I have never heard better bluegrass on any album and I used to play bluegrass on stage.	positive
title: Good for what we needed! [SEP] content: We placed game show board games out as center pieces at our company meeting and this was a fun one to display. The game came on time and in great condition!	positive
title: Great product! [SEP] content: At first glance, the sound machine looks very outdated and old, but it really does a great job of masking noise. Our son had gotten used to sleeping with a humidifier, but I was tired of filling it, so thought I'd try this instead and it is awesome! They could work on updating the look, though!	positive
title: Dax, Bashir, O'Brian On A Fantastic Voyage [SEP] content: It's the Adventures through Innerspace, Star Trek style. The makers of the series give us a new twist on a classic science fiction story. I dug it, and thought it was well done. If you remotely like Star Trek, you'll appreciate this. 4.5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'	positive
title: AMAZING............. [SEP] content: Ok for all of you R&B love song people ( i am one if them)I know u all of u look for the words. All the slow "love songs" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. One thing youll hear on this CD is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, EVRYTHING. It will capture your mind, when u hear Brians Vocals on "6,8,12" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on "Shall We Begin" smooth....as silk. But dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than "You should be Mine". Overall this album is much better than his "Anytime" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. The only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what Mr. McKnight will deliver next...can it get better? Im just not sure - Ray Roa	positive
title: Smitten, still... [SEP] content: Like many, I remain smitten by the story, the movie and the original soundtrack. This "differnt" rendition fills that gap wanting an extension to the instrumental portions of the original.	positive
title: Regina is the best!!! [SEP] content: Think..a happy Tori Amos. Think..Fiona Apple at her proper weight level.This is great music. And Regina Spektor should be a star. I can't wait to see what's next.	positive
title: granddaughter pleaser [SEP] content: this Christmas was extra special when the pogo stick was the first to arrive. My granddaughter, who knows a whole lot more about computers than I, just thought I was the greatest because I shopped on line. Thanks, amazon for making this a terrific help when time is of the essence.	positive
title: The Table [SEP] content: We have this table and its been great! We have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.She loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.The chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - I would recommend trying it out -	positive
title: interesting & usefull [SEP] content: small & quite handy book. Usefull when one's in doubt about the color range. I can recommand it to anyone.	positive
title: Works fine [SEP] content: I used it couple of times for flour, sugar, even for coffee creamer... no problems at all. I hand washed it and dried it and it looks good. The metal could be a bit thicker, but it's not too bad. It might be a bit too small for people who bake in large amounts, but it works just fine if you need something for every day use that won't take too much space.	positive
title: Marty Done Well [SEP] content: Got everything you'd want here, no complaints. Early at his prime and pleanty of him. Only critique is this version of "El Paso" is the shorter one, missing the stanza between shooting the wild young cowboy and heading for Rosa'a back door. I dunno why, maybe timing for radio which was a serious consideration back in the day. Might have liked the "El Paso" spinoffs that he wrote later, but this is a nice compilation for Marty fans, especially on a long trip.	positive
title: Why didn't I order this sooner? [SEP] content: This was much better than I expected. Went together in minutes without any tools. Mine is in the garage, and so far I don't feel I need to attach it to the wall. I dropped one of the arms during installation and the flat piece that goes against the main bar got a little bent, but it's still functional. I'm really impressed with this stand, it's sturdy and yet light and needs no tools, and I was able to put two types of women's bikes on there adjusting the arms as needed. No need to add a straight bar to ladies bikes!Very, very happy with this.	positive
title: This book got me through basic military training. :] [SEP] content: I bought this book on a Sunday while I was in basic training for the USAF. I really got me through some of the tougher days, and I treasure this book to this day- I have pages marked and certain sections highlighted. I love this book!	positive
title: HP Photosmart 8MP Camera [SEP] content: This camera is neat and easy to use. I love the large 2.5" display screen. To change settings is quick and easy.Can't beat the Price. The Picture Quality is good. It takes excellent daytime shots......really clean.The Video Quality is alright. A good buy for my part.	positive
title: Good value pack for 3 films [SEP] content: The video looks slightly better than an upscaled DVD. If you already have the original DVDs, it may not be worth upgrading unless you find it on sale. But if the films are new to you, then the gift set is a good value.	positive
title: Good for pesky rashes [SEP] content: This is one of the most useful products for a light rash or that uncomfortable itch. Price was superior to stores.	positive
title: Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler. [SEP] content: Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler. We have the bell receiver located in an addition about 50 feet from the transmitter. The signal has to go through two outside walls covered with aluminum siding (or it's bouncing through the house?). Works fine and solve our problem of not hearing the doorbell when working in that part of the house.Later: It's now been installed more than 3 years. Still works fine.	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: this was a gift for my brother and he was so soprised when he opened it, now he uses it all the time and it works so fine nice audio quality and it was a very good price and shipping time.	positive
title: Closer by Josh Groban [SEP] content: I received this item very quickly and it was in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again.	positive
title: One of the Best Soccer Coaching books, unique in presentation [SEP] content: This book is just great. I knew as soon as I picked it up, it was easy and fun to read and had the kind of info I needed. I coach two kids soccer teams and I got many great ideas to help my practices. Lots of books are just pages and pages of drills, and others are just theory. The nit-pickers who picked on one page out of this book they did not agree with are missing all the other great stuff here. No book is perfect, but I got more usuable ideas from this book than I have from any other, and I've read scores of them.	positive

title: AMAZING [SEP] content: I love this game! It is very good becuase of the great gameplay and graphics. I think this is going to be ten times better than blitz. It will have more players, plays, and tricks along with the same great gameplay. I can't wait till this game comes out and your crazy if don't think this is going to be a good game. I have always been a madden fan but NFL street will blow it away. I also heard that a secret players like LT and Barry Sanders. GO out and get this game NOW!	positive
title: Good lens for what I want (not change the lens) [SEP] content: as you can read in other reviews, it does suffer from pincushion and vignetting so did my old 18-55mm so nothing changed there. I like this lens because of the nice range 18 to 135mm, I was considering the 55-200mm but I don't see myself changing lenses most of the time. I recommend it.	positive
title: It's a very good reference. [SEP] content: I'm a dental student studying gross anatomy. Usually, students don't have enough skill in disecting the cavador to all stuctures (arteries, muscles, vein, nerves) they've studied. This reference help me improving and completing my lab skill. Its pictures are all color. They're all real picture. All structure are all clear. (clean fascia very clearly) Some sturctures are dyed so they help you identify and understand it easier.It's the best lab reference book I've ever had.	positive
title: I am a changed man [SEP] content: OK, OK, OK. I originally gave this a 1-star review, because I originally hated it. Let me tell you...I gave this CD a couple hundred 2nd chances, and I have loved it more and more every time I listen to it. WOW. Absolutely amazing. Every song on here is astounding with its ability to instantly put the listener in a trance. Almost as amazing as Kid A(their best by far). Personal favorite song; "Like Spinning Plates".	positive
title: What a voice! [SEP] content: This is probably my favorite album by Randy Travis, and definately a must-have for anyone who enjoys Randy's music. He gets you with EVERY song -- with warmth, humor and that gorgeous deep voice! It's like he's right there, singing to you, telling you his story. The fun "If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another" probably describes your life perfectly! The beautiful "Long On Lonely, Short On Pride", "I Wish It Would Rain" ("so she won't see what she's doin' to me") and "Future Mister Me" and "Price to Pay" are rich with emotion, humility, and honesty, -- they are all soooooo good! Need upbeat and twangy Randy? -- check out "Would I" (he had to be dancing when he recorded this one!) You will not be disappointed!	positive
title: Fun! [SEP] content: My 5 year old has these in white and loves them. We like that they are a little bit big - it makes it easier for him to put them on. Its fun for roll playing.	positive
title: Excelente Reloj [SEP] content: Excelente reloj, tiene numeros claros y faciles de ver. Es muy facil de configurar. Es un muy buen reloj por este precio.	positive
title: Masters of the Accordion [SEP] content: My husband was extremely pleased. He is seeking more accordion music of this type.	positive
title: Not quite as good.... [SEP] content: This is a great CD by a great band, don't get me wrong. It's just after listening to the excellent "Introduction to Mayhem" I expected a little more out of Primer 55. Still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at Best Buy! Any Primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. It kicks ....	positive
title: Great little grill!! [SEP] content: This is the best little grill. I had to replace my old George Foreman and this was a perfect replacement. I especially love the removable plates, it makes cleaning such a breeze. I definitely recommend this product	positive
title: Lovely Book! [SEP] content: I am a big Tudor fan & love the artwork in this lovely book! I've also tried two of the recipes, so far, & thought they were terrific!	positive
title: Yummy! [SEP] content: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!	positive
title: Wild Seed [SEP] content: I have read three of Butler's books, the Parable of the Sower, Clay's Ark and Wild Seed. This is my third favorite. Butler is an imaginative and masterful writer. I continue to be impressed by her.	positive
title: Adorable, well made train [SEP] content: For those with the wooden railway set, this sweet train is a great addition. These are high quality toys and the magnets are solid.	positive
title: Good plot [SEP] content: I had to come back and edit this review. Previously (years ago) I had given the movie a bad review because Amazon had ripped me off and I couldn't download the movie. Since then, Amazon has fixed their glitches, and I have finally been able to see the movie. It was well acted, and I like how they went back to the art over film style (as was done with a movie back in the 80's....I think it was Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit, or something like that). The cast worked well for the movie, and the plot, while slow, kept me watching. I apologize for the bad review that I left before because of Amazon's flaw.	positive
title: It's a Keeper [SEP] content: I would recommend this game to anyone... but I have to say that there's a couple of disappointments i've run into in comparison to previous FIFA Soccer Versions.. in FIFA 2003 I learned that there isn't a Create-A-Player mode in the game which I find disappointing another is gameplay might be too hard for beginners although I'm trying not to be negative this is an awesome game certaintly one of EA Sports best. just those two things disappoint me for some reason but I won't be returning it I'll defenitly enjoy this awesome title !	positive
title: Organic bar with good taste and texture [SEP] content: This is one of the better tasting bars I've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of "nutty" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other "energy" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. I think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. I'll be purchasing more of these.	positive
title: Fun game true to the anime [SEP] content: I played this game years ago on the Sega Saturn with my cousin's two kids. They were both as in love with the characters and game play as I was. It wasn't the most challenging of games but the humor and cut scenes made it well worth it.We ended up getting into both the anime and manga because of how much we enjoyed the story. Its a shame you can't get this game for less money but if you can find it for less definitely get it. It was a great ending for a beloved console. Wish I still had this game and my Sega Saturn.	positive
title: Finally found Sugar Daddys [SEP] content: My sister has Celiac Disease and can only eat certain gluten-free foods...luckily, Sugar Daddys are perfect & Hershey's Milk Chocolae bars are just a couple of the only candy bars she can have. She was so thrilled to get a box of Sugar Daddys for Christmas she said that's all she wants for her birthday. Sooo, that's what she's getting!!! She likes the smaller ones..Daddy pops!	positive
title: great lens and great photos [SEP] content: Update on 06/05: If the exposure is correct, the image is sharp at ANY focal length. Greatest lens for landscape and portrait. There is no dark corner and no distortion.Having the lens for 5 days, I am very happy with this lens. This is my first L lens and it is much better than any of other lenses. The lens was put on my XTI camera. I ignored all the comments that this lens does not match this camera. What I wanted to do is to get nice pictures on the camera on hand. Widness is not the only issue to measure the quality of the lens. I uploaded one picture and definitely that is not the best picture because I am still improving my photographic skills.Bought $1350 at Buydig with a $150 Heleopan UV filter.	positive
title: Garmin Case does its job [SEP] content: Purchased a leather case to go with my new Garmin 760. Works well to protect the unit. Highly recommend getting one of these so the screen doesn't get damaged every time you tske it off or install it in the car.	positive
title: Mother Goose: A Fragmented Tale [SEP] content: Hardly is one character or situation introduced until the author skips to another. Even given the brief attention span of a reader of modern fiction, the lack of continuity, excessive use of jump-cuts, and economy of presentation leave the reader searching in vain for the central theme. Still, the basic rawness of its poetic passages has a visceral attraction and a primitive strength. I anxiously await its rendering in the media of film, to see how the director will tie together the diverse range of metaphorical, even alegorical, passages into a cohesive whole.	positive
title: Liar's Poker [SEP] content: If you've been following the events on Wall Street for the past 3 years or so, you'd think you'd heard it all. Well, if you'd purchased Liar's Poker when it was published, you'd have heard it all then. Michael Lewis was there in the waning hours of Salomon Brothers and he captured the psyche of traders and investment firms in this revealing and hilarious expose'. Liar's Poker should be required reading for anyone involved in financial services.	positive
title: Worked and it retested to exceed spec [SEP] content: Solid well made patch cable using commercial grade stranded CAT5e with Green outer jacket. It was Made in China. Non-plenum	positive
title: Excellent knife that feels "right" in your hands! [SEP] content: I picked-up a 10" Wushtof Chef (the one on this page) and a 6" Chef when I was in Germany and I love them. The 10" is large enough that you can cut large items and also has a wider blade that helps with "proper" chopping technique for those of us who are not "professionals". Of course, the wider blade also allows you to scoop-up a good amount of ingredients for transfer to where-ever you need them.Even for being such a large blade, the knife is light, balanced and easy to handle. I anticipate that these knives will last me a lifetime if properly cared for (for example, I always use the honing rod before use which will help prevent the need for sharpening). I recommend these knives to everyone I know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and I feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those "sets" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway).	positive
title: Great comedian [SEP] content: The package arrived on time and great condition. The dvd itself was amazing. I was laughing the entire hour the show was going for. Dimitri Martin is probably my favorite comedian.	positive
title: Great style and craftsmanship. [SEP] content: This watch looks very classy yet rugged, and it feels very solid. The face changes color depending on how the light hits it. It goes from a shiny bright blue (bright sunlight) to a deep rich blue (little light) to almost black (little light). Setup is a little confusing but not too bad. I found a simplified version of the setup manual on Citizen's web site. I suggest you do the same. I'm very happy with the purchase and the price on Amazon was very good.	positive
title: Good but way too much hype [SEP] content: When I heard everyone raving about the MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR I had to check it out for myself. I've seen her BLONDE AMBITION and GIRLIE SHOW tours (on video) before so I was ready for this one. I have to say that much of it is hype. It was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. The costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. Madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. The bull ride that she did in "don't tell me/human nature" was way too short. It wasn't even worth mentioning. Some people described the geisha themed segment as "awesome" and "magical" but I found it to be OK at best. She flew across the stage.. BIG DEAL. She did an air spin like a scene out of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... cool. I thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. And what the heck was up with that anime video thing? It was weird. So, I was a bit disappointed at times. MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR ends with her hit "music."	positive
title: A Girls Survival Through Disaster [SEP] content: As you are lead through the book, you may see what you don't want to see. It is as if you were there, engaged in this struggle to live through the dustbowl. As this little girl has to deal with disaster at such a young age, so did many, and most of them got through it the same, by hope. You might think the real struggle would be her with her environment, but what she finds out is that the struggle is really between her and her heart and mind. After the "accident," all she has left is her father, not even her piano, which deserted her along with everything else. Does she escape? Will she survive? Find out by reading "Out of the Dust," by Karen Hesse.	positive

title: REAL rock n roll mayhem!!! [SEP] content: This is a pretty boss platter from one of the truly great rock n roll (garage if you will) bands that the world has seen. The first side of this album is specataular, the second is solid too, although not quite as overwhelming as side 1. Contains a number of true classics, incl. "Don't Give it up now, which was good enough that the mighty ? and the Mysterians actually covered it on a recent album!!!!	positive
title: This was one book I couldn't put down [SEP] content: I loved the book it was really good. I couldn't put it down. Ms. Braun has really done a wonderful job and I have read all her books and I think this one wasn't as well written as the others but it was still very good reading and I would recommend it to anyone.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: Great product. I've never been cut/otherwise harmed by it, it's fast and efficient, does its job. I don't really see a point for the light, but whatever.	positive
title: Words cannot describe it [SEP] content: I type this review for those surfing Amazon looking for new music.I sit here at my computer with headphones on, Olsen Olsen playing for the 9th time tonight, feeling rather fortunate that I stumbled on to Sigur Ros while surfing Amazon.com for new music.Words cannot describe the music on this album. Sounds so beautiful it will make you weep. Get the CD. Put the kids to bed. Plug in the headphones. Close your eyes. Play the CD. See the angels coming down to earth, singing the most heavenly music you have ever heard.For those who just don't get it, I truly feel sorry for you. You are really missing out on one of the most unbelievable musical experiences of our time.	positive
title: Satisfied buyer [SEP] content: I purchased this textbook new at a good price. I received free shipping and the book arrived sooner than I expected. This is a great book for anyone who is currently in, or entering the education field. It has lots of helpful information. I am very pleased with the way the information is presented.	positive
title: For the right audience, a good book [SEP] content: There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.	positive
title: Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner ! [SEP] content: Absolutely As good or better than the first.It Hit's all the marks in writing,direction,acting ect..Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner! and may have revived the franchise of American Pie. The ends credit scene with Stiffler's Mother in the Movie Theatre was funny as hell!.	positive
title: Best bottles I have found [SEP] content: I have three children. For the first one, I bought all those curved Healthflow bottles to keep the air out of my daughter's system. Big Pain!!. They were hard to clean. I used the Playtex bottles for my two younger children. They are much easier to clean. I could even put the rings and caps in my dishwasher. I would recommend these bottles to any mother. There are a variety of nipple shapes available to experiment with. My daughter liked the natural brown ones and my son liked the rounded top in the brown and silicone varieties.	negative
title: If i could rate this -5 stars i would [SEP] content: This thing is crap not powerful and hard to set up. I have a background in electric and it was still a pain for me. YOu will have to solder some connections in order to set up the ground properly. The instructions arent very good either. Also the lights die when you come to a stop unless you wire a battery into the circuit.	negative
title: Winning Eleven 7 wannabe [SEP] content: This game tries to come close to the gameplay of Winning Eleven 7, but it doesn't even come close.Get Winning Eleven 7 if you want to play a true 'FOOTBALL' (and not, its not soccer) game.	negative
title: Shallow - why buy this book at all? [SEP] content: There are quite a few other books on sniping that you need to buy before this one. I do not know about the background of the other reviewers but to call this a good book on sniping is BS. A very, very light introduction, maybe, but the book does not cover ANYTHING in detail. It is at best useful for a wanna-be sniper and maybe not even so: If you include so little details, but still manage to explain where to shoot a man in the head it is at best missguiding.I am sure that mr. Lonesdale knows his stuff, but this book is lightweight.	negative
title: Didn't catch the rat [SEP] content: We meticulously followed the directions and gave the trap 3 weeks to work. We then bought a live cage trap for considerably less. The disposal is not fun, but no more rat within a couple of days. I'll be trying out the rat zapper on mice and see if it does any better.The idea behind the rat zapper is great, but I'd like to see it work.	negative
title: Anticlimactic [SEP] content: This novel started off just fine. I was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.The characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. In his usual style, Dean Koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.However, the ending was so disappointing. I felt robbed of my time and energy. Maybe I have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.Definitely not one of Koontz's better novels. He does have many more satisfying works.	negative
title: Shape-shifters are a dog of a disappointment. [SEP] content: Should have been called "Dark Menagerie." I loved Holly's "Beyond Seduction" and "Beyond Innocence," so why did I find this eagerly anticipated book so...boring? Simply, it's missing the humanity that made the previous novels both plausible and sexy. If you can't get enough of shape-shifting, blood-drinking, angst-filled immortals in search of life mates to convert, this is for you. Personally, I hope Holly just dipped into the fantasy genre for a lark, and will give us a few more of the sizzling erotic historical romances that I enjoyed so much before.	negative
title: Get a Lexmark Toner for a Lexmark Printer [SEP] content: I bought the Radian toner cartridge to replace my aging Lexmark toner cartridge. The Radian cartridge has lasted a measly three months - keep in mind that a laser printer toner should be good for six thousand copies - and did a tour of duty of about five hundred prints. Now, the cartridge has littered my printer with dust residue and has caused only entirly black pages to print. This cartridge is a horrible piece of crap! Avoid it at all costs, especially since it costs almost $100.	negative
title: Dated, unclear material [SEP] content: The material in this book is dated (2000). The writing style is highly superficial with little depth not already available for free via java.sun.com. The content is too wordy, not enough pictures/diagrams. The code examples are superficial.There are much better books out there, if you need a book. Check out Core J2EE Patterns, online J2EE tutorial, Java Enterprise in a nutshell.	negative
title: Predictable [SEP] content: I really like these kinds of romance novels. Particularly novels set in Scottland, which was why I bought this book. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations at all. It was incredibly predictable and I felt, written poorly. So much so, that I stopped reading it mid-way through the book. I almost never, ever do that as most times I want to finish the book to see if it either gets better, or see how it ends. This book also seemed insulting to women in general as it goes on and on about how much the young woman in the story talks; as if women can't help but "blather on about things." I probably won't buy another Kinley MacGregor novel after this. I hate to spend the money and be totally dissatisfied.	negative
title: A little too geasy and the pump got to be improved [SEP] content: My husband is able to find a suitable moisturizing cream for his eczema condition from Aveeno, so it leads me wanting to find a facial moisturizer for myself.After reading a few Aveeno product review, I picked Clear Complexion, hoping it is non-oily and will improve my occassional acne problems as well.This is my review after 1 week of trial. I have combination skin (mainly oily around the T-zone area) staying in a topical country. It is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and I practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.I haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but I'm still hoping it will show me some results. It is a little too oily for day use, perhaps I will continue to use it as night cream. I think I have to keep my product search going again.	negative
title: Cute but poor quality [SEP] content: Like other people who bought this outfit, we had the same problem where the pants ripped on the inseam. I had bought 2 of these costumes for 2 my nephews since they love playing soldiers. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing it, the inseam ripped on one of the pants and all he did was walk around the house in it. The second pair lasted a day before the same thing happened. My mom had stitched the pants back up for the boys and so far everything still seems intact. They really love the outfits so I hope it last a little longer.	negative
title: Hopelessly Outdated [SEP] content: Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not "somewhat" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted "modern" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a "hero," this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a "hero."	negative
title: disappointing [SEP] content: The Eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, Tolnedrans are materialistic, Angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) What this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to Eddings' work! For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book.	negative
title: this album blows [SEP] content: If you want to blow chucks for over 60 minutes, get this album. Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life. This is an insult to rock music. I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever. Save your money and buy a CD worth while like Pearl Jam's 'Ten' or Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' because this is garbage.	negative
title: Beautiful but useless [SEP] content: I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!	negative
title: Only for those with an odd mind [SEP] content: This is like the muppets on acid. I think the average person would not enjoy this movie. I found it odd and did not enjoy it.I am a fan of peter jackson and I did like dead alive.The puppets are well done and the music is appropriate. Maybe this is much funnier if you are under the influence of something...	negative
title: boring movie [SEP] content: this movie in not good and is boring I don't recommend this movie no for the they want to watch the real creature	negative
title: waste of money! go to walmart! [SEP] content: They fell part in less then a week there crap made for a dime sold way over what they should be I might as well have whiped my a** with the ten I spent on this crap go to walmart get real ones for same price these suck!	negative
title: Good for a disposable printer, it just doesn't last long [SEP] content: After owning a seperate scanner and printer for awhile, I bought this combined unit to save some desk space. The price seemed right, and I didn't need the extra fancy features of the more expensive units, such as the LCD screen etc.To me, HP should have removed the memory card slots and put more engineering into the paper feed tray. My unit has worked flawlessly for about a year (or maybe less). I was very excited about the copy feature and scanner as it worked so well.But now as I sit, the paper tray will not feed paper. One sheet, multiple sheets, the tray will not grab the paper. I suspect to fix this unit, it will cost more than what I paid for it originally. The scanner still works wonderfully.If you search online, there are some other people that have experienced this same thing. I haven't even burned thru the original ink cartridges yet. Very disappointing.	negative
title: Be wary of these discs [SEP] content: While I'll admit that the price is right: $100 for 100 discs and that the printable surface is superb using an Epson R300 direct to cd/dvd printer... I've had many failures burning a full DVD with this particular brand. My other burns that only make use of 25 to 50% of the disc were great, no problems. It's just when I burn a DVD that has about 4.36 gigs on it that problems arise, with skipping, stuttering and sometimes complete failure to recognize the dvd from both my computer dvd drive and my set-top dvd player. In short, I can only recommend this brand if you plan on not using the outer tracks of the disc because I surmise the dye on the outer portions of the disc media is not consistent and will lead to burn and/or read failures.I recommend TDK brands at this time over Memorex brands.	negative
title: coby mp3/cd player anti skip [SEP] content: terrible product ....do not bother..you will just have to return...first time i used it it just started shutting off...like maybe it gets overheated or something	negative
title: Worthless [SEP] content: When I moved into my new apt the filter needed to be replaced so I bought this twin pack. They are worthless. I followed the instructions for installation and flushing. Not only does the water dispense at a painfully slow pace but it actually raises the parts per million from 255(tap) to 350. While I couldn't tell if the "filtered" water tasted any worse than the tap water it certainly didn't taste any better.I'll stick to my Zero Water pitcher.	negative
title: Big name author writes a dud [SEP] content: I was very disappointed with every aspect of this novel. The story line was choppy and the plot was weak. None of the characters were well developed and the action sequences just didn't have any flow whatsoever. This was an amateurish effort and I'm a little disappointed that the reviews on the back blurb were so favorable. I'll need to check Amazon reviews in the future, to get a better sense of things next time.	negative
title: WEAK!!! [SEP] content: This collection is so lame I don't know where to start. Where's Rock Candy, Trans Am, Plain Jane, This planet's on fire, I don't need love, Three lock box and so on.Oh yea. The fidelity sucks too. PASS!!!	negative
title: Good, but.... [SEP] content: Even though I like a lot of the songs on here, 'Now' should change their title to 'Then.' "Hey Ya" is awesome but it is SUCH an old song-they could have put it on Now 14 or even Now 13. I hate the way Now puts songs that are like several months to a year old on their discs. I mean, don't call it 'Now' if it's not what's happening 'now'!! They should try to get their hands on the MOST recent stuff-they should have had Ashlee Simpson's "Pieces Of Me," Outkast's "Roses" (hate that song but it's more recent than "Hey Ya"), Britney Spears's "Outrageous," and songs that we were hearing on the radio when this was released. I am glad they included "Move Ya Body," "My Band," "The Reason," "Dip It Low," and a few others because those are more recent. But....NOW, next time try to get the radio hits we're hearing NOW!	negative
title: LETS HANG THE EDITOR !! [SEP] content: This could have been such an awesome dvd, with the opportunity to have corrected the ruining of the songs with interviews thus separating them rather than mixing them into the music, once again they drop the ball on this one and released it the same as they did on the vhs version. How Sabbath could have agreed to have such a great concert ruined is beyond me. Out of the 14 song set I regret to tell you there are only 5 unruined songs by interviews, they are: war pigs, after forever, dirty women, children of the grave and paranoid. a mere taste of what might have been. I strongly suggest this dvd gets re-edited and put out the way the fans who pay their hard earned money....DESERVE !	negative
title: OK but could be much better written [SEP] content: The information contains in the book makes it a pretty good primer on SIP. The organization of the book and its content is very good. The language and ways in which the author explains certain things are confusing. I think the author should be able to do a much better job in explaining things. I often find myself having to re-read certain explainations twice and much carefully when I feel I shouldn't have to -- the topics are not complicated but not well explained. Someone like Doug Comer or Richard Stevens would probably be able to make it a much easier read.	negative
title: PERVERTED,SICK,OFFENSIVE MOVIE [SEP] content: I can't believe my brother recommended this movie to me. It was disgusting and VULGAR...Make sure you do not watch it around children due to the sexual content/scenes. Unless you don't care whether the children are exposed to that sort of content. I consider this movie one step from turning into a porno. I didn't find anything funny about it. And I can't understand why anyone would give it more than two stars...that's beyond my comprehension. But as they say 'to each his/her own'. What a waste of time and money.	negative
title: Wife and Daughter walked out on it. [SEP] content: We like Shia LaBoeuf, but every scene was mega violence with little in between. Not much of a story. We didn't finish it.	negative
title: Your Kidding, Right? [SEP] content: Most of the other reviewers got it right. Not only did the cover for the seat back not cover the back, it did not cover the front completely either. At least 4 inches of the seat back still shows below the cover on my 77 GMC. There are not enough ties in the box to put the cover securely on the seat or the seat back. The ones that are attached gave the feel the one should not pull them to tightly for fear of ripping the fabric. One of the most dissapointing products I have ever bought on Amazon. Auto Expressions needs to make it clear this product is not as much as advertised.	negative
title: Junk [SEP] content: This is one seriously useless piece of junk. The sliding door does not stay on track, it was cracked aleready when I bought it, and it doesn't hold many bottles for the room it takes up. The only good feature was the built in dishwasher caddies, but you can get one of those for $4, and a storage bin for $5 and get better use for less money.	negative
title: I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review [SEP] content: Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL	negative
title: Ultra Smug [SEP] content: An intriguing account of how Winterbotham single-handedly made the planet safe for democracy during WWII. One is left with the impression that the great generals and admirals may have had an ace up their sleeves, but also with the impression that Winterbotham is in love with himself. Despite his shameless name-dropping and self-aggrandizement, this book is a must-read for any serious student of WWII, because of the important context it provides for events of that time.	negative
title: Not So Many Collected Works of Gustav Flaubert [SEP] content: How do you put together the collected works of Flaubert and leave out his best novel, Sentimental Education? Who compiled this collection?	negative
title: Ok, but not great [SEP] content: The book didn't seem to be updated much. I liked the SAT for dummies book better for studying.	negative
title: Don't buy Customer Manager [SEP] content: All the reviews here are dead on. This is NOT something I'd recommend at all. Yes, it work on a very basic level without syncing to Quickbooks. But it crashes all the time and it has tons of quirks. Buy something else.	negative
title: Doesn't blow inside out but poor quality otherwise [SEP] content: I have had this umbrella for two years, maybe I shouldn't expect it to last very long. It is true, the umbrella doesn't blow inside out but the quality of it is otherwise terrible. The fabric is disintegrating, all of the caps pop off of the spines so I have to put it back together every time I open it, and some of the caps have ripped because the fabric frayed. The fabric is disintegrating at the top also. I would definitely not buy another one. It started falling apart over 6 months ago and is barely functional at this point.	negative
title: The boat sank! [SEP] content: We put this boat on our pond yesterday. It immediatly began to take in water and it sank to the bottom. There is no way to retrieve it...not that we'd want to! Very disappointed little boy. Aren't these boats supposed to float?	negative
title: Who Cares? [SEP] content: I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written.	negative
title: Shallow City: History of Its Flux from Origins to Eternity [SEP] content: The historical journey Solnit takes through the reoccurring demise of San Francisco's bohemian culture only leads to sob stories in the end and does little for her cause. Remember, these now run-down neighborhoods and homes were expensive and new when first built 100 years ago. Yes, it's horrible that in our time the materially rich are pushing the spiritually rich out of the city, but the book only shows that artists will one day come back again. It may not be the same as when we first came, but that's life - nothing stays the same.	negative
title: Cheesy [SEP] content: This is not a very good album. Julian has an amazing voice and the quality of the instrumentals is great, but the quality of songwriting on this album leaves much to be desired.If you're looking for muzak, this album is the way to go, but do not expect any sort of contemplative, reflective, or simply interesting lyrics from this effort.	negative
title: Cheap seams [SEP] content: I bought this item for use with car camping. It is a simple item made entirely of plastic (with nylon straps) and is as pictured.After sitting in the gear box unused a few times out for short trips, I tried to use the product. There was a leak in one of the basins at the bottom, rendering half of the item useless. The plastic doesn't stand up to the folding induced when the item is stored (as delivered).The construction is poor and the materials are the cheapest available. Given how the product is folded for storage it is inevitable that it will leak and soon.The cost was low, but seeing as I was not able to fully use it once before breaking, it doesn't matter.Don't buy this item.	negative
title: Horribly over-rated drivel [SEP] content: When I first heard "You Oughta Know", I thought it was a parody of bad female "alterna-divas". When I found out it was serious, I didn't know how to feel. Alanis whines, gargles, shrieks and mutters. The one vocal sound she doesn't make is tuneful SINGING. The songs are all of the currently "kewl" retro-60s/70s Pop nonsense, with no real substance, I give this one the definite THUMBS DOWN.	negative
title: Poor Debut [SEP] content: A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant "Russian element," which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.	negative
title: Spiceless [SEP] content: I thought this DVD would have a lot more spice. I ended up being bored with it and wish I would have bought any other DVD that would teach me how to salsa dance.	negative
title: yesterday, today and tomorrow [SEP] content: Terrible! It's dubbed and you can only hear English. It's advertised as having the option of listening to the original Italian but you can't. Don't buy it	negative
title: zatoichi [SEP] content: I will write the same comment on each one that I purchased for my parents. Although the video quality was good, through generations of copying the audio was lousy. My parents, who are fluent in Japanese, needed to read the English subtitles to understand what was being said. Check the quality before keeping the item.	negative
title: Lets try to be english with a has been english band!!!!!! [SEP] content: Please do not buy this garbage!!!!!!The Dropkicks try to be english and cover really poor songs by this band called the business who are as most know horrible.Then to make matters worse the business massacre the dropkick songs.They also allow Al Barr there new singer(if you want to call him a singer)screw-up boys on the docks!!!!!!This once great outfit is really stinkin up the bar these days!!!!!drop the dropkicks and pick-up on a new group from boston,ma called the explosion!!!!!	negative
title: Junk Item [SEP] content: Don't spend money on this item. Total junk of an item.1. Makes a lot of noise while operating. its like your Gears are moving and then final 'Thak' kind of sound2. Sound Quality is horrible. Completely muffled3. Cheap quality of plastic.Te only good thing was fast delivery. Nothing good about this product	negative
title: The Art of Donald Trump's Accomplishments [SEP] content: This book fails to live up to its title "The Art of the Comeback." Having devoting only one full chapter on how he came back from near bankruptcy, Donald Trump fails to give his audience a proper perspective on the ingredients of coming back. His theme, like his other two books, is basically about all his acquisitions. If you truly are looking for a book about the inside secrets of negotiations, business practices, and real estate finance, don't buy this book. Instead, try to get his first book "The Art of the Deal." Now, that's a book you can learn a thing or two from.	negative
title: Not at all sufficient [SEP] content: I just got out of the test and was cursing this book the whole time. The information in this book is not even close to sufficient for what you need to know on the exam.	negative
title: Be Careful, Very Overated [SEP] content: A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD. I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here. Reviews that called this flawless, brilliant, the greatest TV program ever, etc. I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away. It is extremely disturbing. The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing. If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art, then you will like this show. But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics, stay away from this one. Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal "brilliant and entertaining." If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too. Otherwise think twice before buying this title.	negative
title: The Politics of Money [SEP] content: A definitive statement from the 1980s music scene has been altered to the point of being a "new" and vastly inferior.Then embroiled in litigation over royalty payments that pitted bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake against Ozzy Osbourne, the 2002 reissue replaced the performances of the pair with bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin. The "new" album muddles the rhythm section to the point of making such incredible tracks like Crazy Train. Mr. Crowley and Goodbye to Romance sound like a medicre cover band at the corner bar on a slow Wednesday night.New fans may never hear the real music, since the original masters have been removed from the marketplace and replaced for all the wrong reasons. That an artist attempts to rewrite history is disturbing...that it cheapens what was a classic hard rock release is disgusting.	negative
title: Cheaply Made [SEP] content: This product is good theoretically but in reality is a piece of crap. Cheaply put together so that the cord would easily fall off.	negative
title: This book is the worst I've read. [SEP] content: I make candles and export them for a living. I read a lot of wax candle and gel candle making books ... ! It doesn't fit for anyone one at all, be it an amateur or an intermediate level crafter. Believe me, it's best for you to avoid buying this book. It's not worth your money and time reading.	negative
title: Great Editorials not so "great" [SEP] content: Aside from the editorials included, the writing is dry and often convoluted. The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection. Thus, this book perpetuates a subtle stereotype that women have worked for years to destroy: that "greatness" can only be achieved by or associated with men.Look to this book for a one-sided interpretation of editorial writers and history.	negative
title: bloody disaster [SEP] content: heavy handed and dull, the women were not likeable and neither was the guy, cute intro scene with the fluffy pink pen...that's about it.	negative
title: DIDN'T WORK VERY LONG [SEP] content: I was going to keep looking for this item and reorder it when it became available until I read the review from lady from Louisville, Kentucky. Just like her I had this oven for about three or four months - used it about five times and it just quit heating up. Maybe the manufacturer should look into this. I too, had thought that I may have gotten a dudd until I read her review.Diane -	negative
title: Elements burnt out after 14 months [SEP] content: Owned this toaster oven for 14 months when all of the bottom heating elements burnt out and the top ones are going too. There is no way to repair it, and the 12 month warranty is expired, so have to trash it. I do not recommend purchasing this item.	negative
title: Major rules with little league binding. [SEP] content: The rule book is pretty straight foward and easy to use but useless because of its self destructing binding. Open the book fully to a page and you're likely to lose that page as it separates from the "stick-um" type binding. This is not the handy reference guide you'd like to pack in your team bag for frequent inquiries. [....]Better still, buy a rule book in a book store where you can hold it, flip through the pages and imagine it holding up through many challenging game situations.	negative
title: Just OK [SEP] content: I ordered this book because of the good reviews, expecting a great book full of spells.There aren't many spells however, like the cover implies. Instead the author gives his knowledge of herbs, incenses and oils and what each can be used for.Spoken and Written spells seems to give a few spells worth trying, but overall, if you're looking for an actual "spell book", this isn't the one unless you like to go herb/incense/oil hunting.I returned the book the next day.	negative
title: Don't believe the hype... [SEP] content: In addition to what David wrote above, the book has no colour photos (other than in the covers) and even the historical photos aren't that many.Most of it consists of close up shots of museum and private collection exhibits. Lack of drawings is a serious disadvantage and I still don't understand why South Lebanese Army and Ugandan tanks were not covered (they were Israeli sourced and saw combat service) when Chilean Shermans get an entire chapter. To sum up, save your money for the Lioness and Lion of the Line series and leave Gannon's book to the collectors.	negative
title: I am concerned. [SEP] content: This product was the tops with us. We absolutely loved it and it saved us so much time. However, after only owning it 6 months, my 12 year old son used it and the plug started on fire. We were using a normal outdoor extension cord,He could of got electricuted.I am concerned this might happen to someone else too.And... I am not sure what to do with the machine we have.	negative
