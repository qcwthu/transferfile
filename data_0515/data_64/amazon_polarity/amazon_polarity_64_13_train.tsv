title: Not good [SEP] content: Did not like the book really boring might be a classic .but I'm to good for this horrid book sorry	negative
title: Not Worth It, Get the Neat Instead! [SEP] content: I got the diaper genie before my daughter was born. We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always "escaped". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!	negative
title: a waste of money [SEP] content: I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.	negative
title: JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS! [SEP] content: I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic "flashbacks" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one "enlightened" person mentioned in the book had "higher" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible.	negative
title: Left me wanting [SEP] content: I just finished True Believer and I am so glad that I got this from the library, rather than purchasing it.It makes for an enjoyable read, but it seemed rather shallow & superficial. I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong.	negative
title: I'd give ATI NO stars if I could... [SEP] content: This company will tell you that the card is in stock... They lie to the hands that feed them. The products are good if you can get one. I am never going to give ATI my $$ again.	negative
title: Headsets Fall Apart [SEP] content: The sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. The cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if I ever wear them. I needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....I expect better for $300![Look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]	negative
title: The Duprees All time greatest hits CD audio [SEP] content: I ordered this audio cd for my husband who has two songs on a Doo Wop VHS of the Duprees singing his favorite two songs.Since the cover said all-time greatest hits, I thought it would be great as a gift for him.He was totally disappointed. The cd had his two favorite songs. The rest he had never heard of or they had been recorded by other singers who did a much better job of recording the songs. Not worth the price.	negative
title: Not as pictured [SEP] content: It isn't the same color as pictured, highly disappointing, and sound quality sucks. Was trying to replace a lost par of skull candy headphones, these do not compare.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: The author's intent was to display his error-free ego [SEP] content: Gen. Matthew Ridgeway is so full of himself that he cannot err. He is quick to point out his perfection by comparing himself to others of his calling, and although forced by history and fact to admit the other fine leaders of the 8th army did actually perform well in Korea, he is obviously reluctant to write of anything unless the sentence begins with "I". His book is garbage, and I'm ashamed to have served under him in that war.	negative
title: Not very helpful for our kids [SEP] content: This book was not helpful for us in terms of really engaging our kids, and we found the writing dry. There is a sexist streak too that won't win the hearts of mothers or daughters.	negative
title: Buy the music, read better books, live the blues... [SEP] content: I really resent the titles of the "XXXX for Dummies," since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy... The book is OK. Man, the blues is music. Get out there, get the CDs, Hound Dog Taylor, Rev. Gary Davis, Miss. John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies. Nah.	negative
title: very disappointed [SEP] content: I received the massage cushion in damaged position. The back massage portion would not work.	negative
title: Nice idea, but DOESN'T WORK [SEP] content: I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) And if your goal is WEIGHT MAINTENANCE while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. But you will NEVER NEVER NEVER lose weight with this.	negative
title: A disappointing production of a great novel [SEP] content: This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice.	negative
title: sold out [SEP] content: i think keane sold out. their first cd was amazing and this one sort of fizzled and died. if they could reconnect with whatever it was that made their first one so great, they'd be back in business.	negative
title: NO SUPPORT - STAY AWAY [SEP] content: I ordered tapered proxabrush refills. I received wide instead. I called the company left messages and no one returned the call. I did not pursue it further as it was not worth my time for a $4 item	negative
title: Sorry. This one just doesn't make it. [SEP] content: I was real disappointed when I saw this movie. It wasn't as good as Look Who's Talking, the first episode, and it was worse than Look Who's Talking Two. It was a waste of time.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: Very Bad Movie!! [SEP] content: This was a very very bad movie. The script was awful. The actors over acted. In many scenes they got overly emotional and cried, what was suppose to look like crying, became forced crying with no tears. Which was down right awful!!!I am sorry I don't have anything good to say about this movie!!	negative
title: Great premise, poor execution [SEP] content: I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a high school creative writing project can get suchgreat reviews, based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so. Yes, the Truth Machine isa great idea. Yes, it would change the world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates. But,this work of "speculative fiction" falls a bit short of impressive on the storytelling front. Thecharacters are one-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and the dialogue wooden. As apremise for a story, it's great: recommended. As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed.	negative
title: Disappointing, sorely lacking in details [SEP] content: After reading the positive reviews on this book, I hoped this book would tell me things MSDN did not. How wrong I was. There is more information on MSDN than can be found in this book. For example, in Chapter 1, the author lists the function ExecuteInDomain, referring to Chapter 7 for details. In Chapter 7, the ExecuteInDomain function is not even mentioned. Also, the author often leaves out crucial details that would allow you to actually understand the point he is trying to make.	negative
title: the partial image of a ghost of a story [SEP] content: I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of "A Jolly Corner"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion."Washington Square" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form.	negative
title: Norah Let me Down [SEP] content: In Summary - Pretty Lame.She should stick to what she does well - singing other peopls songs.This one doesnt sound like the previous albums, doesnt show case Norah's voice. Just a rich brat complaining.	negative
title: A lot of interesting stuff not here [SEP] content: C;mon Sire! There's way more interesting stuff than this! Where is "Ave Maria" by West India Company or "Stop!" by Data or "Close Your Eyes" by Deborah Harry or "Uncertain Smile" by The The or "Big Hollow Man" by Danielle Dax.	negative
title: did not work [SEP] content: After all the good reviews I thought I was going to get a quality toy... I guess it's a gamble.. Ours worked for a few minutes then stopped working.. Batteries replaced but no luck... Paid full price and shipping so I wasn't pleased.	negative
title: Not worth your time [SEP] content: The two best things I can say about this movie are 1) it is very short, and 2) I rented it so can return it asap. I don't watch movies like this for the plot (good thing!) or the cast, but for the special effects. Which in this case means a whole lot of camera shaking. It makes no sense, there are way too many holes in it, and what in the world is up with Judd Nelson's hair?	negative
title: Waste of Time [SEP] content: Starting homeschooling my 4, 8 & 6 year olds and was wondering what to teach when they need to learn things and where can I find this information. This book did not contain that information is lists books and other information that you can find your self online or in basic homeschooling books. So its just sitting on my shelf collecting dust.	negative
title: Mount incompatible with other Kidde alarms [SEP] content: I bought this alarm hoping it would be an upgrade from the EXTREMELY poor-quality Kidde alarms that came with our house (they are supposedly 3 years old but most have already failed catastrophically - they are Kidde 0915 if you are in the same situation). However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier. It won't.	negative
title: I would have given it a 0. [SEP] content: This has got to be the worst Star Wars book ever.I swear it was a chore reading it.The characters acted nothing like the ones we have come to love(i.e.Luke manipulating his image in Han's mind),they felt like total strangers!The description sounded good,the book could've been good, alas it sucked.Keep away from this book.It will feel like you are doing a chore reading it;save your time and go read a Zahn or Anderson novel.	negative
title: What is so funny? [SEP] content: Please look the back of the DVD cover and see if they have subtitles or CC (Closed Captions). I am deaf and want to read what they are saying.I appreicated it and thank you.	negative
title: Future of Metal, What a joke [SEP] content: These guys are terrible, theyre decent musicians but that doesnt make them a good bandthey are pretty much a second rate metallica clone with some of the worst vocals evermetallcore is becoming the new, nu-metal	negative
title: Each book just gets worse... [SEP] content: I remember the "good old days" when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!	negative
title: Huge letdown [SEP] content: I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent "uplifting" family film, opt for "The Sandlot."	negative
title: Glad the hype is OVER! [SEP] content: This CD is ok but doesn't draw much attention - especially after the nauseating overkill exposure it received. Hasn't anyone ever heard mindless pop before? However, "Puffy Little Shoes" is both pixilated and intriguing, a recherche moue of a tiny tune. But let's just say "enough" to the Michael Jacksons of Seattle music, ok? Thank you.	negative
title: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT [SEP] content: I should have heeded the warnings of reviews on previous versions of this movie. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations for this compilation. Whatever the reason was, I felt a little "let down" when i finally viewed this DVD. I have been wanting to see one of these movies for about 15 years now since they started the tour. I was intrigued by the name "sick and twisted animation" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an "official grown-up" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats. If you like a guy named Bill Plympton, then maybe you will like this as several of the sketches are from him, otherwise I have to give this a big thuymbs down.	negative
title: Dreadful [SEP] content: Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, and so on, and so on, and so on...Put in some nice special effects and support it with booming sound and you have the so-called "masterpiece" LOTR.	negative
title: Liked their original formula better [SEP] content: I had been using their original cleaner premixed in the little plastic jars and loved it for years so I ordered several of these little packets for my daughter and I. It is not the same. It cleans well, but the formula gets very thick and gel-like very fast with thick clumps so that you have to add hot water. I used a brand new container just once on diamond studs and then two weeks later went to use it again, and it was all thick and cloudy and gross looking.	negative
title: Sadly Not Well Made. [SEP] content: I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though.	negative
title: This book is a piece of... [SEP] content: You will not know what I mean untill you buy and use this book. It is not meant for first semester students as the review mentioned. It sucks...examples are so hard, and approach used in the book in so difficult to understand	negative
title: I resent what this implies! [SEP] content: Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected "just for me?" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway.	negative
title: Will not work on PS3!!!! [SEP] content: I was really disappointed to find out that this edition of the film will not work on the ps3. Being that the PS3 is the only blu-ray player I own, this movie was unwatchable for me.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: For $5.oo don't expect good quality. My 4 yo liked it but got tired of it. It has 3 voice settings which pretty much sounded the same to me.The only thing I like about this product is that it's size is perfect for my 4yo son. Not really a good bday present ..but could be a good bday party treat.	negative
title: "I felt like I was visiting Milwaukee, my hometown." [SEP] content: I enjoyed reading the descriptions of Milwaukee flavored by a bit of history. I especially appreciated the dining spots of Milwaukee. It brought back many memories. Since I am an old Nancy Drew fan, I felt Beth was Nancy as a mature detective.	negative
title: It's all about the PICTURES!!! [SEP] content: I love this book because of it's pictures. It demonstrates which primary and secondary muscles are being workied during various exercises, which is pretty neat. Other than that, it isn't very useful. It doesn't provide good routines or workouts that best develop those very areas it demonstrates. Thus, it's not a good workout book, just a nice reference. It's nice to have, but not necessary. Buy it if you like pictures, but don't waste the money if you can only afford one book.	negative
title: never seems to completely absorb [SEP] content: After buying the day and night creams, I was terribly disappointed.I hated the feel of this cream/serum. Maybe I'm using it wrong; everybody else seems to like it. I tried it for two weeks, and after it finally dried it left a sticky, filmy layer on my skin.I have combination skin, and am in my 50's, I didn't expect a miracle, but it never seemed to completely absorb. Wasted my money!	negative
title: nice nail clippers... [SEP] content: the only thing that I use is the nail clippers, and because it has the white attachment is easy to find. My child has never take or will ever take any kind of medication so the spoon and the dropper are compleatly useless. The nose thing is too small and the thermometer I have never use it since she has never being sick.	negative
title: I HATE IT, WORTHLESS PLUG [SEP] content: I REGRET SPENDING 7.00 DOLLARS BUYING THIS PLUG FROM WAL-MART. I DIDN'T NEED A NEW PLUG, MY 128L HUSQVARNA WEED TRIMMER WAS WORKING JUST FINE. HOWEVER AFTER READING THE PACKAGING I THOUGHT HUMM, MAYBE I WILL SWITCH MY RCJ8Y CHAMP..PLUG OUT WITH THIS E3.12 SPARK PLUG. WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE WITH THIS NEW E3.12 PLUG I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND REINSTALL THE OLD PLUG. (RCJ8Y)SPARK PLUG. TO FINISH THE JOB. THE NEXT DAY I DECIDED BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW I WOULD GIVE THE E3.12 SPARK PLUG A SECOND CHANCE. WELL, THE OUT COME WAS THE SAME, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE MY 128L WEED TRIMMER WOULD CUT OFF AS IF IT WAS CHOKED OFF. THEN WOULD NOT RESTART. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WILL ADVISE ALL FRIENDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SPARK PLUG.IT IS POSSIBLE I HAVE A FACTORY DEFECTIVE PLUG BUT....IM NOT SPENDING THE MONEY TO TRY A SECOND ONE. I SEE SOME PEOPLE HAS WROTE GOOD REVIEWS, I AM NOT KNOCKING THEIR STORIES.	negative
title: Blah! What is this?! [SEP] content: If their is one CD I don't like in this world, this is it! The lyrics are poor and the songs are just plain annoying!! They can't sing at all and it's all I hear on the radio! Avoid it!	negative
title: WAY too big [SEP] content: The way this apron is cut, it totally falls off of my 4 year old. I can't imagine this working for any kid under the age of 10.	negative
title: Knock-off book printed in black & white on low grade paper. [SEP] content: My rating refers to the quality of the item delivered, not the content of the textbook itself, read on for details.I ordered this book through Amazon.com, LLC hoping to avoid the many low quality counterfeit textbooks shipped by many third party sellers. When I opened the box, the packing slip said "Principles of Fluid Mechanics, [Hardcover]" but the textbook was just what I wanted to avoid. The cover was flimsy paper, the entire content of the textbook was printed in black and white on what looked like extremely cheap recycled paper.I thought it had to be an error, so I called Amazon and requested an exchange. Lo and behold, the replacement item was the exact same low quality item. I ended up paying $50 LESS to get an actual hardcover from a third party seller on the site. I hope Amazon.com, LLC will look into their supplier and fix the issue soon. Until then, they are charging $150 for a product that is NOT as described.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS EVER [SEP] content: This is a complete waste of money; the thing just does not work at all. The software is good but I could not get my computer to recognize the drive. The bottom line - buy something else	negative
title: What is this? [SEP] content: What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying "we're trying new ways", "this is our best album so far", "we do what gives us pleasure". One only needs to compare it with "Moving Picture", "Permanent Waves" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!	negative
title: How's Reverend Moon Doing? [SEP] content: Rev. Moon, the guy the republicans don't want you to know about is the man "With The Plan" according to Poppy Bush- maybe his divine guidance helped shape Dumbya's economic miracle. Afterall, Moon says he's the REAL messiah! What else could explain the oceans of lies spun out by the winger think tanks and reported as gospel truth if divine intervention isn't involved? Find out more- google "Moon Primer".	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: just don't [SEP] content: the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)	negative
title: I didn't like it at all [SEP] content: I'm not really anti Bill Phillips like some other reviewers and I don't know his history. I bought this book, followed the technique to a key and felt worse after. I have a feeling it was the supplements because I never had such headaches just from working out, and I've been working out for years. Somethings I did find annoying like the "late night infomercial" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times. I will give credit to Mr. Phillips ability to motivate people but I'm not convinced Anthony Robbins won't do a better job for you.	negative
title: Not Enough Depth [SEP] content: This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.	negative
title: Still Waiting... [SEP] content: I ordered this in the middle of March. If it takes much longer, it will miss the whole Spring season... Sure would be nice to have what I paid for. What in the world takes so long to mail a magazine?	negative
title: A way to get started (and frustrated) with a TabletPC [SEP] content: I've had my machine for almost a year now. It has gone back for trackpad problems once. In addition the CMOS battery was replaced, the case was cracking and it was replaced as well. It was fixed in a timely manner, but it is now doing the same thing. The machine is noisy, hot and the battery life is horrible. I bought it as a cheap way to get into a tablet. I'm convinced of the value of having a tablet; I just need to get a better tablet. If you get one, get an extended warranty.	negative
title: You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed [SEP] content: This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is "standard" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% "standard" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet.	negative
title: Not literature [SEP] content: Red this book at the request of a colleague. I can see why he liked it, simplistic solutions for very complicated problems, much like ... Well then, a quick read, nothing complicated here, and an alright story but fails a deep understanding and complexity of societies problems. Read the history of places where prisoners have been dumped, e.g. Georgia & Australia, and as Paul Harvey says, "Here is the rest of the story."	negative
title: Amityville 3(3D) [SEP] content: My beef isn't with it not being "3D" but with how boring and awful it is,the only spooks you get is scattered, You got this guy who is a "Skeptic" well needless to say so much for him being a skeptic and gets what he deserves for being so dumb,naive and stubborn or "skeptic". (In the movie of course), Lori Loughlin(Full House), An ever Annoying as Always Meg Ryan(Why couldn't she die in the movie?) and apparently a hot well/fountain in the basement. You want scares Try part 1 with Uber-Liberal Pansy and Stressiand Bum James Brolin and Part 2 With Burt Young(Convoy,Pig Pen) all the other movies after really are a disservice.	negative
title: This game rocks! [SEP] content: I'd been playing AOE1 before this and it was one of the best games I'd encountered. This one totally blows it away. Better graphics, more tech capabilities and better civilization armies make this game worth every penny. For all those reviewers on this site who say stick with another game (Warcraft or Seven Kingdoms or whatnot), give AOE2 a chance.	positive
title: Highly recommended reading for students of Buddhism. [SEP] content: Gay Watson, et.al. edit The Psychology Of Awakening, which provides an important survey of Buddhism and science in daily lives. Essays consider Buddhist influences in psychology and social settings alike.	positive
title: Pregnancy + back 'N Belly = Better Sleep [SEP] content: This is my first pregnancy and I was glad i decided to invest in this. Sure I still don't sleep the whole night through because of nightly potty breaks but that's pretty much what I wake up for not because a pillow slips out of bed or aching hips. Occasionally I'll wake up to turn over, but it so much easier to get comfortable again without adjusting a zillion pillows. I had some trouble with the seam at the top of the pillow at first, but after breaking the pillow in a little it doesn't bother me. I remedied the problem at first by sleeping with the pillow upside down. I thought the purchase was way worth it.	positive
title: Beautiful Writing Held me by the Throat! [SEP] content: Anne Rice deserves all the fame and fortune she's accumulated! Interview with the Vampire is storytelling at its finest. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but she drew me in on the very first page, making me care about Louis, the vampire struggling with his humanity. Her language is visual, beautiful and original. Rice surprises, while making you believe. And she leaves you with a satisfying twist. A very satisfying read.	positive
title: Best deal for the price! [SEP] content: The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.	positive
title: One of the best albums ever! [SEP] content: After such a great first album, I was worried about their sophomore album not living up to my expectations, but I'm happy to say that they far exceeded them. This is one of the best Christian albums I have ever heard. Every song is full of spiritual vision and power, very uplifting. I have listened to this album non-stop since I purchased it and I'm still not tired of it.	positive
title: works for me... [SEP] content: I am very satisfied with this product so far. Ironically, about ten minutes after I put on the keyboard cover, I spilled my drink on my computer. Nothing got in my keyboard :). The cover comes folded up in a little box and takes a few days to fully straighten out, but other than that it definitely serves its purpose...	positive
title: A Great Book! [SEP] content: This is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike! I bought this with my birthday money, and the humorous text urged me to snatch it from the shelves. It's a book to read when in the bowels of "Dog Ownwer Despair". If you love or like dogs, this is a book you NEED to have!	positive
title: Very good, very personal [SEP] content: Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's "Straight up" and "Wish you were here" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. "Golders Green" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. "Dawn" is a beutiful Psych ballad,"Makes me feel so good" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.	positive
title: Fantastic! [SEP] content: Excellent so far - I have only begun reading it, but it is very good and I know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience. Highly recommended to any serious strength/bodybuilding athlete.	positive
title: A classic [SEP] content: Many people think this album was the last of Nofx's ability to label themselves as punk rock and retain a sense of dignity. I happen to disagree with these people. Anyhoo, this album is a real classic. It's when Nofx really got there s..tuff together. Fat Mikes story telling seems much more fine tuned in Punk in Drublic than in more recent things. Contains tons of energy and clever lyrics. Anyways, to summurize:This is one of the best punk albums ever and if you don't like this...you probably don't like punk. But don't feel bad....punk doesn't like you either.	positive
title: OMG!! HILARIOUS isnt the word!!!!! [SEP] content: If you want to have a fun night of laughing til it hurts, then you need to get this Jeff Dunham DVD!! I never heard of him, but a friend recommended the DVD, and OH MY GOSH, it was soooo hilarious. He is not a 'raunchy' comedian/vantriliquist. He doesnt have to use profanity like others do to get the crowd going. Jeff Dunham ROCKS!!!!! Both of his DVD's are awesome. Get them both!!!Jeff Dunham - Arguing With MyselfJeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity	positive
title: Well worth the cost [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They live by the beach and she puts all her beach "stuff" in the wagon including her son, Joey, and wheels it to where they will sit on the sand. She says the wagon wheels are great on the sand and Joey loves the ride.Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon	positive
title: Thin, light and stylish [SEP] content: I got this watch to replacethis guyand I'm satisfied. The Timex is too large and heavy for my wrist: the metal band couldn't get small enough and the heavy watch always made its presence known. The Skagen is also noticeably quieter than the Timex. Why?The Skagen is thin and light and I have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. I was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.The calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band.	positive
title: comprehensiveand factual [SEP] content: I'm a huge Doors fan, particularly Jim Morrson. I've read a lot of different accounts of his life and this was a really good summation of all my reading. I thought the format was interesting. Good film.	positive
title: AWESOME! [SEP] content: Dancehall Reggae, Soca, and Reggaeton all mixed together one one CD? This compilation is a dream come true. Miami radio station Power 96's Eddie Mix brings the sexy flavor of Miami to wherever you are. If there is a soundtrack to the vibe of Miami this is it! You should probably buy 2 of these because one of your will friends will definitely steal it.	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: I bought one of these 10yrs ago, just died lots ofrattling noises, I tried to see if it was loss screws butwith no success, so I bought 2 more, they are great.Love fans that make noise, easier to block outside noisesspecially during the day. We use one in our bedroom the otherin our sons room.	positive
title: It is fun and a nice car [SEP] content: It is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.	positive
title: Very useful [SEP] content: I am an environmental engineer but not a wastewater treatment specialist, and have found this text very helpful. It has a good level of detail without getting excessively technical.	positive
title: Brain Lock [SEP] content: Very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.I would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have OCD or not .The value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.The message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and I have taken the authors advice to my benefit.It does go on a bit too much about the world of OCD sufferers which I got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . This is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with OCD and their families .I highly recommend this book.	positive
title: John Denver DVD [SEP] content: A Songs Best Friend - John Denver Remembered is a collection of interviews with a lot of people who knew John and some clips of John. This is not a concert by John but a series of people who knew John (his ex wife, manager, etc) There is some of John's music in the background (and 4 of John's songs in another section (Special Effects) but this is mostly people talking about John. I saw this on PBS but at the time they were having pledge breaks. The DVD does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. Even PBS may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.	positive
title: Good Product [SEP] content: The product is very simple to setup for a PC. It is very quiet, and shuts down when not in use. The instructions for linking to a MAC are not that good, and I have yet to figure out how to share my HP OfficeJet printer via this device.	positive
title: Before There was Conan, There was Kull... [SEP] content: For Robert E. Howard neophytes, a little background. REH created Kull prior to Conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. What few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical Conan tale. Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.One of those was "By This Axe I Rule," which was loosely adapted to become "The Phoenix on the Sword," as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	positive
title: Ran the Stoplight? [SEP] content: Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.	positive
title: Musical suprise of 2004 [SEP] content: So much hate for the ex Miss Universe I see. Why? This is a solid pop/rock effort and Alicia is one of the biggest musical surprises of 2004. She's got a lovely voice, think María Conchita Alonso meets Lisa Marie Presley. The best track on this album has to be EL PAÍS DE LAS MARAVILLAS. I can not begin to tell you how many times I listen to this song! It should have been the first single. Really give her a chance. Some great songs. I hope to God she records a follow up.	positive
title: Clay and Ruben fan [SEP] content: I think Ruben's cd is great - very easy to listen to and sing along with. He really pulls you into it. I voted for Clay during AI but bought both the cd's and will support both of these talented young men.	positive
title: pretty good cover [SEP] content: This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.	positive
title: My 2 Year Old Loves It! [SEP] content: We got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she won't even be 2 years old until January. I decided to let her open it early, just to see if I should buy furniture for it or not. She hardly ever plays with anything more than 5 minutes, but this holds her attention for hours at a time. She loves it. She talks to them and makes them interact with each other. The house is made very well too, she likes to stand on the bottom floor and it holds her! I bought her some more people and another horse for it. I still can't believe how good she is doing with it. I'm sure it will be her favorite toy for quite some time!	positive
title: THE BEST SALES BOOK IN THE WORLD [SEP] content: I got into the sales line recently. Badly needing advice on how to succeed in it, I have read a couple of sales books. But I don't seem to learn much and was not at all inspired by them. Until, I discovered this book by Frank Bettger. Reading this book, I found Frank a very sincere person, one happy to pass on all the successful sales experiences he had garnered to readers.No doubt about is. This is the best sales book in the world. Any reader will benefit tremendously from it.	positive
title: Inspirational Book for anyone interested in mosaic-ing [SEP] content: I bought this for my sister-in-law who started doing mosaics but had no reference material. She loves it! Kaffe has an eye for colour and design that can't be faulted, and the instructions are clear and easily followable. There are a range of projects suitable for your home, or gifts. Great book, and I am in the good books with my sister-in-law!	positive
title: Beautiful [SEP] content: This cd is composed of all the background music to the incredible anime series, Rurouni Kenshin. There are 2 vocal tracks on here, Sobakasu-The Opening Theme, and Tears Know-one of the ending songs. The music is absolutley gorgeous, this is one of the few anime series that has great music. This really is a cd that you will want to add to your collection.	positive
title: Strong argument for the impossible [SEP] content: We know that the media is left-wing ; everybody knows that, right? Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think. While I think he overstates his case, this is an excellent, well-researched book.I don't think he'll change too many minds,as people who are convinced the media is liberal are not going to change their minds just by reading a book, even such a persuasive one as What Liberal Media.I would ask any readers of this book to read this with an open mind and perhaps you might come around to Alterman's point of view.	positive
title: Excellent!! [SEP] content: I just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!Without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly Chinese speaking. But this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]This film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. You come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!	positive
title: 5-Star Road to Optimal Health [SEP] content: Natalia Rose so gets it right with her waste equals weight concept. I wish everyone would read her book! I've been following her basic principles for 6 months and have watched my skin clear up, my weight drop, my mood lifted and my general energy level doubled. The way to this cleansing from the inside out is simply but thoroughly laid out in her book with recipes to keep you creative as you're cleansing. I don't believe in "diets". I never have. This book, however, is a way of and road map to filling our bodies with real, raw, unprocessed food and finding our purest and leanest selves. The writing is thoughtful, the principles are astute and easy to grasp, and there is something for everyone to find and follow in this book that will lead us to healthier living period. Brava, Natalia Rose!	positive
title: Absolutely amazing mini series [SEP] content: This is one of my all time favorite books, so I was skeptical that the movie would be as good, but was pleasantly surprised at how closely they followed the book. It is an amazing mini series, extremely well made and the characters were true to the book. I would recommend this mini series to any Ken Follett fan or anyone who loves Pillars of the Earth.	positive
title: Very Satisfied [SEP] content: So sharp she cut her finger twice while peeling a potato. Worth the purchase and I would buy more of these items	positive
title: Senior Exercise DVD [SEP] content: Came timely and in expected condition. (Can't review product itself; haven't been able to try it outyet.)	positive
title: Works as advertised [SEP] content: I work in a warehouse loading heavy packages into trailer trucks. I've been having some pain in my wrists and I could no longer do push ups due to the pain. I've been using these wrist wraps for a few weeks and they have limited movement of my wrists so they don't hurt as much. My only complaints are 1) I wish they came in black because I work in a pretty dirty environment and 2) they are somewhat bulky	positive
title: Classic Book for Baby [SEP] content: This Golden Book will bring back memories and give new ones for your little one. I think the story has a great message and needs to be taught to those little children as they are growing.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Classy, Nothin' Cheap about it [SEP] content: Ive been using this since 2006, girls routinely tell me i smell good.The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you're on the move. 5 stars	positive
title: Rockin! [SEP] content: If you've never heard of Scott Miller, BUY THIS CD! He's a talented songwriter and a lot of fun to listen to. Scott's style of music defies conventional descriptions. Rock? Yes. Country? Yes. Bluegrass? Yes. Gospel? Sometimes. Whatever you call it, you're gonna love it!If you already love Scott Miller but don't yet own this, BUY THIS CD! It's the second best thing to actually being at one of his live performances.	positive
title: Why Weight no longer!! [SEP] content: This is a study guide that has had great impact on me and the other three women in our group. Geneen really helps us to realize the true reason for our overeating and her lessons are great to do alone or with the group. Very impacting study guide and program. Highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with their weight loss.	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Good stuff. [SEP] content: This one surprised me. It was better than I thought it was going to be. It's filled with good simple, some practical, things you can do to keep whatever control you have left over your whereabouts and personal information.	positive
title: Celtic bracelets [SEP] content: I bought these for Cheer Leaders that cheer for the CELTICS,,,they are very well made, wonderful quality, and shipment was quick.	positive
title: Better Than The Movie [SEP] content: Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category.	positive
title: view of someone raised in Islam [SEP] content: As one raised in Islam, I truly wish more Christians would write books like these that would help break down the barrier between Muslims and Christians.	positive
title: Thanks Again Vickie [SEP] content: Just as wonderful as Vickie's Pregnancy book. A must have for the first few weeks back from the hospital when you're unsure of EVERYTHING. Thanks again Vickie.	positive
title: Entertaining with plenty of twists as always. [SEP] content: Any issue of Shanda is going to be great with mastermind Mike Curtis at the helm. We discover Terri has a brother, who inexplicably shows up on Shanda's doorstep, and troubled feelings ensue when Terri tries to defend him and herself against their own family. Heartwarming comic book in the end and worth picking up.	positive
title: More Ruby please [SEP] content: I figured out who the killer was early on but it didnt spoil the story. I really like China Bayles. She is cool. However if I could talk to Ms Albert I would ask her to please include more of the Ruby character and ease back on the Sheila!! I think Ruby rocks!! But I liked this book and I like this series. The herb info is cool too. I am reading these in order so I have a few more to go. I have enjoyed them all.	positive
title: The most usefull and powerfull book for 3dsmax ever [SEP] content: since the dawn of maxscript there has little of no help for its aplication thus resulting in its use rating less than a chocolate firegaurd. But stop! now there is a book for us all, from beginner to advanced it teaches and informs in a clear and conciese language that at defies incomprehention. You are presented with over a dozen chapters tackling most areas of maxscript with cd content to back them up. The biggest secret of 3dsMax is its scripting language and the affect it WILL have of your day to day workflow, this book pulls the cat out of the bag by it's tail and swing it around like a weapon. 80)	positive
title: Quick read world news [SEP] content: I purchased the Economist as a supplement to more expensive financial investment news services online. I had read special editions purchased at news stand prices, and found it almost too much to read in a week. The regular weekly edition is well organized, with capsule summaries of events up front, and longer feature articles on the same subjects further back.The British and European news and political bias is different than what we get on CNBC, Investors Business Daily, and USA Today. Many of the writers are very good, but the usual lack of credibility stands out in some others.	positive
title: Awesome cd. [SEP] content: This cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. From beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. The lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars	positive
title: subtle, comical, and enlightening [SEP] content: I was sitting at Starbucks on a Saturday afternoon, when a very nice girl overheard my guffaw about reading another one of Bush's intelligent statements, "I didn't know the camera was on me!"So we began to talk, and after a few minutes, she pulled this book out of her bag, and told me that I should read it.All weekend long I did read, and I could not put it down. Intense, exciting, exhilerating, comical, a rush of relief in knowing that the end of the world could be an amazing wonderful experience.This book is everything, philosophical, sociological, psychological, comical, dramatic, and your not-so-common, "it just made me laugh at loud and feel good" type of book.My advice?I highly recommend this book, and periodically hanging out in coffee shops to meet really neat people!	positive
title: I hate Paladin's but I love this Book! [SEP] content: This book was so wonderful I almost had a heart attack after I read it. I mean I hate paladin's but the book was so well written It helped me get the few arrogent players who played them into line quick by helping me tighten the reins a little on exactly what Paladin's should and should not be doing.	positive
title: Right on target yet someting missing [SEP] content: The book had been in the making at Stanford for some time. I happened to use a manuscript of it in 1991 at Virginia Tech. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity. The book surely makes a useful companion to a plasticity textbook.It is disheartening to see that the numerical schemes for the integration of the constitutive equations of the endochronic theory are missing from the book.	positive
title: Love this book!! [SEP] content: Amazing book! I've read this to my children and give this book as gifts! It's a wonderful gift to give!!	positive
title: It really works [SEP] content: I bought the air revitalizer because I have dogs and a cat and I didn't want my house to smell like I have dogs and cats! When I bought it, I lived in a one story house. It worked great. (The only scent I've used is vanilla.) I don't think the sound is too loud, but I lived in a large house. When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. I placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. I am impressed and very glad that I have it.	positive
title: Loved It! [SEP] content: What a good book! It is the story of a medival man turned into a vampire. The book is set in the modern world, but flashes back to the time of King Arthur. I don't want to spoil the story for those who have not read it. Suffice it to say that the main characters are realistic and genuine. The story is entertaining with a lot of action. It is a fun read and the writing style is excellent. I hope these authors collaborate on more books in the future. Richard, the main character, is apparently modeled after the LaCroix character Nigel Bennett played on Forever Knight. This book is a must read for Forever Night fans as well as those people who like vampires, but hate the ultra-gorgeous Anne Rice kind.	positive
title: Our client's favorite [SEP] content: We refer our clients with questions on spreads to this book. Most say it's their favorite because it relies on clear, non-technical language. This book is appropriate regardless of the individuals level of understanding.	positive
title: New in Town [SEP] content: Great comedy and romance. Renee and Harry have good chemistry! Hometown kind of movie. Funny situations and good old fashion humor! Spectacular picture quality. Blu Ray rocks!	positive
title: The Big Country Restored/Preserved & in Blu-ray Format [SEP] content: At the film's conclusion, the follwing message appears: "The Big Country (1958) Restored by the Academy Film Archive with funding provided by the Film Foundation and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences." However, no additional information regarding the restoration process is provided. A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, "completely photochemical" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same. Regardless, this Blu-ray format presentation of The Big Country is a pleasure to view and I will not fault this Technirama gem-of-a-film. The transfer is very good. (This Wal-Mart exclusive can be purchased for less than $10 at the Wal-Mart company website)	positive
title: Best out there [SEP] content: It works great. It's very light, weighs like 1 pound. One of my fans were at first stuck but I unjammed it with a pencil and its now running smoothly. Highly recommend.Only con is that when you plug it in the blue LED light is very bright.	positive
