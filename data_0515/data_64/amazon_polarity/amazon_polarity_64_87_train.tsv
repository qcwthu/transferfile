title: Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere [SEP] content: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.	negative
title: Corelle Apricot Grove 16 pc Set [SEP] content: This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less.	negative
title: good for kids, I guess [SEP] content: The music is way too "synthy" for me. In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is.	negative
title: Few words to describe how bad... [SEP] content: I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and "created" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book.	negative
title: A Little Disappointed [SEP] content: I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there.	negative
title: Amazon rip off [SEP] content: Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.	negative
title: What? [SEP] content: I adore Angelina but this movie had to be one of the stupidest I had seen since I saw Hancock, which was worse. What was the summer of 2008, the summer of the worse, most lame movies ever? It looks like it was.	negative
title: Sadly Disappointed [SEP] content: I am a book lover who hardly lets anyone near my books for fear of getting it handled too much or horrors--bent at the corners and such. As such, I've never in my life came across a book I would so much throw against the wall. And I did, too with Tall, Dark and Cajun. I can't say about her other books since this is the only one of hers I've ever read. I'm sorry, but I was so irritated by the writer's inaccurate reactions to the human behaviours. The funny parts weren't funny, and the steamy parts were gross when characters were quoted as saying,"Oh. Oh." Or something like that. I felt that the writer was just moving the story along and not actually writing.	negative
title: They were not mean for heavy use [SEP] content: I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005. The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess. This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well. Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement. I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them. Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months.	negative
title: Do NOT buy blu-ray set for regular DVD! [SEP] content: Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio "fix" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here.	negative
title: Defective product [SEP] content: The transaction was smooth but the product was defective as the CD on which the software was loaded had been scratched to the point that it would not load.	negative
title: No Bonus Tracks included [SEP] content: I bought this CD for my wife as a gift. The list of songs on this website include "La Tortura" and "Hips Don't Lie". However the CD I recieved does not contain those 2 songs. Those two songs were the reason I bought this CD for my wife. It wasn't until 30 days later after receiving the CD that my wife mentioned those 2 tracks were not on the CD; therefore I cannot return or exchange this CD for the correct version anymore. Please watch out for that when you order this CD. It seems Amazon is shipping the original version of the CD which did not do so well without the Bonus tracks.	negative
title: I should have read the reviews! [SEP] content: Yep, they're right. 100% correct...These lids don't seal at all! Buyer beware. Don't assume that just because it has the Rubbermaid name (which is usually a good choice), that it is a good product. It isn't. Markedly below what I have come to expect from Rubbermaid. And I can't return it because I got this container and then didn't use it for about 2 months. Oh well...at least I didn't pay that much.	negative
title: breaks easily and has bad warrenty [SEP] content: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out	negative
title: Buyers Beware [SEP] content: These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent."Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble	negative
title: Beautiful but useless [SEP] content: I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!	negative
title: MicroSuede Down Throw Brown [SEP] content: Unfortunately, an alternative to the product I ordered was sent to me. Alternative was not acceptable. Am presently working with merchant regarding refund. Spokesperson from merchant has been very prompt and courteous.	negative
title: an unsatisfactory purchase [SEP] content: This tension rod is thin and very weak. It could not hold itself up. Sadly, I will be returning it.	negative
title: What a waste of a cd [SEP] content: If you buy this cd, you like to throw away your cash. Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: Dirty, pages bent over - really used! [SEP] content: As above. I will use it but have to sanitize it first. Only bad experience I've had in the past 25+ years.	negative
title: Written for a twelve year old girl. [SEP] content: I buy my books based on reviews by Amazon. After having read 1/3 of the book, I decided to reread the reviews again and I wouldn't doubt that they are written by the author or her friends and almost all are dated around the same time period. One reviewer stated some drivel about being unable to sleep without the light on again or some such nonsense. This book is "simple". Emily did this or Emily did that. The couple were professing there love on their first date. No suspense. Nothing but boredom. I don't plan on reading the rest of this book and I'm angry that I even spent a dime on it. So beware if you are thinking on purchasing this book and look at the dates on the reviews. I should have guessed these reviews were false d/t the 11 five star reviews. Come on! Not one person gave it less? I tried to find something else she had written and was unable to. Probably because the publisher wasn't going to take a chance on losing more money.	negative
title: Not impressed at all. [SEP] content: I was first introduced to Rachael Davis at the Smoky Hill River Festival in Salina, Kansas (where I'm from) back in 2005. Everyone kept raving about, "oh, she's got a great voice and an extraordinary talent, and she's a great guitarist, blah, blah, blah". Well, I bought the album taking everyone else's advice. I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better.	negative
title: Not a very powerful heater for its size. [SEP] content: I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that.	negative
title: I REALLY tried... [SEP] content: Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, "He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out.	negative
title: Great Idea - disappointing product [SEP] content: I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.	negative
title: Very Poor Quality [SEP] content: Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money.	negative
title: Worked ok for a week, then bit the dust [SEP] content: Would not recommend this transmitter. It worked ok, but there was way more static than my previous one. Worked for about one week - now it won't turn on at all. Maybe I just got a defective one.	negative
title: Horrid Version [SEP] content: If you are a fan, avoid the DERAM versions at all cost. If you are new to the Moody Blues music, then get whatever version you can to just experience the experience.Unfortunely, the Deram discs (at least the ones I have) suffer from a bad mix. Sounding muted at the dynamic tracks, and then way over the top on surround stage with no center stage on other tracks. (of course I know it was recorded on quad to begin with, but how can you almost completely lose some of the spoken parts?)I've heard much better from lesser disks on lesser systems.Point being that this is supposed to be a "better" version. "[ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED]"NOT even close!!	negative
title: Good Idea, Ineptly Done [SEP] content: I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on "The Switch," won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart.	negative
title: I never got it [SEP] content: HI I never got the baby pool and I didnt know who to call to let you know I didnt get it I would like If I can get that pool some time soon seen as I paid for it if you have any questions to ask me call me at 508 540 4272 I would really like that alot thank you so muchChristina Jones	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: Not exactly for dummies [SEP] content: I bought this book after purchasing another book on Frontpage that was way over my head. I bought it thinking that it would be basic enough to begin to learn how to use Frontpage but it is not. It is similar to the other book describing features of Frontpage that I do not understand. I have used other "Dummies" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that "it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage.	negative
title: Fell Apart in Less Than 60 Days [SEP] content: I have had good luck with this product in the past, but the latest one tore apart at one of the seams. It was used for maybe 50 hours of exercise. Because Amazon does not allow returns after 30 days, I am out of luck, and out $12.	negative
title: Not too great... [SEP] content: We bought this cord to plug into our Sony car stereo so we could listen to our MP3 players over the car stereo system. The cord doesn't make a very good connection, and frequently has to be jiggled to get both channels of sound. It is very annoying. I would recommend getting a more expensive cable if you want good, consistent sound quality.	negative
title: Uber Aweful! No Flavor Here... [SEP] content: When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped.	negative
title: Why? [SEP] content: I am personally tired of all the "Women are wonderful, Men are horrible" rhetoric, sheist. This movie is a complete waste of time, and plastic used to make the DVD. Ask an honest question. If men are dogs, what are you calling his parents, in particular, his mother?I'undi.	negative
title: Context is everything [SEP] content: I read this book before Frey revealed that it was fiction, and kept thinking, there is no way that this could be true. It did hold my attention, but in that "truth is stranger than fiction" way. Once you know that it really isn't true, its just a badly written and improbable tale made up by an idiot.	negative
title: Calphalon Convenience but Poor Baking Results [SEP] content: After several weeks of use, I've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges. This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets don't seem to allow for any workaround, i.e. lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon, they clean up very easily but what's the point if you can't trust them with your food in the first place?PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of "surprise" burnt items.	negative
title: John's Gone Hollywood! [SEP] content: The Street Lawyer is a disappointing LITTLE book that reads, to me, more like a 90-minute, cookie-cutter movie script and not the full-length, page-turning novel I'd expect from someone capable of A Time to Kill or The Partner. The opinions expressed by the author appeared long ago in The Communist Manifesto, there's no character development, and the loose ends left in end are too numerous to mention.If you can't wait for a copy at the library, at least wait for the paperback.	negative
title: When everything is just average... [SEP] content: Compared to HITNF, Q2k & Tribe, this must be their best album so far, but if you just listened to the complexity of OM I, the sad beauty of Promised Land, the energy of Warning, or the divine tech-metal of Rage for Order, even the more commercial Empire, you will be sadly dissapointed. Do yourself a favour, check out Pain of Salvation, or Evergrey... Maybe Wolverine?	negative
title: Nothing comparable to the Aztec [SEP] content: It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.	negative
title: What are these other reviews? [SEP] content: This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller.	negative
title: You Can Do Better... [SEP] content: I bought this book along with another book for baby shower decoration ideas. Boy, was I disappointed. The book is boring and the ideas are not at all original. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one.Now, if you want a really good book with great ideas, try "Themed Baby Showers: Mother Goose to Noah's Ark" by Becky Long. It's an excellent book with excellent, original ideas.	negative
title: Badly written [SEP] content: The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable.	negative
title: Disappointing..... [SEP] content: I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: seam ripped after only a few days & couldn't be fixed [SEP] content: My kids were so excited to get this last Christmas. I read the reviews,but purchased anyway hoping that if we were really careful, things would be different for us. My kids are small (20, 30 and 35 pounds, when we purchased this) and they were super careful in the ballpit. (All shoes, hair clips, and accessories came off before going in) They treated it as gently as they possibly could. Unfortunately, it ripped along a seam within the first month. We made several attempts to fix it, but it continued to get small rips in different places along the seam and never held air again. So disappointing. It's seriously just a poorly made product.	negative
title: UNrealistic [SEP] content: While parts of this book make for a good read, it is hard to believe that such a spastic person has everything work out for just in time to write a book. If you must read this, skip the	negative
title: these guys ripped me off! [SEP] content: I purchased a box of 12 Uniball pens, I even showed the listing to friends to make sure that the add was for 12 pens and not one. But they shipped me one pen, and charged me 6.99 shipping to boot! I refused the shipment, as per my postal carrier's instructions, and tried to contact the company, but they never even tried to get back to me. So, lesson learned.	negative
title: i dont want part of a differential equation, i want all of it [SEP] content: chapter one is all it took for me. no worked out examples. chapter one explains the thoery and what is happening with the heat equation but the problems at the end of the chapter have answers which the text did not tell you how to get. either way, a partial differential equations class requires lots of studying but i recommend not using this book.	negative
title: pants are dragging [SEP] content: Will not shop with this vendor again. I ordered 2 pair of jeans. After washing them to shrink, they were still 3 inches too long. CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size. I'm a guy, I build houses but can't sew, so now I have to pay a seamstress. Vendor sucks, but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano.	negative

title: Revelations ?? Hardly !! [SEP] content: It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said " The never before told story" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other "authors" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion.	negative
title: Gave it away just to get rid of it. [SEP] content: Bought it as an after-thought with another sexy DVD, which I liked very much. Good actors on this one, so expected better. After seeing it, I told my husband to just drop it in the garbage, he suggested we give it to a friend who will watch anything. Except for a couple funny lines, I thought it was a total waste of my time. Mary	negative
title: This stuff is garbage [SEP] content: DO NOT, under any circumstances buy this RAM.PC133 SDRAM. How basic can you get? According to the specifications, it should have had no trouble working in our computer. Well this stuff is junk. Had to put the old RAM back in to get the machine to boot up, and now off to find something reliable.	negative
title: Not her best work. [SEP] content: I was somewhat disappointed in this one, and I have enjoyed Hunter's previous writings. Petty as it seems, I was distracted and annoyed with the silliness of the verbiage used by the main character as a substitute for "cuss words". I could have read right on through normal profanity and enjoyed the story a little more.	negative
title: Call it InterDev for Dummies [SEP] content: The Mastering Series is poor book for mastering ASP. Consider it a basic help file with some simple examples. To learn ASP and InterDev, get the Wrox book. Microsoft Press should be embarassed putting out this material.	negative
title: Way Out There [SEP] content: I admit to being sucked in by this one. But, after spending part of an evening reading it (it is a quick read), I was rather miffed by the ending, which was really implausible. The DaVinci Code has a much better ending.	negative

title: costly but worth it [SEP] content: I long quit listening with my SR-60s because of the pad discomfort. Now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so I looked into replacements. With a little bending up of the head-piece, these L-CUSH's fit great, and I can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. The price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of Grado's for $25. Really not a bad deal, and I couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones.	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: A delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. We originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. My husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too.	positive
title: Exactly what I expected [SEP] content: Mostly older songs, some "crossovers" duplicated in other Hal Leonard fake books. If you are looking for more recent music, say from the last 15 years or so, this book will disappoint. Meets my needs exactly, so very satisfied. Bought a used copy for the price break. Some of the pages had been dog-eared as place markers, but utility and completeness not affected.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive

There does come a point at which you just want to say, oh give it up already.... but just as you say that, the heroine herself begins to question the game as well!

title: This is readable although it is DC crossover [SEP] content: It is not even near three books with death and return of Superman, but it has great ending. You don't have to know lot about DC history before events in this book. Three and half stars , maybe...	positive
title: Print Cartridges [SEP] content: Excellent bargain...I have ordered this product for the past year and will continue to do so. Excellent print life for the cartridges.	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: This Hard Drive actually works! [SEP] content: After suffering with a useless Maxtor 160 HD, this WD drive works as advertised. I wanted a HD that you could simply 'drag & drop' files onto the WD desktop icon - saved & done. Files can then be recovered or reviewed easily by clicking on the same icon. The USB power source eliminates one 110 V plug in from your setup. A final plus - the WD HD is compact - 1/4 the size of the Maxtor!The Maxtor HD required a schedule for saving files - totally useless - it made a nice hum (so does my clothes dryer) & the entry screen appeared on the desktop, but it never worked!! Want to buy it cheap??	positive
title: Mean Girls was The Best film ever made and still is today since 04. [SEP] content: Mean Girls I would have to say was the best film I have ever seen. It had great acting by Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, Rachel McAdams as Regina George, and of course Tina Fey as Sharon Norbury. The other performers were great as well. The script/ dialouge was great I loved it. It was just the best film I've ever seen. If you love comedy's/romance's thoose type's of films you will defently love Mean Girls.	positive
title: This book will change your mind about war. [SEP] content: I recently took a class on war, and this book was used as one of the textbooks. After reading this book, my entire preception of war has changed. Mr. Blainey has shown me so much that I never even thought about before. Not only that, but he exposes several myths about wars. For example, some people believe that wars can happen by accident. Blainey even puts up a good argument for it, but in the end, he explains why that is folly. It is truly an excelent book that I would recommend to anyone interested in war.	positive
title: Very good UK entry [SEP] content: While we in the US load up on VH1 celebreality, the Brits make a great zombie mini series. Once again, corporate America complains about the internet, yet they don't make it available in the US. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead 2004/28 days etc, you should "seek" this one out. Very enjoyable story of an outbreak on the set of Big Brother.	positive
title: Pricey ~ but it delivers the goods [SEP] content: Good information on the periods, materials and types of antique boxes most frequently collected. Photography excellent and item pricing accurate. I love this book and it's helped me enormously.	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: Yummy! [SEP] content: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!	positive
title: Connor loves it! [SEP] content: I'm so happy that I bought this for my new little man, Connor Thomas. He loves it. At first I was only going to buy one but I got such a good deal, that I got three (blue, white and green.) And what a good decision that was! Connor loves his blankets! We have to have one with us at all times. They're light weight, perfect for crib bedding, beautiful, and sooo soft!!! WOW! I wish this brand sold them in larger sizes for my bed. I'm very please with my purchase. If you buy one you won't regret. Worth every cent.	positive
title: Good seller good product [SEP] content: I mistyped my shipping address but Cables Unlimited corrected the problem immediately and re-shipped at no extra cost. They provided great communication and cooperation. When the ZipLinq arrived, it worked fine. I use it to connect my MP3 player to my car stereo. ZipLinq provides a secure connection at both ends, it is easy to adjust the length of the cable and the sound quality is excellent. The retracting cable works smoothly and it makes storage easy and convenient. I hope it lasts a long time.	positive
title: Move Over Harry Connick, Jr [SEP] content: I purchased this CD yesterday and I totally agree with the majority here Matt Dusk is a wonderfully talented new artist with a lush voice and he isn't bad to look at either. The title song "Two Shots" is a great song written by Bono. My personal faves are "Lonely Road" and "Every Mother's Son". For the reviewers who stated that there is nothing new and original here try listening to it again. I think Ole Blue Eyes would be quite impressed with Matt.	positive
title: Very romantic [SEP] content: You can listen to the entire album without skiping to the next track.A very nice mix of country, folk and popular music.Must have album for dinner parties!!!One of the greatest voices I have ever heard.	positive
title: Funny [SEP] content: Best show on television. With the rest of the television becoming reality tv, it is good to see something well writtten, funny and no canned laughter.	positive
title: Organic bar with good taste and texture [SEP] content: This is one of the better tasting bars I've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of "nutty" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other "energy" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. I think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. I'll be purchasing more of these.	positive
title: Great MP3; Needs work on the video and shuffle play flexibility [SEP] content: This ipod is great for storing your entire CD collection and still have plenty of space for your latest 100-2000 pictures to share with family and friends. I would like to see some improvements from Apple on the following:1. Video quality - the screen is small and the quality is not real great especially in fast moving action shots2. Must use iTunes - This is sad because there are better applications out there3. Shuffle Play is limited - It is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist. For 2 - 4 GB that works ok, but when you have your entire CD collection loaded up, it is difficult to just play a particular Genre or even artist.	positive
title: Carcassonne The River 2 [SEP] content: I cannot play without the River 2. It adds a whole new dynamic competitiveness to start each game. A must have	positive
title: loves to read [SEP] content: The book is a very good read for anyone who likes drama mixed with romance. Altho most of the time I could predict where the plot was going, it was still very interesting to see how the author delt with it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense.	positive
title: This spectacle is truly fantastic. [SEP] content: To experience Alejandro Sanz, you need to see where he`s comming from. for those who didn`t know who Sanz was before the unplugged, this is a great chance to see what is all about. This concert take place in Barcelona, and you can see his "Tour Mas" one of the biggets points in his career. take the opportun ity to see him live, and to discover the real Alejandro on stage.	positive
title: Interesting, well-written! [SEP] content: Greatly enjoyed learning about the history of zero and loved Kaplan's writing style. His enthusiasm for this topic is clear throughout the book and he keeps the topic interesting and dynamic, rather than reverting to a textbook format.	positive
title: Great help with plantar fasciitis! [SEP] content: This support and the night split fixed my plantar fasciitis when nothing else did. Highly recommended! Buy this!	positive
title: Enjoyable Small Group Swing [SEP] content: Until I heard this cd, I never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman. I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections ("Oh, Lady Be Good", "Avalon", "Shine" and "Rosetta" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set.	positive
title: Awesome sweeper for pet hair! [SEP] content: I absolutely love this sweeper. I keep it charged all the time and use whenever there is anything to pick up. It actually picks up pet hair better than my vacuum cleaners.	positive
title: Fascinating [SEP] content: This a very interesting book, and will give you information you probably never knew... some entries are a little glossed over, but for the most part it will keep you busy for a while. It doesn't discuss information from the the most recent novels (Like the 2nd Han Solo Trilogy) or the Phantom Menace of course, but oh well.	positive
title: Portable [SEP] content: I love the portability of this new Interplak. I've been using their products for over 15 years and was able to easily take it with me on a recent trip.	positive
title: A nice change of pace. [SEP] content: This is by no means a strong tea, it was not meant to be. The flavor is great. I normally make my tea from scratch but have these around when I am on the run. The price is very reasonable and I will certainly be purchasing more. For something a bit different, I certainly recommend you give this tea a try.	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: It's that good [SEP] content: This book is so good you will stop reading it less than half-way through so you can start experiencing the NOW that it describes so well.	positive
title: This lady sings the Blues! [SEP] content: Shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. I first got "Wicked" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. When I got Turn the Heat Up, her earlier Cd, I was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, R&B , all around blues. Shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! Congratulations on your Handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you Shemekia! I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come.	positive
title: wanda the whale [SEP] content: It works great just alittle slower than doing it your self.But it is great too have helps alot very easy too use not hard too put it together great little thing too have if you have a pool	positive
title: Corrs at there best and Great quality [SEP] content: I am a huge Corrs fan, and have every album and DVD they have ever put out. I strongly believe that there first two albums are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music.	positive
title: Great Bargain!! [SEP] content: I also bought the Sylvania DVC860D DVD & VCR combo as a replacement for a cheap "Monkey Wards" VCR I bought 8yrs. ago for a much greater price than this unit. What a great Christmas buy at $99.99! It works great in re-running VHS Tapes out of my library and has played all the DVD's I have burnt with my new Plextor 708A DVD Burner.Also, this unit even hooked up to my 14yr. old TV using RF cables: how about that! This product does it all that they say it will, and is a fantastic bargain. I truly recommend this product to all. Remember, just because it cost more doesn't mean its better!!	positive
title: The best book in the world!!!!!!! 5/9/1999! [SEP] content: This book is very interesting. I just got it today from amazon.com. Have you read the part about the youngest married couple or the longest fingernails or even the biggest tumor?! I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for something to read that is exciting and facinating.!	positive
title: Love this Camera [SEP] content: So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on.	positive
title: BAY AREA MACK DOWN [SEP] content: TAKE THIS ALBUM FOR WHAT IT IS. IT IS THE PIMPS EARLY BOOTLEG, BAY AREA UNDERGROUND, RAP. OLD BEATS WITH BETTER THAN AVERAGE RHYMES. BUT IF YOU LOVE TOO $HORT, YOU NEED TO OWN IT...	positive
title: Outstanding [SEP] content: Probably the finest expose written detailing the forgotten history and law behind the way our country used to view military operations and service. Much of today's understanding, regarding the military establishment and our government's use of it, is a recent development. Up until the Korean war, the military was under the exclusive direction of the Congress; but this book shows how the Executive branch has usurped Congress's authority with the public's knowledge and acquiescence.	positive
title: The Pushcart War! [SEP] content: This was one of the greatest books i read as a child! I loved the characters of the pushcart king, old anna, and wanda gambling. this is a great book for anyone who just likes stories that could be real, could have happened-but didn't. It's a sweet story and it can be enjoyed by kids 5 to 50. I would recommend this book to anyone. BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!	positive
title: why you should add this CD to your collection [SEP] content: I just returned (Wednesday, Sept. 29), from one of the most brilliant concerts I have ever witnessed! As per usual, most of us "oldies" wanted to hear the old stuff, Aqualung, etc., but I found the new CD, and the cuts he played live to be outstanding. It's definatly worth the price, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for oldies, buy one of the earlier outings. This one's a keeper.	positive
title: Another winner in this series [SEP] content: I am a big fan of Shirley McClintock and her family. I've read every one as soon as I could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times I'm afraid I will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. Shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed "heroine" that clutter too many mysteries. The mysteries are clever and beguiling but it is the the people in the books I want to know more about. They are real, flawed, full flavored, and interesting. My only complaint is that Ms Oliphant cannot, under the present law, be forced to write more, more, more.	positive
title: Farmer Fan [SEP] content: This quilting book was exceptional. It was very detailed and easy to understand. I was impressed with the variety of farm quilts. They showed great detail. I liked the variety of colors that were used. My daughter loves the Denim and Bow Tie Quilt. She plans on decorating her daughters room in some type of country theme and this is a great bedspread for a girl. The pockets add alot of character. The techniques of this book were well explained for the beginner to the more advanced quilter. This book will be a great book for your quilting collection.	positive
title: Heartbreaker [SEP] content: Exciting and fast paced. I must admit I had identified the wrong villan. The plot is amusing in places when Nick's emotions for Laurent become so conflicted. A good read.	positive
title: Excellent, Excellent, Excellent [SEP] content: BOOT CAMP is absolutely the best SAT preparation book I have ever seen. Mrs. Manning's style of writing in BOOT CAMP is captivating. She writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. Her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. All sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. When you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. Mrs. Manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the SAT. If you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your SAT score at the same time, buy BOOT CAMP now. You will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.	positive
title: Thoroughly engrossing! Historical Fiction fans must read. [SEP] content: For me, Noah Gordon has created a "time machine" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a "touched" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!	positive
title: EXCELLENT BOOK [SEP] content: THIS IS THE BEST AND THE ONLY BOOK TO EXCEL IN TEA EXAM. I SAT FOR IRS TEA EXAM ON 03/09/07 AND I MUST SAY THAT PART A & B WERE MUCH EAIER THAN THIS BOOK. MATHEMATHICAL SECTION IS ABSENT IN IRS TEA EXAM.IF YOU CAN SCORE 70% ON THIS BOOK, ITS MUCH LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD SCORE OVER 80% ON THE ACTUAL TEST.	positive
title: where to get book [SEP] content: I got the book by calling 954 597 9922. The book was a great help in understanding the deliberate lies of the Nation of Hate otherwise called the Nation of Islam. Trager destroys their arguments and shows the true authors of the slave trade, the Nation of Islam's fellow Muslims. Of course, Farrakhan and company deliberately ignore that fact.	positive
title: Post "Twice Removed" masterpiece [SEP] content: This album is pure pop! Every song is so catchy that a person who likes Heavy Metal will actually sing to this. Almost as good as Twice Removed! SLOAN ROCKS!!!!	positive
title: Good works [SEP] content: I heard about this book at a seminar and on ordering this used copy, have not been disappointed. It is a great joy to find this used volume of a deceased author, and I thank you so much for sending it so quickly. This is a volume to keep in the family!	positive
title: Rankin & Bass Do King Kong [SEP] content: Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out.	positive
title: Fans of the show will love the soundtrack! [SEP] content: If you like the show Charmed, then you'll <u>love</u> the Charmed Book of Shadows Soundtrack.It really sets a charming mood. This soundtrack is a wonderful mix of different music that any fan of the show will love.	positive
title: Takes stress out of dinner [SEP] content: This book has taken stress out of dinner. however, I use it more as a guideline because the recipes are not exactly healthy. I definitely subsitute.	positive
title: Very nice, and a good value for money [SEP] content: I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra	positive
title: Pizza Tiger [SEP] content: If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio	positive
title: Good Introduction to Parallel Programming with MPI [SEP] content: This book is a great introduction to the theory of parallel programming. It is important to note that it is not a great reference for MPI, but it does a good job introducing the basic MPI functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.If you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. If you are looking for an MPI reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced MPI use, look elsewhere.	positive
title: Wish I had gotten this for my first!! [SEP] content: This may be one of the best baby products on the market! My younger daughter will never use a traditional high chair. this takes up so much less space and allows her to "sit" at the table with us while we are eating. it is transportable... clean and simple... easy to use! i can't say enough! love this high chair! would never have gotten the huge one i used for my first (cute but cumbersome)... this rocks	positive
title: BIG SIZE COOKIE BIG SIZE TASTE [SEP] content: Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies are not just for breakfast. You can have one anytime and they are so big you will enjoy eating them for a long time. We ordered the Oatmeal Raisin cookies and they were so moist and delicious. I wondered where they were going to so fast and discovered that my husband was taking them to work with him. So they must be very good because he is not a dessert person at all!	positive
title: Great Piano, but lost the sheet music..... [SEP] content: A very nice little piano for a toddler. Our daughter pretty much just mashes her hands on it (16 months old), but she enjoys doing that. Anyway, we lost the sheet music that comes with it. Does anyone know of a way to get the sheet music for the Melissa and Doug learn to play piano? The sheet music is letter coordinated with letters above the keys for this piano specifically.	positive
