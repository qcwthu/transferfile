title: The special effects were cool... [SEP] content: And that was about it. The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.	negative
title: bad vacume advance [SEP] content: had the dissy in my car and had lots of trouble with it at idle played with the cam and dissy settings with no luck, finally pulled it out and sent it off to be tested and got a report back that it was pulling on 40 degrees of advance at idle.had it adjusted and re curved for my application and now the problem is solved, Not very happy for what is meant to be a quality American product.I recommend if you purchase one have it tested and set to suit your application other wise you may have no end of troubles.	negative
title: Vulgar, distasteful, dumb [SEP] content: There's no doubt that Popa Chubby has a fair amount of talent, but "Booty & The Beast" suffers from guitar hero stylings and a lack of taste. The CD is just like Chubby's live shows-brash, outlandish, and just short of the type of thing that could give New York City a bad name in the blues forever. Avoid at all costs.	negative
title: Chalk another one up for DOA [SEP] content: Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product. Unfortunately, I never received an unbroken skillet. On the bright side, 5 stars for Amazon's excellent handling of returns.I ordered the skillet and received it via 2nd day UPS with a 2-inch crack down the side. I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware.	negative
title: Fans of this book [SEP] content: I can't resist any longer, I must finally just state it baldly: conservatives are borderline illiterates. The reviews of this book have made it so clear. Poor spelling, punctuation and grammar: loved it. Good spelling, punctuation and grammar: did not love it. Does this matter? Well, as it indicates a lack of little things like education and involvement in the world -- the real world, not A.M. radio -- I think it does. I promise I will take the conservative line seriously when it comes spelled and punctuated properly.	negative
title: Great Idea--unbelievably bad sound! [SEP] content: I ordered this game for the kids to play over the summer. With over 5,000 geography questions, I was looking forward to it myself! We were all very disappointed to discover that the sound was so bad that we couldn't understand the question most of the time. If you could understand Charlie Brown's teacher, then you'll love this game!	negative
title: Convert [SEP] content: Geza Vermes is a renowned scholar who seems to have focused on researching from his own psychological backgrounds. A former Catholic priest who converted to his parents Judaic roots, he seems to continue his efforts to process this experience through his scholarship. Unfortunately, his writing and exegesis are so clouded with his own hang ups, that they strain credulity.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!! [SEP] content: My 6 year old bought this seat with her own money. She was very excited when she saw how real it looked (on the box anyway). It is defintely the biggest piece of junk we have ever purchased!! The seat cover never stays on. Her doll which is 15 in long barely fits (cleary states on the box it is for this size doll). This could of been made so much nicer. It was a very cute idea but awful quality. Fisher Price should be ashamed to have their name on the product.	negative
title: blah, blah, blah [SEP] content: Spoiler alert - if you saw "Full Impact" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close.	negative
title: Several hundred pages of fluff... [SEP] content: If you have no idea what you're doing get this book. It does a good job of summarizing the apps in SBS. If you want hard core, real-world examples and tips look somewhere else...if I knew where I'd tell ya.	negative
title: No story resolution [SEP] content: This story was about as deep as one of those bars of hotel soaps on the cover. I didn't give a cr*p about any of the characters or their neurosis'. The ending provided no resolution to the 1 of the 2 main storylines. The author also wasted to many pages talking from the perspective of an in-utero & newborn. Reading this, I thought I was projecting myself into one of those "Look Who's Talking" movies. Waste of time.	negative
title: I think I will by buying another cupcake book [SEP] content: I bought this booking thinking WOW! With 500 recipes how could I ever want another book? I have tried 2 of the recipes (buying special ingredients from the grocery specifically for these recipes) and I was very disappointed. The cupcakes came out dry and course. I followed the recipe perfectly and I really don't think I will try another recipe. However, there are some really good ideas in this book. I really wanted to make the Key Lime Cupcakes this weekend so I made white cupcakes from a box mix and then followed the directions for the filling and frosting from the book - they turned out great! I'm sure I will use some ideas from this book, but probably not try to make another recipe from scratch.	negative
title: Fantasy and dangerous [SEP] content: This book is a fantasy and dangerous. Most of the items on this book and all of Buscaglia books are fantasy. Yes, Leo kind of acknowledge that it is wishful thinking what he is talking about but that statement is meant for you to let down your guard. And if what he said is able to pass into your subconscious mind, it can be very dangerous. As his book has many trojan virus that if pass into your subconscious mind can wreck havoc. Just as a computer virus can wreck havoc to your computer system, so can Buscaglia mental virus within his book. I will give you an example of a virus in his book. One of the book point was "Learn to trust again" and "Love trust". If that one point was able to by pass your conscious mind defense and into your subconscious mind, it can wreck havoc to your human computer (Mind). And there are many more virus within his book. Be wary of Buscaglia book readers.	negative
title: at the end [SEP] content: when this was 1st released on vhs back in the 90s i bought it then i bought it again but now its not what it used to be its so dated their is nothing much to it, they stand in the same place playing the same songs that they did on every dvd after this - when this came out it was something cool that they have made a live vhs cause all that were available just a song from london and that was live as well, but now its clearly a dvd to cash in cause they look tired in every other dvd	negative
title: Lousy Customer Service [SEP] content: Can't say how good a GPS this is. After I plugged it in to be updated, I get a message No Maps Found. TomTom customer service is absoutely lousy. I've been able to learn to where and how to return this defective TomTom One. The company is not standing behind it's product, and neither is Amazon.	negative
title: Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati [SEP] content: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read "Into the Wilderness" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author.	negative
title: Fragrence Review [SEP] content: The product is fine. The scent a little weak. The bottle is not a shape that is easy to use. Possible a little pricey.	negative
title: "Not in stock" [SEP] content: "Not in stock" is what I always eventually hear when trying to get this product, a-f-t-e-r, of course, I complete an order and have been waiting a week. This product is no longer being made! I put together a state of the art computer in 2004 using this leading edge ram, made by Kingston no less, and it is now no longer made!!! Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram).	negative
title: easy set up [SEP] content: Nothing could be easier to set up than this remote and very easy to operate.Support is there with a phone call for missing codes, fully programmable and a learning remote as well. My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning "not possible" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected.	negative
title: Not a Rabbit on it. [SEP] content: I ordered this because I collect Spode rabbit dishes. There is no rabbit on the one I was sent. It has quail and ducks. No rabbits. Yet rabbit is the first word in the title. The Rabbit Lady	negative
title: Do not buy it! [SEP] content: Got the battery with the docking station. I only got three pictures before it went low. I have had no luck with it keeping a charge past one picture since.	negative
title: Buyer Beware, Not What It Looks Like [SEP] content: Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!	negative
title: Misleading [SEP] content: This product is very misleading. The commercial is so misrepresentative of the product. Nothing about this product is fun. The directions are hard to interpret and the "arm" itself could not crush a cottonball. Poor packaging. I would not recommend this toy for anyone.	negative
title: Not as described [SEP] content: I tried this on Dr. Brown, Playtex & Avent. It doesn't fit it any of these 3 brands. Not recommended.	negative
title: cheap [SEP] content: great series but cheap packaging wish i knew had crappy packaging would not have bought; will have to buy dvd cases to put in or have to replace the dvds eventuallyStargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection	negative
title: For the rest of us... [SEP] content: Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say "had" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Not Free SF Reader [SEP] content: Realware is nowhere near as much fun as the other three books in thewhole Ware series. The theme and tone have changed considerably.You get a feelgood romance thrown in there for no real apparentreason. The Realware of the title is the technology to be able to makewhatever you want, basically. Chuck in some aliens and other dimensions.	negative
title: Disatisfied [SEP] content: I didn't like it because it will not allow you to bookmark a page so that you can continue where you left off. Plus it will not allow you to highlight anything so that you can go back and review it later. It's pointless to read anything because of the two reasons mentioned earlier. This is the earlier version. From what I understand the later version will let you do these two things.	negative
title: Problems right away! [SEP] content: Well, we put the elliptical together, that was not bad. Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????	negative
title: Honestly one of the worst books I have read [SEP] content: This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead.	negative
title: a bad book [SEP] content: just looking that the preview that's available i can already tell that this is a bad book. some of the drawings look like kindergarten drawings or chicken scratch. stay away from this book.	negative
title: Look Elsewhere [SEP] content: Programming is very time consuming and can get down right frustrating. And the extra price for the useless remote control is silly. Come on, who seriously uses a remote control when you can just reach up & push the buttons or turn a knob, especially while you're trying to drive safely. Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car. This radidio really, really needs a SD memory card slot. Even a USB slot would have been acceptable, but I hate having a wire flopping around from my I-Pod.	negative
title: MUST READ [SEP] content: Hi! I did not read this book yet but my close friend Brandy said that THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!I have a baby now who is 6 months old and the method described in this book looks very interesting. Also, sounds like a hilarious read with some good facts about understanding your body. Nothing like a book with some good humor in it.PS- Brandy is pregnant!	negative
title: Another American Idol Miscalculation [SEP] content: There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards.	negative
title: Base started melting after a year [SEP] content: We liked this product very much at first, but it has not stood the test of time. After about a year we started smelling a burnt plastic smell when we used it. Now after another half year, the plastic base has begun to melt significantly. I opened it up and one of the power wires seems to be overheating. I'm going to buy another carafe, but not a Chef's Choice.	negative
title: Useless theories [SEP] content: This book lack proof big time. Most of what the authors say in this book are fallacies or opinions where we have to ask ourselves, "Is this really true?" or "Ahhh, this makes sense only because it is common sense." Without any knowledge of change management skills, half of the book is common sense.	negative
title: good timin [SEP] content: This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.	negative
title: Massacred!!!! [SEP] content: I was so excited to finally find a piece by Torroba "Twelve Interludes" for guitar and string quartet that I never heard before but have been looking for for a long time. Unfortunatly, the performers totally massacre this work. They have sloppy playing through out and the recording is dead acoustically. What a disapointment.	negative
title: For conoisseurs only! [SEP] content: As a non native English speaker and a former student in languages, I consider myself a pretty good speller. But I know that some people find English spelling really frightening. Unfortunately this is not a book for them.It is for people who master well enough the language and can make distinctions between various forms and spellings of English. Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: Not a real trooper... [SEP] content: This movie is Ok, with some fresh humor, but most of it is just plain old "shock humor". The plot and storyline is poor, and the actors are average at best. But, it's still is better than "Serendipity"!!	negative
title: Musical Kleenex [SEP] content: Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, "Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew." I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's "The Orange Album" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: By a CD player that is reliable and will last [SEP] content: I had wanted a CD player that would play lullabies for my son to help him relax and go to sleep. I returned this player 3 times before completely giving up on it. Every model I brought home failed to play an entire CD. It didn't matter whether it was sitting on a table or mounted on the side of the crib. It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat. What's even better - it will be useful to my son when he is old enough to play his own CDs and carry it around - a much better investment.	negative
title: Not worth the trouble [SEP] content: This product is very weak, not very powerful and unsuitable for massage it is just a toy and I sent it back	negative
title: Mathematical techniques of extremely limited usefullness [SEP] content: The two stars in my rating are not so much a comment on quality (although it has all the glitter of a 1940's graduate math tome), but as a warning that it is likely to be of value to an extremely limited audience. I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it.	negative
title: Worked great but a lot were broken [SEP] content: I couldn't find clay targets anywhere so I looked online and found them here. The targets were exactly what I was looking for but I expected to get a lot of broken clays as I had read in other reviews. Sure enough I did. I only received about 40 of the 90 clays intact. I was able to salvage about 5 others that had simple breaks that I could glue back together with ease. Still, the shipping costs greatly decreased the value of the clays and then only half the clays surviving transport made the value even worse. I will still search out clay targets but I will not have them (at least this brand) shipped to me again.	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Not As Good As Gold Cup [SEP] content: It is oil and will probably work for most Spyders and Tippmanns but I would still recommend getting Gold Cup oil for only a couple dollars more. The Gold Cup is much better at lubricating than this oil.	negative
title: great until it breaks [SEP] content: We bought this when we got a puppy and our daughter started potty training. It was great with cleaning up messes from both. HOWEVER, after not using it for a few months, I pulled it out to steam our couch, and it no longer worked-it wouldn't spray. I followed directions posted in a review to clean out the tubes, but that didn't work (and I broke off a piece of plastic taking off a tube because the tube had glued itself to the plastic). At any rate, it seems the heat box was no longer working and was overheating, and the heat light was on no matter what. When I put it back together, it still wouldn't spray, and then I could smell the machine overheating. I chucked it. Now I'm looking for a larger steam vac that will do whole carpets and upholstery.	negative
title: Not all Americans are Evangelical Christians! [SEP] content: The title, Ping Pong: A Play about American College Life suggests that this play creates an impression of life in an American college. When one begins to read this dross, one quickly realises that the title should be changed to 'American College Life: An Evangelical Christian Extremist perspective'. The content is tedious, predictable, and unrepresentative of life in colleges in the U.S., and the whole plot can be summed up in a pamphlet. The anti-Semitic and unpleasant religious undertones are particularly disturbing. The book should be avoided.	negative
title: Dont waste your $$$$ [SEP] content: This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going "old school" with a mechanical "bubble type" compass.	negative
title: Gauge Set? [SEP] content: I do not know how well this works, however, the picture and title indicates purchaser will receive two items. The title reads: "Malco FCMS Facing Gauge and Overlap Gauge Set." How can a "set" be only one? It is more than misleading, it is blatantly false if purchaser receives only one device.	negative
title: Very poor, not recommended [SEP] content: It sounded great and has great features, but manufacturing quality was horrible. The 'select' button didn't work most of the time, and the USB connector was very fussy.To make matters worse, it disconnected (bad USB connector) during download to my SD memory card and killed a $60 card.Then to add insult to injury, the customer service from RCA is absolutely awful. No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault. When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she told me that no one there could help me.For fun, I tried to contact the corporate offices. They don't seem to exist.I would not recommend purchasing a Lyra, or anything else from RCA.	negative
title: probably the worst movie i ever seen in years [SEP] content: this movie is totall junk, bad act, bad plot, bad actress, even the nude and sex scenes are annoying. this tile should go directly go tho garbage can. keep your money and stay away from this crap.	negative
title: not what they say it is [SEP] content: I was so mad when I got the package. The name for it is "travelmate cas seat", well...there was NO CAR SEAT !!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth $78, if it does not include a car seat!!! I was BS!!!	negative
title: Antonio, definitely not Desperado! [SEP] content: Really, just because 2 women get it on in a bathroom stall doesn't make this a great, ground-breaking film. So what?Antonio, I love watching your more gritty or your more humorous films. This story line really doesn't compliment your diverse acting abilities and it only tends to pigeon-hole you to specific roles. Bad move.Didn't like the female star in this. All fluff and no substance.Isabow	negative
title: Not worth $10 [SEP] content: I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - unfortunately, I paid almost $50. For me, this is the worst PSP game released to date. The graphics reek - pixelated and foggy, I was surprised at how low the quality was. This looks and feels like a PS1 game.I'll tell you how bad I think this game is ... even Need For Speed Underground Rivals, is better. That's saying a LOT.Please understand, I'm not a Midnight Club fan. If you love the franchise, I imagine you'll like this game, and hey, to each his own. But if you're a Gran Turismo fan, and you're looking for a realistic racing simulation, sad as it is, Ridge Racer for PSP is still your best bet so far.	negative
title: ccccrrrrrraaaaapppp! [SEP] content: this album is junk. they shouldn't be allowed to carry the name Crematory after this. bought this on a gamble and crapped out big time. this is just European poser metal with keyboards thrown in just to really piss you off. this one angers me every time i see it. if you like keyboard slathered weak crap then this is for you. as a matter of fact you can have mine.	negative
title: rock quarry [SEP] content: We have bought three of these, and on all of them, the rock quarry doesn't work. How can this toy be still on the shelves if it doesn't work?	negative
title: Liars [SEP] content: I have a scatmat and orderd two more. After a couple weeks they canceled the order because they are "out of stock". I go to the store site and they are still in stock but the price is a lot higher than before.	negative
title: Just Plain Boring [SEP] content: What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days.	negative
title: I give up. [SEP] content: While I never thought the Wheel of Time series was anything utterly extraordinary, the first three or so volumes were a fairly good read. But now it's become clear that Jordan is just treading water: Path of Daggers is a bloated, boring, virtually plot-free attempt to keep the series from heading towards any kind of conclusion. This is the last one I'm reading, period.	negative
title: The best import album you'll ever buy... [SEP] content: I bought this album in the UK, and it really is brilliant. Its everyhing you ever wanted from the UK Club scene rolled into 2 CD's. Its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of Ibiza to the UK charts. Any Americans into the club music of the UK should definately buy this CD... its not the best Kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year.	positive
title: Great book for the rockabilly guitar novice [SEP] content: This book does an excellent job at pacing you from exercise to exercise than into songs that play on what you've learned. Although the Travis picking style can be difficult to get your head around. I would suggest first taking some basic lessons from a guitar teacher comfortable with the Travis style, than get this book.	positive
title: Loved it. [SEP] content: I couldn't wait to see how it ended. (To me, it was more a book where I wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). Once it did, I'm sorry that it's over. It's in my head now - I keep thinking I can go pick up my book and read, then I remember I finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time.	positive
title: Gary Gygax is the Master. [SEP] content: I have been roleplaying for years, many many years. I have seen games come and go, I have seen the white box set of G. Gygax. I have seen games like RuneQuest, Warhammer FRP, MERP, Torg, so many games.Yet this is the real start, the real truth of how great roleplaying can be. You might find 3rd edition more intricate, more things to do in it, but the original AD&D players manual and DM manual were the best in my humble opinion.This book shows how to create characters quick and just start roaming the worlds that the DM makes. GET IT. and the Dungeon Master Manual by G. Gygax. You will love it better than almost anything else the roleplaying world has to offer.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: These DVD's are wonderful. The scenery is fantastic and the music is well done. I use them for riding my stationary bike and they make my workout 100% more enjoyable.	positive
title: A valuable resource with hard to find information [SEP] content: When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever.

title: Works but watch where you put it [SEP] content: Careful to put the adaptor at a high place like on top of your desk hutch. Do the same for the wireless access point. It makes a much better signal.	positive
title: THE BEST EVER STAR WARS NOVEL [SEP] content: AMAZING - Thrawn is back! When I first picked up this book I could hardley put it down. Zahn writes in a style matched by no one. The story is that it turns out the Bothans were the ones responsible for helping Palpatine destroying a long lost world. The news comes out and everyone wants to either kill the Bothans or save them. Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself. Zahn includes all the classic charactars whom other authors have seem to forgotten - Mara Jade, the Noghri, Pallaeon. On top of this he mixes Stakpoles Rougue Squadron and Booster Terrik. All in all this action packed novel has you eating out of it's hand. Buy it at all costs. Oh yeah, Just try working out who or what the Hand of Thrawn actually is - when you do read the next book you'll be in for quite a suprise.	positive
title: Fun workout! [SEP] content: I absolutely HATE working out, but this DVD is actually fun for me! I am not at all coordinated, so I know I don't look like the "Island Girl" in the video, but as long as no one sees me, I love doing this workout!	positive
title: Darkly Beguiling [SEP] content: Any collection of Robert W Chambers's "King in Yellow" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--"The Yellow Sign," "The Repairer of Reputations," and "In the Court of the Dragon"--are included in this volume. Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle. The missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: "The Prophet's Paradise," "The Street of the Four Winds," "The Street of the First Shell," "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields," and "Rue Barree." Had the current volume included these tales, I would have given it the highest possible marks. Still, it is an excellent collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated Robert W. Chambers.	positive
title: Terrific case for running with Nike+ [SEP] content: I would highly recommend this case if you are a runner and are using the Nike+ iPod system. I have had this case for almost a year and I still love it. I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod. I will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much I have used it.	positive
title: A solid effort [SEP] content: This was a solid effort, not as good as their ealier stuff, but better than a lot that would come later. This album was a top ten hit in the US when it was released in 1982 and produced two hit singles "Wasted on the Way" and "Southern Cross" and a third minor hit "Too Much Love To Hide". Other strong songs include "Into the Darkness" and "Daylight Again", which is an excellent update of the Stills classic "Find the Cost of Freedom". This release is helped by the addition of 4 bonus tracks not included on the original release.	positive
title: Wrong Point of View [SEP] content: My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive

title: A masterpiece, a mind's voyage to its own feelings [SEP] content: This film made me cry, scream, and tremble with emotion. It inspired me, it made me see the world in a different way. The fact that this film is out of print terrified me, I had it once but soon got lost, most probably in some guy's hands. I got to have it. I need it.	positive

Not only did they develop the transistor radio, but now they're first out of the gate with an animanted gay love story! And it's a beaut, all about two high shcool lovers whose relationship is threatened by a sinister Mafioso who tries to come between them. Frank, in the extreme!	positive
title: Great solution if you have an xBox 360 [SEP] content: Setting up this remote was a painless user experience. I plugged it in, let the Logitech software download the latest firmware, input the list of brands and models of the equipment I have, the software suggested a list of activities, and less than five minutes later everything just worked.I did the configuration on a Macintosh - a lot of times vendors deliver poorly written software for the Mac, but the Logitech software for this remote didn't suck. They also included the USB cable needed to program it, and since the packaging allows you to press a button and see a demo, they included a second set of batteries to ensure you didn't end up with a dead set.I picked this because I wanted to be able to control my xBox 360, but it also works with my Apple TV.Apple MA711LL/A TV with 40GB Hard DriveXbox 360 Console Includes 20GB Hard Drive	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: Just like when I was a kid! [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!	positive
title: Views of a formulator of Omega 3 products [SEP] content: I was very happy to find Dr. Schmidts book, "SMART FATS". Having spent several years researching EFA Balance, I found the information in his book to be very accurate and a wonderful information source. This country is in dire need for Omega Balance and for the knowledge to know why. Hurray for "SMART FATS"!Stanley R. Mann, VP. Research and Education Integrity Direct Inc.	positive
title: Fish Fry [SEP] content: This item was used at a Fish Fry. And it was fantastic, once we put the fish in all we had to do was wait forit to float to the top. It came out golden brown. Next time will use it for a Fun Raiser an let the pot pay for itself.	positive
title: Elvis' Wall of Sound [SEP] content: Highly relevant to how one appreciates EC's third album is the quality of the production. While the quality of the songs and songwriting is as great as the other reviewers state, many were turned off by the 'Wall of Sound' production values introduced on this third album. I still feel that all of the reverb and track layering, although often suited to the thematic content, mars my experience of these great songs, decades later.	positive
title: Amazing..Great Book [SEP] content: This is the one to read. I even gave it to my husband to read. Easy to read. I read it in 2 hours. This book gave me the reasons people act the way they do. Then it gave me a way to talk to those kinds of people.	positive
title: A movie worth watching! [SEP] content: Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!	positive

title: By far my fave AC/DC!!!! [SEP] content: Overall this is a great live cd, it contains most of thier best and most populer songs. However the album doesnt really stick to you. By this I mean most of the songs get old fast but, still it's a great cd for any kind of AC/DC fan.	positive
title: Love this. [SEP] content: I love Maynard anyway. So, no matter if it's Tool or A Perfect Circle, I'm pretty much sold. I do like Undertow. However, 10,000 Days is my ultimate favorite Tool CD.	positive
title: Convicting [SEP] content: We do not live in the same world as the first century Christians that's for sure. Maybe if we lived in the Middle East but here in America it's a whole different story. I pray I never have to endure the pain and hardship the 1st and 2nd century disciples did. Though I long to be as spiritual and faithful as them. This book has some sobering challenges about how we live too materialistically. I know I could live without my stuff but it's like sin; once you've experienced it it's hard not to want it again. I don't miss living in mansions or having servants since I never did, but take away my indoor plumbing electronic entertainment and even just freedom to drive down the street and it's a real challenge to imagine getting by without. Thank God for all the blessings you have and never forget how good you got it. Now get out there and be spiritual. This book will help you do that.	positive

title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: What can I say but PURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT! [SEP] content: This is the perfect blend of people, cats, and mystery. Braun has gotten a style that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen while treating all of us cat lovers to two of the smartest cats on earth. All I cat say is don't start it until you can read it straight through because you will not want to put it down.	positive
title: Replacement straps for old lamp [SEP] content: The price was good and delivery excellent. The reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.Always be prepared. PS: This is a simple design that kicks the behind. A creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. For me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a Works Enduro Rider steering dampener.	positive
title: Great radio [SEP] content: This retro look radio has a great sound and good reception. I was surprised at the quality of the radio for the price. It is a fun item to talk about with friends.	positive
title: great movie! [SEP] content: I recently bought this dvd for my partner. we sat down and watched it 2gether. The story is about a young boy and his family, in some parts of this movie it can be a tear jerker. This movie will touch your heart, if you purchase it you wont be sorry. this movie has feeling.	positive

title: Flight Simulator Delux [SEP] content: The simulator was delivered quicker than I expected. All parts work as advertised. My problem is my graphics card. I need to up date it. The simulator is slow and jerky. I will review it again when I get the card.Overall I am very satisfied.	positive
title: Typical Snowmen Fun [SEP] content: I love the snowmen books! They have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.	positive
title: Even Better than the Original [SEP] content: The songs on this CD are even better than the original High School Musical CD. There is a wide variety of music from the dance numbers like 'I don't dance',and 'Work it out', to the over-the-top songs such as Sharpay's 'Fabulous'. It includes some romantic songs such as 'Everyday' and a song where Troy realises he needs to make some changes in his life shown in the song 'Bet on it'. The songs certainly tell a story and make you want to see the movie. Great entertainment for kids and parents will enjoy this CD also.	positive

title: So Much Fun [SEP] content: My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!	positive
title: True BUF Memories [SEP] content: It's difficult to add to the previously written reviews of this book, since those reviewers already said it all. I can only concur with their opinions and thoughts, and add that the book brings back a flood of memories. Since my particular experience was mainly with the BUF, I immensely enjoyed reading this book. From the boredom of alert duty to the tedious flights from Anderson to SEA during Arc Light, all may not have been glamour or glory. However, excitement and drama certainly did occur during those war days. The camaraderie and friendships that developed were deep and lasting. It's a "must read" for any former SAC mamber, especially B52 personel.	positive
title: Satified customer [SEP] content: I read the reviews on this product before making my purchase...some good, some not so good. When I first charged the battery (about 5 hours) and used the trimmer, I was disappointed. My fault. Then I charged the battery overnight and used the trimmer for about 30 minutes without taking my finger off the trigger. Not bad. Again...my fault. Then my wife used it and only pressed the trigger while she trimmed. She loves it and there were no issues with time restraints. We were able to trim out the entire area of our flower bed (about 20' by 20') with no issues at all. Then I trimmed for another 20 minutes using her technique. Great for trimming around pavers, walkways, and inside thick plant beds. This is a nice trimer, but the battery is definitely not a quick charge. Follow the instructions and it works well.	positive
title: Absorbing [SEP] content: Reading this reminded me a little of Murakami's The WindUp Bird Chronicles in terms of the surrealism. There was a time when people were made of paper. A boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. It's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.Certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.This is not a book for everyone, and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories.	positive
title: Great Toaster Oven [SEP] content: I really love this oven. The toaster feature at the top is great!! If you plan on doing cooking in the oven, it is important to preheat and turn the tray from front to back halfway through the cooking time. Things	positive
title: Daughter loved [SEP] content: Nice costume, but it was a little bit longer than expected. Worked fine at the end with a few pins.	positive
title: Annalee Classic Snowman [SEP] content: Perfect. I bought it at a great discount price, the item is in perfect condition and exactly what I would expect from an Annalee item. I was especially excited to be able add to my Annalee Christmas collection at this great price. I'm very pleased with the purchase, the easy with the purchase, and the prompt delivery. I look forward to more wonderful buys like this from Amazon.com.	positive
title: The Original! [SEP] content: I would have given this 5 stars, but settled for 4 because I was expecting the Re-release version with the new footage. Its the original theatrical release. Don't get me wrong, I love the original, but I was hoping at least for both versions of the film, like the DVD release had. I actually stopped it it when I realized it was the original and threw the DVD in!	positive
title: WONDERFUL [SEP] content: I LOVE THESE KNIVES. VERY MODERN LOOKING AND THEY WORK GREAT. MY HANDS NO LONGER GET TIRED FROM CUTTING AND THEY LOOK GREAT IN MY KITCHEN	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: One of my favorite [SEP] content: This book was one of the favorite I have ever read. Huxley disguises the meaning of the book at the beginning, but if you give it a chance, you will love it. The story of the future in which everything has been sacrificed, Brave New World is about a man who knows about Earth's past, but the people created by bottles are ignorant of the world. The people are made to repeat a cycle over and over without knowing any reason for life. In savage reservations, where people live in the past, like we do today, one	positive
title: kmtcpp [SEP] content: I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his "bad ones" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the "stuttgart aria" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion.	positive
title: Very funny Abbott & Costello comedy [SEP] content: Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are sidewalk photographers who get mixed up with bank robbers and wind up at a ski resort. This film has the famous A & C verbal humor, and plenty of visual comedy, too. Lou's mishaps on a skating rink are amusing, and a frantic chase finale has Lou turning into a giant snowball! The supporting cast features Sheldon Leonard as the criminal mastermind, and fans of '40s music will enjoy vocalist Ginny Simms. If you saw this on TV years ago, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the print quality of this edition. Replicating the original theatrical viewing experience, the tape includes two coming-attractions previews (the first trailer is the only segment boasting less-than-superior quality), and you'll also see a Woody Woodpecker cartoon and a documentary short about exotic birds. A fine show from Universal.	positive
title: Pretty good, for clip art [SEP] content: This book has a good selection of classic tattoo designs, and I would consider it a good value for the price. The artwork is good, not amazing, but certainly adequate. Each design is offered in color and in linework. If you're looking for a good, all-purpose book of flash, and not necessarily a lot of authentic Sailor Jerry stuff, this book (and CD ROM!) is a good choice.	positive
title: A great album and also an awesome reflection of the 70's! [SEP] content: The first time I heard it was when I was 11,my dad had an old LP and I loved it.Agreat addition to any collection if you like Grateful Dead type country-rock. The song Henry is a great reflection of early 70's marijauna laced lifestyle,and Glendale Train tells a wonderful story.	positive
title: A great little radio! [SEP] content: This is the second Sangean DT-180 AM/FM radio I have purchased. I needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. A great little radio that I use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. Long battery life and it picks up the stations I listen to. Very happy with this radio. I suggest buying your own earphones. The ones with this radio are just odd.	positive
title: Sweet! [SEP] content: These things are great!!! Constructed very well, I thought they would be more flimsy but was happily surprised. I foresee many wonderful years of popscicle making. So far I made orange juice pops, chocolate pudding pops, and frozen yogurt pops.......the choices are endless!	positive
title: For the right audience, a good book [SEP] content: There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.	positive
title: Good so far [SEP] content: Good book so far (chapter 7), and has created some pretty good discussion in my men's group. It's relevant and worth your time.	positive
title: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY [SEP] content: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY by WARD,PETER is a brilliant look into the history of planet Earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. Throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. Throughout the book Dr. Ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if Human Beings are not careful. I strongly advice anyone who is remotely interested in Geology or in any sciences to read this book!	positive
title: Who can resist The Saint? [SEP] content: Roger Moore is at his finest in this series. His true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!But seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series "Batman". The stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.If, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then I urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool.	positive
