title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: I like it... [SEP] content: This was not a need but a want. I am a gadget freak and I also like good quality kitchen appliances.Works very well...to make MY Egg M?Muffins. I wish it had a lid..but it does not and so I use a small plate to cover.T-Fal...are you listening....how about a simple cover...with a simple handle... thanks :) This would give it 5 stars.	positive
title: Can't imagine a better performance! [SEP] content: I am clearly an amatuer regarding such matters, but I have never for a second regretted purchasing this set and find the performances and the recordings to be flawless. The Choral Fantasy was an unexpected bonus. I was not familiar with it when I bought this set, but now it is one of my favorites.I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with these recordings.	positive
title: Best Speaking Translator I've seen [SEP] content: I recently purchased & returned other speaking translators (voice phrase books / talking dictionaries) from other companies (other brands). This Franklin model is by far the best: clear, natural, speaking voice, vs. a computer-generated "robot voice", with others. My only criticism is that the speaking voice is too fast. At least it can be repeated as often as necessary.	positive
title: ultimate food count book [SEP] content: The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that.	positive
title: not as the picture tells [SEP] content: if your looking for 10 great disc of 70's music then this is the place if your looking for a great box set to show off then your out of luck the box these CDs are pictured in is not included all i got was 5 CD cases (2 CDs in a case)scotch taped together i called amazone and they sent a replacement the next day but still no box ended up getting a discount and thats why it still got 5 stars sorry for the big run on mess but it may have saved you some money and time	positive
title: Million Dollar Consulting Toolkit [SEP] content: This is a good book for anyone considering starting a home-based consultancy. I have been cosluting for many years, the last ten or so from a home office. This is not an easy transition and I found the toolkit helpful in many ways.It would have been extremely useful had I had it when I started out many years ago. Useful when I made the change to a home office and I found it still full of useful things after 35 years in the business.For the consultant that operates alone this book should be on the reference shelf.(after it has been read of course!)Murray Harvey	positive
title: A must read for every lanlord and landlady [SEP] content: The landlord's Kit is an extremely well written guide to making more money and saving alot of headache in managing property.There are a ton of great ideas that really work.Mr. Taylor aka Mr. Landlord has been helping other landlords for years...it is great to see many of his ideas in book form. The forms,letters and notices are worth a fortune. Read this book and do what it says...it works!	positive
title: Real CSI show! [SEP] content: It's just like the real program on TV! I felt like I'm part of the team! It's no graphic play, but definitely entertaining! I bought the 2nd edition, too!	positive
title: Question, not a review [SEP] content: Does this movie have subtitles? It doesn't show that in the description, but with a release in Sept. 2011, I would have thought it would. My parents and I love this movie and I rated it based on seeing it on TCM previously	positive
title: Kindle [SEP] content: The Kindle device is truly amazing. I bought four of them; one for myself and three as Christmas gifts.I have two suggestions for future redesigns:1. Relocate the On-Off and the Antenna switches from the back of the device to the top leading edge. This makes it unnecessary to remove the device from its cover.2. To the right and left of the "amazonkindle" logo, add raised areas for thumbs to "dig in", making it easier to hold the device (especially when in bed, about to drift off into "la-la land"!).	positive
title: Good, but not quite 5 stars [SEP] content: If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me	positive
title: Graphic SF Reader [SEP] content: This book has Swamp Thing in outer space for a fair part of it, as he encounters various other dc figures in his travels, such as those from the planet Rann, and the odd Green Lantern, and even the New Gods.He does eventually end up back on Earth, and is a little peeved with some of the bad guys.As The Shadow would say, if Swamp Thing is after you, 'The weeds of crime bear bitter fruit.'	positive
title: saucepan [SEP] content: Product is very good. However the handle does get a little hot when boiling water. But otherwise good. Prompt delivery.	positive
title: Shadows Dance Sad Waltzes with a Sigh of Rapture [SEP] content: The above title is from a quote in the booklet, "in the north there are a lot of shadows. there are far more shadows than people. in the south the shadows are sharper and clearer. it is easier to talk to them. in the north, they dance sad waltzes with a sigh of rapture." - per kirkeby. This describes better than I can the exquisite interleaving of the fiddle of Ola Backstrom, the nykelharpa (keyed fiddle) of Johan Hedin and the sax of Jonas Knutsson. Each of these musicians is a virtuoso on their instrument and together these tracks are hypnotic and soaring at the same time. One of my all time favorite albums. Has proved excellent car music also, traveling through the snow fields of Minnesota I arrive serene.	positive
title: Considering the price, these are fantastic! [SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.	positive
title: great atmospheric gangster movie [SEP] content: I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE LE SAMOURAI. STARRING ALAIN DELON AS ASSASSIN JEF COSTELLO.. I ALWAYS LIKED ALAIN DELON FOR SUCH A PRETTY BOY HE SURE PLAYS GREAT BADGUYS AND THATS HARD TO DO IF YOUR AS GOOD-LOOKING AS HE IS. ALAIN DELON PLAYS A HITMAN, A LONE WOLF, WHEN HE KILLS A NIGHTCLUB OWNER, A BEAUTIFUL BLACK PIANIST SEES HIM CLOSE UP BUT PROTECTS HIS ALIBI WHEN SHE IS QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE. ALAIN DELONS GIRLFRIEND IN THE MOVIE AND AT THE TIME ALAINS REAL LIFE WIFE, NATHALIE DELON PROTECTS HIS ALIBI TOO. JEF COSTELLO (ALAIN DELON) FINDS THE POLICE AND DOUBLE CROSSING MOB ASSOCIATES HOT ON HIS TAIL. I WONT RUIN THE ENDING AND THE GREAT CHASE SCENES BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM.	positive
title: The best Morandi title under $200.00 [SEP] content: The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)	positive
title: Good deal for the price point [SEP] content: I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. She requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. These seem to meet all those criteria. I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. I advised my daughter NOT to test them for water resistance!	positive
title: a page turner [SEP] content: This was my first book by Phillip Margolin and I enjoyed it alot.Very fast moving and somewhat gruesome but good.I was able to figure out who the killer was about halfway through the book but that didn't take away from the suspense.I'll read more of his books-in fact the first chapter of The Associate was at the end of this book and the first chapter was enough for me to want to read it.He will be on my authors -to -watch -out- for-list.	positive
title: Gory yet beautiful, not as good as the others. [SEP] content: I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Jean de Florette et Manon des sources [SEP] content: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une réponse de vous.	positive
title: Russo novels seldom disappoint [SEP] content: The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. I've read six of Russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. It starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it.	positive
title: The Best Peeler Ever!!!! [SEP] content: I LOVE this peeler. The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. I know they call it a "soft-skin" peeler, but I've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. Since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! That never happened before!	positive
title: good productive [SEP] content: I purchased this product because it seemed interesting. Originally I thought I would use it for my creative writing. But it has become a daily tool for many things. It is very good	positive
title: Im in my Element! [SEP] content: Hearing this sound at "Q" in Adelaide made me only do one thing- go out and buy it. Why you ask, 'cos i was in my element. These raw beats produce an exillorating felling in my system. For those who play it hard, let yourself go and go even faster. But what ever you do dont turn back!	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Thank you [SEP] content: The book arrived just on time. It was my pleasure to purchase book from your company. The book itself is very interesting too.	positive
title: Simply gorgeous [SEP] content: One of the places that most inspired Matisse was Morocco, a country of huge contrasts, vivid colors and dramatic landscapes .I missed the landmark exhibition for which this book served as the catalog, but I purchased it after vacationing in Morocco. Matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of Moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. It is also informed and inspired by Moroccan design, which combines Mediterranean and Islamic elements to beautiful effect.	positive
title: Difficult decision [SEP] content: Excellent! This really is a great collection of mixes. When I pop this one in my car, I find it hard to decide which one to start with. Here's me thinking: "Let's see, I'll start with... the original version, NO WAIT! number three, NO TWO! FOUR, I meant FOUR! NO TWO!!!..." No wonder I'm always late for work - I spend half my day dancing in the car. A must-have for those who like remixed k.d.	positive
title: The title is an oxymoron, but they did a good job of making it simple [SEP] content: I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book.	positive
title: Incredible value not to be missed [SEP] content: This book is full of priceless information about places you would otherwise never hear about. It is not to be missed.	positive
title: Great movie! [SEP] content: This is the epitome of a "B" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!	positive
title: oh my gosh [SEP] content: phenominal game. like the other guy, i am about 21 percent through the game but i found the chase exhilerating, like no other in any game. the blurryness is from your panic and if you do well, you won't be very blurry but if you keep looking at the guys breaking down doors that you lock behind you, or get shot a couple times, it goes downhill fast, but that is what makes it so intense. i wish they made more games like this where you actually do things and flesh out the story before going in guns blazing (like half life 1). overall one of a kind game and actually pretty scary and intene. I don't even find games like resident evil or silent hill 2 to be scary or intense like this. hell of a game with great graphics on my 360 and great surround sound with an enthralling storyline and detailed world. very good for a mature gamer who has other games like devil may cry and halo to satisfy my bloodlust.	positive
title: Lost and Found [SEP] content: For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did.	positive
title: Great STORY + Great ACTING = GREAT MOVIE ! ! ! [SEP] content: "THE MAJESTIC"Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Very tight acting and very believable characters. It's easy to care for them and want what they want. Jim Carrey is fantastic, too. He can really bring a tear to the eye when he wants to. He does a SUPERB JOB and I am impressed. I didn't know Ace Ventura had it in him.If you like movies that are meaningful and thought pervoking then I highly recommend 'The Majestic'. Taking a serious movie in, now and then, helps to keep life into perspective. GREAT MOVIE!!!	positive
title: Great product I have used for years [SEP] content: If you are looking for a good product at a great price, this is it. I have used this ointment for years and have had no problems with skin breakdown. Great protection for anyone with irritating skin problems. Helps protect against diaper rash and more. Highly recommended by my doctor to me. Buying this in the one-pound jar is also more economical.	positive
title: Andy Williams at his best [SEP] content: These two albums are a collection of lesser known Andy Williams songs that are masterfully mixed and interwoven. The entire series of songs related to If Wishes Were Horses and the sense of living in the moment, using a New Christy Minstrals hit song, brings back wonderful memories and provides a provocative listening experience, as well as being a window into the personal challenges and emotions of the artist at that time.	positive
title: nice [SEP] content: Mine came defective but belkin replaced it after i had to return it at my expense. the new one is working fine just don't know if it is helping.	positive
title: Blossom47 is now happy. [SEP] content: With a love list I put some one on it:Sara,Jessica,Ruby,Kandra(A little.)Jessica,too.Also a H8 One:Punkstar,(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOUR A GOTH).So Your on the love list ,Becuz you rock,Angel's gettin' on the love list!Love Blossom47!	positive
title: A monster of a book. [SEP] content: Rambling, discursive, entertaining informative and highly individual. With particular reference to eastern Europe and Orthodoxy. Norman is a eastern European specialist and so balances up the usual highly Western European, Catholic/Protestant bias found in histories of this sort.	positive
title: Kept my attention! [SEP] content: I started reading this book while walking on the treadmill.. I normally hate doing cardio because i get so bored and cant seem to get in the grove. I enjoyed this book so much that i looked forward to doing cardio, just so i could simply read. It kept my attention, and kept me wanting more.. Its very different from Nicholas Sparks other books in that it does have mystery and intense parts!	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Delightful story with wonderful ensemble of actors [SEP] content: This story of a poor British girl with limited means and a big imagination is one of my favorite movies, and always leaves a smile on my face (and maybe a few tears in my eyes, too.). The cast is absolutely dreamy, including Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea, John Lithgow, the hilarious Kevin Kline, and the beautiful Phoebe Cates as the "Princess". Anyone who loves "period" pieces will love this film. (It is now being shown on the "Romance" cable TV channel, too.)	positive
title: I love this gadget [SEP] content: I maintain 4400 sq ft of wood floors and I own 1 of these. I am buying 3 more to place inconspicuously around my living areas. I like to sweep to touch up high traffic areas like the entry and kitchen. It makes things more convienent.	positive
title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: Beautiful photos . Good information [SEP] content: Very beautiful and relaxing photos . Good articles with parties rules and settings of different festivals and with different person . Good DIY little projects . Very useful appendix with some flowers introduction, teaching of napkin floding etc. A good bookfor when you want to plan parties. But sometimes quite dull.	positive
title: These things work! [SEP] content: I am a serious walker. I have walked 10 miles virtually every day, except Sundays, for over eight years. I figure that I have walked over 25,000 miles during this time. I am 68 years old. An article about exercise and longevity at The New England Journal of Medicine got me started on such an endeavor. Plantar Fascitis (heel pain) has bothered me quite a bit lately. So much so, that I have been contemplating cutting back on my walking. Today, I received my order of these heel protectors. I put one on my left heel and I received immediate pain relief. I will keep you posted on how they work over longer term.	positive
title: The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street Lives On Today..Serendipity [SEP] content: A fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing. Penpals of sorts. A must read for anyone, but writers it can tear down any writers block you could possibly have. She is so articulate and real. I highly suggest this book!	positive
title: Wonderful masterpiece.... [SEP] content: The best movie chronicling the life of a composer I have seen to date. Except, the storyline involving Salieri's connection to Mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so. Tom Hulce as Mozart gives a breathtaking performance. He becomes the character. I loved his crazy laugh! This is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me.	positive
title: Very enjoyable and fun movie [SEP] content: I really enjoyed this movie. I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it "Gone with the Wind" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.	positive
title: Best of the Bunch [SEP] content: Let's get something straight right now:The intelligentsia loves Empire Strikes Back. They say it's because Empire is one of the only blockbuster movies that actually has a downer ending in which the bad guys win. They enjoy being contrarian. They're deluded.The romantics love Return of the Jedi. They get all teary-eyed at the funeral pyre scene when Anakin Skywalker appears in his non-Darth Vader form at the end. They are simpering sentimental fools.Only degenerates love Episodes I thru III. They need counseling.The original Star Wars is without a doubt the BEST of the series. None of the other films come close. The good thing about this particular package is that Disc 2 contains the ACTUAL original, not the bogus "enhanced" Star Wars with the silly new graphics, symbols in themselves of all sorts of late-life regrets and insecurities on Lucas's part. No, Disc 2 contains the real deal. The best of the bunch, unsullied and unsurpassed.	positive
title: Good Show History [SEP] content: I have watched the show since 1956. It was fun to read about the show over the years.	positive
title: Gets an absolute beginner up and running. [SEP] content: This book is aimed at those who are completely new to Access. It will systematically, for the most part, allow a beginner to become familiar with Tables, Forms, Queries,etc... Good examples, CD contains video examples as well. If your new to Access and want to be held by the hand then buy this book.	positive
title: perfect [SEP] content: this coffee maker travels with me everywhere. it is well made and the extra shot a great hidden gem. buy it!	positive
title: Reply To Music Man from the UK or something along that line [SEP] content: the song they sing on the bus is "tiny dancer" by elton john where they all start joining in, hope this helped you	positive
title: A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl [SEP] content: This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play.	positive
title: Wonderful Storytelling! [SEP] content: Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books. After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series. I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters. I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!	positive
title: Beautiful Picture [SEP] content: I have been looking for this blu-ray for my husband for some time. It hasn't been in any store I have looked and every else online had outrageous prices. I am so happy I looked on Amazon before giving up. We popped it in our PS3 and the picture is absolutely phenomenal. I even ended up watching it with him.	positive
title: Do not use a generic battery! [SEP] content: I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 2004, was recommending. Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.	positive
title: Best new Handheld System than Sony's PSP [SEP] content: I think it is cool for Nintendo to make this new Handheld System great for Fans of Nintendo. I mean the Reason why I said this is better than The Playstation Portible (Sony's 1st handheld system) because Sony doesn't know what the heck there making I mean Nintendo made more Games for the DS than Sony because Sony is making a little bit of Games for the PSP but I betcha the DS is going to be better.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: This product does not work! [SEP] content: Dont buy this! It really sucks and does not warm the towels. The bars feel warm, but when you put a towel on the bars it only warms right where the towels touch. Not the whole towel. In the process of getting my money back	negative
title: Soft Metal Means These Break After 1-2 Uses [SEP] content: I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail. The price seemed unbeatable, and they fit securely to all of my standard bits. However, the metal in the hex screws is very soft, and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application. But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall, plaster, etc., then you could secure them less tightly to your bits (and thus, hopefully, delay stripping the cheap screws).	negative
title: Good information, but redundant. [SEP] content: I purchased this book to assist in staff training. I have found it to contain useful information. However, after the first chapter, it tends to repeat itself without introducing much new helpful information. There are lots of checklists for staff self-evaluations that, when scored, do not include information on improving their weak areas. Also, as this book was written for the UK, I have found the language to be interesting, but a slight drawback. There is quite a bit of UK slang (such as tatty, taken out of a skip, put a tick in the appropriate column, etc.). And there was an interesting, but not so useful for the US, chapter on British Telecom.	negative
title: Not a Garrett PI series #2 [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Passage of Arms because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.	negative
title: Downright Silly, Not Funny [SEP] content: Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas. The movie is plain silly, not funny. This guy is worse than Jar-Jar Binks.Hard to imagine anybody could find this show funny.This is the worst comedy that I come across so far.	negative
title: City Baby L.A. - Dont buy it, use a phone book. [SEP] content: This book is pages and pages of listings of things like daycare centers and their phone numbers. It is also geared toward the woman who is about to have a baby a lot. Dont waste your money. Buy "Baby's day out in Southern California" which is the great book recommended by the triple-A.	negative
title: Not Worth the Trouble. [SEP] content: While the game appeals to a certain juvenile streak, the fun quickly wears off. The humour value of being able to steal every car on the screen is limited at best. You are left with a repetive game with very little plot to drive it forward. You end up merely driving around the city in circles.	negative
title: Weak copy of need for speed [SEP] content: Everything about this game is lame, the graphics , the user interface, and the very slow since of speed, car's going 150 mph feel like 70 mph! you can pump up your ride to 600+HP! and cars with 200HP will beat you! If you are a fan of need for speed underground stay away from this stinker!! This game is very dissapointing! avoid it at all cost's!!!	negative
title: What a Pervert! [SEP] content: This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been "watching [the heroine] from afar". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist."Love" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book.	negative
title: Crappy crap crap (crap) [SEP] content: This Clerks-esk low budget film is, shall I say, crap. I love Bam and his CKY disks and Viva La Bam make me laugh so hard I have to pee. This movie was poorly acted (no surprise) but the crew are actually trying to act so it just seems dumb. DiCamillo was annoying as usual. The "plot" was boring and average. There are a few truly funny moments but not enough to warrent buying this DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy a CKY DVD.	negative
title: Looks great - if only it worked! [SEP] content: This is a great looking player with seemingly solid construction however after approximately 45 minutes of use, the screen went blank. Thereafter, it would shut down after 20 seconds of play. I returned the item for replacement, hoping that I had just received a dud. The replacement player worked during its initial use however thereafter same problem as before. Moveover, the sound was never great - especially for use in the car. At full volume, it could hardly be heard above the road noise. I would not recommend this player but, as always, Amazon was super to work with and their customer service cannot be beat.	negative
title: College text [SEP] content: I had purchased this book expecting it to be in "very good" condition as noted by the seller. Unfortunately, it is in fair condition, at best. I was very disappointed. The extensive highlighting and underlining make it difficult to use.	negative
title: if you're not a right winger, this book is awful [SEP] content: i feel like i've been trying to read this book for years, but it's only been a day and it says i'm only 12% done, egads, i can't go on. the racial slur when the main character slams arabs, then realizing the girl he's with is an arab changes it to muslims....and she concurs! please....i'm stopping this now before i have to go out and buy an uzi	negative
title: unfortunate [SEP] content: i'm sorry to say this because Kevin Smith is one of my favorites and i'm a true fan so i gave this movie a shot too bad it was pretty terrible. I'm sorry but please miss this movie wait for Clerks 2: The passion of the clerks coming summer 2005	negative
title: Not very good [SEP] content: Although the author has obviously spent a good amount of time doing his research, the time might have been better spent developing a coherent plot or creating charaters of any substance. With all of the excellent books available, you might want to give this one a pass.	negative
title: lasted 6 weeks [SEP] content: lasted 6 weeks then inexplicably went out. not sure if i got a dud or if others have experienced this.	negative
title: What are you guys smoking.... [SEP] content: This game was the worst. I got quite far, but it was boring the whole time. The fist couple of missions are fun. Once they get too challanging you realize that your doing the same exact stuff as you were doing on teh first mission, just a lot faster. The cops have to intelligence at all, they just go directly at your car. The game is a MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY. I reccomend using your money wisely on something like Onimusha, that's a great game with better graphics, gameplay, plot, and variety. Don't waste your money or time. I am aware that this review is on the contrary to most of the others, but I feel that you should take my advice. After two complete hours of gameplay I was bored out of my mind	negative
title: Not a fan. [SEP] content: This particular product takes up way too much free space on my computer. Actually slowed it down a bit. I have 320 GB with 4 GB memory. Kaspersky seems to work better and I didn't have any problem with that at all. Would not personally recommend Norton.	negative
title: not the real Fantasia [SEP] content: Unfortunately, this is another example of the Idol folks trying to mimic trends vs. really letting an artist shine. Fantasia is a great vocalist and the overdubbing and layering on this CD hides her uniqueness--makes it a Beyonce ripoff attempt. Too bad--looks like we'll have to wait a release or two before we get the real Fantasia.	negative
title: I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review [SEP] content: Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL	negative
title: rock key hider [SEP] content: This rock key hider does one little good unless you happen tobe carrying around a screwdriver; that's right, the key is obtainable only by unsrewing the plastic on the bottom side of the rock. Oh, and did I mention that the rock looks as phony as a three dollar bill?Why didn't they simply make the slot-a slide version-a complete waste of money.	negative
title: Baptist bashing approach to St. John [SEP] content: If you would like an exercise in Baptist theology purchase this commentary. If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru. This is possibly the worst commentary on St. John that Eerdmans have ever published.	negative
title: Not very good... [SEP] content: I really wanted to give this book a 2 and 1/2 stars. A quater of this book was really good. The rest was dull, confusing and not well written.	negative
title: Defective [SEP] content: They must be selling all their defective units now. The first one I got stopped working after a month. The one I got a week ago one of the fans didn't work when it came out the box, it also has a short in the cable. Beware of defective units.	negative
title: Dated Material, Some over 40 Years Old [SEP] content: If you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, I think you can do better.That said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. Though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 60s.Some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in Mike Markel's "Technical Communication" or Carolyn Rude's "Technical Editing."If your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. You'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as I will. It makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale.	negative
title: Doesn't keep things hot [SEP] content: I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure.	negative
title: They dont know what else to do...... [SEP] content: This has to be another effort to be alive on the music industry. The live performance is the same one that come with the DVD from Greatest Hits Part 1. They add "new tracks" as Proud which is on the soundtrack of the movie I know what you did last summer. Earache my eye its the last song from Follow the leader but live. One is from the tribute to Metallica. If all that is "rare" they are really desperate for money.Dont buy this CD buy the new tool Cd which is way better.	negative
title: Broke within 1 month, useless [SEP] content: Don't waste your money! We thought these beds would be perfect for our two dogs, and we ordered extra large to accomodate their respective weights (both under 100 pounds). We bought a total of four beds and three of them broke within one month. Like other reviewers, we saw that the bolts sheared off and as a result, the beds are not able to be repaired. We have asked for a refund; I am optimistic...	negative
title: Failed Attempted Frenzy [SEP] content: This game is not up to the standard of the other x-box titles. The graphics are bland, the landscapes are dull & boring. There are many other games being launched at the same time as this one. I would wait for something a bit more "Next Generation".	negative
title: London Blue Topaz Earrings [SEP] content: I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, it looks as if you could have bought this at a discount store	negative
title: Three weeks, and no results [SEP] content: I been using this cream for three weeks now, and not seen any results. Your better off making it your self. All you need is Baling Soda and Castor Oil to make a paste. Thats all.	negative
title: Well it hasn't caught on fire yet. [SEP] content: It doesn't work at all. The drive is recognized by the USB driver but the RAID utility can not find it or initialize. I have 20 years experience with PC, build my own, have done software and hardware raid under Windows and Linux. This thing should just work. Technical support has hung up on me after being on hold for 15 minutes twice. So I'm guessing they just have so many problems that they are dumping their call queues to avoid busy signals.Your going to be wasting a lot of time with something that really should be a non event.Stay away from this product.	negative
title: Sorry, not much here for me [SEP] content: I bought it for some insight on troubleshooting my PS2, disk read problems. Not much there, unfortunately. That in it's own self wouldn't be a killer, but the fact that the book is 2/3 "guide to games" cinches the deal. It's from 2001, so there are no games since then included in the guide. If you just bought a PS2 (like I did) and you find this for a buck at a flea market, it might be worth it.	negative
title: Not Impressed [SEP] content: I have never really been fond of Ethics and Moral code to begin with because most of the articles fail to realize the whole point of what they are writing about. This book really wasn't any different. The articles about Abortion are weak and they don't fully explain what their whole point of what they are writing about is. It doesn't help matters when every article in this book is so drawn out. Everything that is said in this book could be done so in about 2 or 3 pages instead it is drawn out to about 10 to 15 pages. The authors are basically repeating themselves over and over throughout the entire article.I personally don't think this would be a great buy but maybe thats because I find all the arguments in moral and ethic philosophies are very weak and not at all to the point.	negative
title: Icorrect Information [SEP] content: None of the songs listed in the below discription are on this CD. Save your money. If you are looking for Polly Browns hits, this is NOT the CD you want.	negative
title: Stick to Celtic Work RJ [SEP] content: Alright book. There are better books on Qaballah out there. I was quite suprised to see this author undertake this book, and disappointed. It seems these days that no one is content to develop a purely celtic magical tradition. Are the european peoples ashamed of their rich spiritual past and potential ? Come on people, there is so much to be discovered out there from our own genetic history without having to goto the middle east, Amer-Indians, Asia, the west Indies or Africa. People should be able to get what they want out of the tradtions they have a birth right to, leaving other peoples birthright traditions for them.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: My husband has been wearing Munsingwear for many, many years. He has noted that each time we purchase them the quality and consistency of fit deteriorates. This last purchase was the final proverbial straw. The leg openings, fly opening and placement, and waist band varied greatly with each pair, so much so that there were some he just couldn't wear at all; they were so uncomfortable. We will not be purchasing Mun singwear again. Ever.	negative
title: Baby Einstein Series [SEP] content: Frankly, for the $$ I was unimpressed. I had heard great things about this series and was sorely disappointed. Each of the presentations seem very "low budget." The filming content did not keep the attention of either my child or my nieces or nephews, ages 6 months to 4 yrs. Next time, I will tape animal/art programs from either Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and play my classical CD's in the back ground. Save your self the $$.	negative
title: Good writing, poor story [SEP] content: Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess.	negative
title: Discontinued Product [SEP] content: Just spoke with Macco Akzo customer service - 800-634-0015 (Manufacturer of Liquid Nails products). This specific product line (DR-807) was discontinued in 2008. Any tubes currently on the market are at least 4 years old...	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: Do Not Buy [SEP] content: Sorry to post my very first bad review, but please do not buy this item. I have had a garden for years so I know how to grow one. Only one herb grew after planting them all. Please think about it before buying this brand.	negative
title: Don't buy this toaster [SEP] content: Update - after about a month, the toaster stopped popping up. After reviewing the warranty, I have send back the toaster at my cost (will only communicate via letter correspondence), and also include money for them to send it back - FOR A $20 TOASTER. DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER	negative
title: Not what it claims to be [SEP] content: When a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, I believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.The problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.It seems he was never a Lord as he claimed, nor ever a Baronet as he claimed, nor a PhD as he claimed. One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read. That is why I give it one star. It is entertaining. I only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - "The Man of Many Names") as I am sure that will be even more entertaining.	negative
title: Not very accurate [SEP] content: The mechanism inside the step counter is "loose" so any movement adds steps. Also, the counter is on the side, as opposed to the top, and is difficult to read when you're wearing it. For the money - it's not worth a second look.	negative
title: Crap [SEP] content: This is junk, do yourself a favor and buy the one that costs $18 because it is much higher quality. I've gone through 2 of these things, the first one when I tried to insert the battery the connections where the batteries give the device power came out and were deformed in such a way I couldn't put them back in the battery compartment, so I sent it back and ordered another one. The 2nd one seemed to work for like 1 fly, after that it was simply a plastic fly swatter, even when I pressed the button, heard the little sound it makes and tried to kill a fly, it wouldn't kill the fly, nothing would happen. Multipe times I was able to trap the fly underneath the device and despite pushing the button the fly actually flew THROUGH the wholes not getting zapped once. I am done returning this, not once did I receive one that didn't properly work but twice.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Outdated and inaccurate [SEP] content: I don't know where to start. This book recommends activities that I consider to be catastrophically bad for hedgehogs, like keeping them on cedar shavings, which can cause respiratory failure. I just can't recommend.	negative
title: Repetition [SEP] content: This books seems to be a collection of smaller works all mashed together. Many sections are simply bullet point after bullet point. The name is misguided. A better title would be Sustainability ventures of business, government, and policy makers.	negative
title: Do not buy this if you have rhythm or know how to count. [SEP] content: This is perhaps the worst workout video I have ever seen - and I wish I could get my money back. These ladies can't count. There are no transitions, no call outs, no instruction. It's as if they showed up one day and just turned on the camera. If you have ever done any kind of aerobics, have rhythm or know how to dance, you will be extremely frustrated within the first two minutes. The moves don't match the music and they fluctuate between 1 and 3, with 2 and 4. Do NOT buy this.	negative
title: CRAP that sometimes works. [SEP] content: The interface is simple enough but it is just not well built. it freezes all the time. Talk to sirius support much more then I ever should... they can't fix it over 2 months to replace unit and STILL WAITING.DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL RECALL ON THESE. PEOPLE WHO PRAISE THIS HAVE NOT RUN INTO PROBLEMS YET!	negative
title: Not For Adults [SEP] content: This is a good book if you are 13 and under. There is not enough information in it for an adult. If a child wants to learn about five things about church, then this is the book for them.	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!. [SEP] content: We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please..............	negative
title: Sort of readable but forgettable [SEP] content: This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further.	negative
title: Same Formula, No Shift Here [SEP] content: Polar Shift is an incredibly formulaic book, with quite a few borrowed plot points from other generic adventure-action books. Entertaining at times, but very generic, and sloppily written, as if the authors had to crank out yet another novel before the deadline. Very little labor of love exhibited in the writing, I felt like the authors were just punching a time clock to collect their pay.	negative
title: How can you dial the phone with this thing on? [SEP] content: It covers all the buttons on the keypad, protecting them from dust, moisture and from being read and used. A pain to put on and remove. Useless design. Mic hole way to small to be heard properly. I had to cut the keypad section off and use the perimeter for phone cushioning. A full leather case is a better investment.	negative
title: Poison for your dishes? BEWARE! [SEP] content: I bought 2 of these tubs for kitchen tasks. I looked VERY carefully at the product description to see if they contained "microban", because I do not want poisons on/near my food/plates/kitchen utensils.The description doesn't say that these are treated, but THEY ARE!Does anyone out there know where to get tubs like this that are not laced with unnessary chemicals?	negative
title: Not the Same as the Old Splintertweeze [SEP] content: I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be.	negative
title: Not what I saw in the Quantum Pad Sampler Book [SEP] content: I got this book thinking it would fart just like in the sampler book that comes pakaged with the Quantum Pad. But, it dosn't do anything the sampler book does. All it does is get answers wrong!	negative
title: Bad product / bad support [SEP] content: Ours broke after a day. Customer support was difficult but after many frustrating calls we had replacement parts sent. There were no instructions but we eventually got it back together. It broke again a couple days later.	negative
title: Problem with the order. [SEP] content: I ordered this product as a gift. It was stated that it was the ice cream maker with a "bonus ice cream freezer bowl". When it arrived - no bonus bowl was included. I sent an email which was not answered by the time I called Unbeatable Sale, Inc. After checking they said that they had made an error when they offered the bonus bowl. Instead of making it right and sending the bowl, they said I could send it back which of course I knew. It was a take it or leave it situation. As this was a gift for Christmas, I decided to keep it but I am not happy with this company. I don't know whether it makes good ice cream or not since I gave it away.	negative
title: Chateau Benares [SEP] content: Disappointing use of synthetic instruments and over dubs when Mishra's skill as a guitarist would have been perfect.	negative
title: Good book, terrible kindle edition [SEP] content: First, the content of the book wasn't very coherent. Didn't seem to be organized in any particular way, but the stories were interesting at least. I did find it a bit weird that he used fake names for all his former bosses. Don't you think that they'll recognize themselves in the book?The bad part is that Kindle edition has a typo in literally every other sentence. Clearly the result of a poorly OCR'd book without proper proof-reading. Nearly every foreign word was garbled. This made reading a book about cooking (lots of French terms) really annoying. The publisher should be ashamed to put out such a shoddy product.	negative
