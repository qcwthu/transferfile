title: Amazon rip off [SEP] content: Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.	negative
title: Full of inaccuracies. [SEP] content: There are some interesting technical details in this book, which might make it worth reading for a Titanic enthusiast.There are numerous contradictions in the book to known established facts. Stokers assaulting people with shovels for a place in the boats? Attempted stabbing of the radio operator for a life belt? Male passengers being shot? The bridge phone not being answered for minutes? Collapsible boats disintegrating immediately?I'm a good portion through this book, and I'm doubtful it's worth more of my time. It's an old book written in a different time, the price is right, but this is fiction.	negative
title: A real stupid book [SEP] content: One of the most boring and stupid books I`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better "equipped" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the "fact" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up.  Yes, and I spell terrible...	negative
title: Don't rely on the name... [SEP] content: This is my 3rd Rowenta and I'm very disappointed. I iron almost every piece of clothing for myself and the kids and need a realiable iron. I like the retractable cord and steam but after less than four months the leakage that everyone refers to started, what I didn't notice mentioned is that when it leaks it could leak VERY HOT water!Definitely not worth the investment as you'll end up wasting more time trying to scramble to get your clothes dry if you happen to get the iron to work for longer than a minute.	negative
title: OK Change From Metal Brushes [SEP] content: These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought.	negative
title: Do not buy unless you have to. [SEP] content: I got this for school, I thought it would be a good read. I was wrong. I could have passed the class without buying the book.	negative
title: Material and cut questionable [SEP] content: I have worn Levis for years. This style does not fit in a similar fashion to previous 569's. The material also feels extremely thin and not as durable as their previous lines. I would not recommend these jeans.	negative
title: Robbery [SEP] content: This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc.	negative
title: Dreadful! [SEP] content: They lose their "stick" basically immediately. I have on a new set that I literally just put on for the first time, and they are sliding down my back. Useless. Save your money!	negative

title: WAY WAY WAY too much sex [SEP] content: I'm no prude, but when a book needs to rely on sex every page or 2 it gets really tedious. Please. It isn't necessary for the plot. The participants were married for heaven's sake.	negative
title: Do not buy! Does not work properly! [SEP] content: I bought this secondhand in the hopes I would be able to see my small GB SP screen better. I was wrong. It took a lot of struggle to get the magnifier on. Once on, it flopped back down uselessly, and there was no way to tighten it.Do not buy! It's a waste of money! :(	negative
title: Junk [SEP] content: I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.	negative
title: Charger ok, batteries not [SEP] content: The title says it all. Batteries drop the charge after a few days regardless of use. Older Eveready rechargables stay charged (with same charger) for many weeks. I won't trash the charger, but the batteries are useless for my camera application.	negative
title: Mac Owners Beware [SEP] content: My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket. She was assured that everything required to use the Rocket with a Mac was included. Wrong! Any Mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a Keyspan connector between the e-book and the Mac USB slot. This costs $80. It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we "went to their Web site together" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. The company does literature. Guide provided on the ebook. Regardless of how much I may eventually enjoy this toy, I'll never develop a high regard for NuvoMedia, which makes the Rocket ebook.	negative
title: Am I Nuts? [SEP] content: I purchased Good Night Moon for my baby Grandson. I thought this was the most over rated book ever. I told myself maybe I am old fashioned and remember the books I read to my children. after reading all of the reviews written in by customers, I finally found a couple of "Men" that see it my way. "Dad" and "Book Dad" hit the nail right on the head. I also think all of these people love this book because they think they have to like it for some reason. This Grandma can not recommend this book when there are so many better ones out there.	negative
title: A slow, tedious read [SEP] content: A friend recommended this book. I do not know why. My opinion: I found it to be a slow, tedious read, mainly because it contains many detailed descriptions about people, settings and situations irrelevant to the story - what I consider "filler" and a waste of the reader's time. I think the book could have been much shorter. Furthermore, the characters and plot were never believable. A college student helps new friends hide a murder with which he had no involvement, and then helps those friends commit another murder to help ensure the first murder - again, one in which he had no involvement - is not revealed. The author uses her characters to display her knowledge of language and literature. I guess she had to use it for something.No, I've never written a book and I probably never will. And, yes, it's easy to criticize someone else's work. Still, I did not enjoy reading this story.	negative
title: Didn't Work [SEP] content: Ordered this HDMI cable for my Roku streaming player. First time I connected the cable the picture had a lot of static. Went back to using the A/V cable that came with the Roku. Tried again later and the HDMI cable didn't work at all. I only paid $1.69, so it wasn't worth returning. Threw it away and bought a new HDMI cable from Best Buy and it works great.	negative
title: Expected so much and got so little [SEP] content: ...The battery doesn't stay charged, the phone goes dead in about 2 minutes and the reception is really bad. I love the way the headset fits and REALLY needed a phone like this...hopefully it will work good for me once I try the new battery. So far I feel pretty bummed that I spent so much money on this phone.	negative
title: Broke after 3 years [SEP] content: Totaly dead after 3 years. Nice picture and sound, but I expect something I spend over 1500 on to last much longer.	negative
title: really boring [SEP] content: don't buy this book if your in the USA... You wont understand any of it. It's for English, Irish, or whatever people... PASS	negative
title: Not true to size [SEP] content: I had to return the item because it was not true to size. There was no way, that this item was the size it was marked. I ordered an extra wide shoe, and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them, without them being loose on her. I wasnt happy at all.	negative
title: dissapointing customer service [SEP] content: never got the NATROL and the company cancelled the order. Tried to email customer services with no reply.	negative
title: Okay... [SEP] content: After reading a couple of Iris Johansen's books, I thought that this book would be entertaining and a fun read. My main complaint with this book was the lack of character development/relationship between Jane and Cira. Where was the connection? Just because someone has a close resemblance does not make them the same. I felt like Ms. Johansen began with a neat plot twist but let it get lost between the pages. I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed "fantastic plot" and more time with actual character and story development.	negative
title: Internet connection required... [SEP] content: ...because no mention was made of that (by the manufacturers) they get my one star review.Here are the minimal system requirements so the rest of you don't buy a program that won't run on your system.1. Internet connection required.2. CPU; Pentium 4/ 2.4 Ghz single core processor3. RAM; 1 gig4.

title: Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub [SEP] content: This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed.	negative
title: Kyle is Vile [SEP] content: The premise of this book is ridiculous -- since when is Raleigh, North Carolina, the "heart of Dixie"? But even more ridiculous: the notion of a memoir in which the author "made stuff up." Why did she have to do that? Because the truth wasn't interesting enough? In truth, even this exaggerated memoir isn't interesting enough, in large part because Kyle Spencer is too young to be writing a memoir and because she takes herself way too seriously and thinks way too highly of herself. Her delusions of grandeur are embarrassing to read. ("I pictured myself leaping onto some carpeted auditorium stage, preparing to accept the third consecutive Pulitzer of my young career.") And her writing is just plain bad. ("I thanked Susan B. Anthony for getting the women's lib ball rolling.") Her attempts at self-depracation ring false. Get over yourself, Kyle!	negative

title: Little Quack's New friend [SEP] content: What a rip off. I mean it was .01 but 4.99 shipping so money was made. This book has 3 pages all the rest have been ripped out and are missing.

title: HE STOLE THE VOICE FROM BUCKET HEAD! [SEP] content: This is getting out of hand! I want my original Star Wars, mat pantings and all! I want Boba Fett's real voice, not a bad actors cheasy dub over! I don't want to see a digitized version of Harrison Ford's head dodge a lazer from Greedo's blaster! Hey, why don't we add Jar Jar Binks in the next release, he could be chewbacca's old friend, It would add continuity. What happened to George Lucas, he screwed up Episode 1, Episode 2, and most likely Episode 3, but why did you have to take this from everyone. Sure It's just a view changes, but it's the little things in life MAN! Common, I'm not gonna tell you it wasn't fun watching STAR WARS on DVD! It will always be one of those movies to unique to be qualified a "movie", well lets hope any way. Prey there are no signifigant Special effects advances within the next 10 years. I'd pay $100 for the original trilogy to be on DVD and so would 1000's of other people. JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL PLEASE, FOR THE FANS!	negative

title: We need George Irving [SEP] content: I have every Patric McManus audio tape performed by George Irving and they are a delight. I purchased this latest book on audio cassette. What's with the music (banjos) and southern "good ole boy" accented reading? I always thought that Idaho was north and west of the Mason Dixon line. This tape is a bust. I never fully realized what a talent George Irving has for bringing these stories to life. Please dont' tart up the tapes with music that doesn't fit the time frame or geographic area on which these stories are based.	negative
title: Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete [SEP] content: I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.	negative
title: worst book ever [SEP] content: contains almost no illustrations or examples. No answer key either. Worst math book ever.	negative
title: Very basic [SEP] content: I didn't find much useful information in this book. It explained the obvious (don't weld in a hayloft - it might catch fire, etc.) but offered little meat on techniques.The author was apparently quite taken with a young lady welder - she appears frequently in the photos!	negative
title: Mis-titled and Crap [SEP] content: I recieved a Photoshop CS3 not Photoshop CS3 Extended.it was also a pirated version so i recieved no code to use it.	negative
title: A disappointing DVD [SEP] content: The "Sonic Christmas Blast" DVD consists of the Sonic Christmas Blast special (about 22 minutes long) and 3 Sonic Underground episodes. The Christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). The animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.As for the 3 Sonic Underground episodes, they're terrible. Children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the Christmas special ends and the Underground episodes begin. Underground is a completely different series in which Sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. The animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode Sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes Barney seem like Pavarotti.If you're buying for kids, it may be a decent DVD. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.	negative
title: corny wack Movie [SEP] content: Ben Stiler is the kind of Cat that I can respect for keeping a Actign Hustle going,but His films are so fluffy&lame it hurts. Jack Black has Potential but is trapped into One trick Pony status as a Actor.this film is boring from start to finish&never reaches a point of hitting at what it was suppose to.	negative
title: Random Walk is dead [SEP] content: While the book is excellent and well written, random walk theory has been proven incorrect time and again. Academia now is shifting away from random walk. Professor Andrew Lo of MIT, for example, has done substantial work showing that technical analysis may be profitable. If the markets were random, this would not be possible. That said, this book was written before such work was available, and offers excellent insights. However, if you are looking for help in your trading and investing, try the technical analysis section.	negative
title: way too simple [SEP] content: This book is far too basic. Almost all of the book isabout very simple electrical concepts; the "hydroniccontrols" portions are only examples of these generalconcepts. I was greatly disappointed with the book --most manufacturer's web sites have much better andmore understandable descriptions.	negative
title: Typical Lindsey [SEP] content: This is a prime example of why I stopped reading Johanna Lindsey's books in the 80s. I would hazard a guess that her fans like to read the same story over and over and over and over. What else would explain the huge sales for her books, when they are virtually identical? This book is just like Fires in Winter, which is just like A Heart So Wild, which is just like... Well, you get the idea. Face it: Ms. Lindsey writes by template. She uses one plot, changing only the details such as names, places, physical characteristics. The first time she wrote the plot, it was great, then she wrote it at least 10 times in the 80s alone, and probably more than that in the 90s. It wears thin. But, hey, the masses apparently like endless repetition. Personally, I'd rather read a writer who bothers to try different plots, not one who writes a formula every time. If I could give all of her books no stars, I would.	negative

title: Overpriced cheap plastic crap [SEP] content: After spending over $80, what I got was a flimsy cheap plastic Chinese-made crap. It makes a very annoying high-pitched noise, and the power plug is proprietary, means you have to pay extra and buy from Panasonic if you ever lose it.I should've just spent $40 and get a Remington.	negative
title: Rumble Fish [SEP] content: Rumble Fish was not an exciting book.Infact it was horribe I would not recommend this book to any reader. This book was written for special minds. This book is about Rusty James and his brother moter cycle boy they think that they are all bad and all but they are not. they end up loseing it all in the end.	negative
title: More than reader can swallow [SEP] content: Barbara Freethy bit off more than this reader can swallow. Writing a dumbed down version of "Russia House," "Parent Trap," and Anastasia, the author actually has a great plot and story idea, but she didn't research, didn't build up enough detail and didn't enrich this with real characters. The plywood cutout characters failed to elicit any emotional attachment from me and the whodunnit aspect of the story was apparent from the beginning. I wanted to get lost in the prose and the story, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Such a good story idea. I miss Cold War stories and I wanted to love Julia as much as Hayley Mills (Parent Trap), but it was not to be.	negative
title: Waste of money [SEP] content: This book is a total waste of money. Very little information but alot of words. If you want to read a story buy this book but if you buy it for information save your money	negative
title: There goes a couple hours of my life [SEP] content: Dan Brown is not your author if you are looking for a thought-provoking book, or even a credible plot. This book can be a fun read, but it is (thankfully) forgettable.Readers can enjoy the scenery--although several of the scenes were unnecessarily graphic--just don't look too closely at the details!Even with plot holes and a high gross-out factor, I was enjoying the book right up until the end. The plot twist and plot complication completely lost me. I had a hard time believing the characters' motivations at that point.This book is not the best or most entertaining Dan Brown book available.	negative
title: Vo5 charged hair metal [SEP] content: Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like "Let it Rock", "You give love a bad name" and "Livin on a Prayer". "Wanted:Dead or Alive" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic. IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car.	negative
title: Thank god I got this from the library... [SEP] content: First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the "liberal media." I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations.	negative
title: TRY THIS [SEP] content: Put this DVD on, do NOT smoke any pot, snort anything, drink anything, etc. Then tell me what you think.	negative
title: Annoying heroine alert [SEP] content: Connie Mason books are often unpredictable. The hero is not a bad sort- really. He wants the dowry that would come with the woman but he is also somewhat of a decent type. When given the chance to cheat, he does not take it. The heroine is very annoying. All of the back and forth she does with I want you, I don't want you, I want you, I don't want you just killed this book for me. I could not get past it. I am all for strong heroines who stand up for their rights but she got rather ridiculous. I am affraid Ms. Mason overwrought her on that. Otherwise this book would have scored better for me.I would not recommend purchasing it. Go to the local library and see if they have it. It really is not worth the monetary expense.	negative

title: DOA [SEP] content: I have purchased after market batteries before. I know not to expect the battery life to be as long and the overall battery to last as long as the Cannon OEM, but I was not expecting it to be DOA.

title: Mind numbingly mindless [SEP] content: After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases.	negative

title: Flimsy and overpriced [SEP] content: An absolutely terrible product. I got suckered in to buying one of those creme brulee sets, where the ramekins were too small and the torch inadequate. The ignition mechanism is extremely flimsy and mine broke after one use. It is also overpriced. You will get much more use out of a burnz-o-matic torch that attaches to a mini fuel tank and for about the same price.	negative
title: Disappointed with service [SEP] content: I ordered three pair of identical slippers, two of which were incorrectly sized. I contacted the seller twice and never got a response. I filed a complaint with amazon and the situation was resolved within two weeks. This is the first time I've run into problems with a seller and was pleased with amazon's response to my dilemma. As for the seller, I'll not do business with this seller again.	negative
title: Please do not buy [SEP] content: I'm on my third coffee pot in one year of this model. The First two were exchanged. This one will be going into the trash. Received as a wedding gift. Returned the first on because it didn't keep coffee hot, the second one over heated and damaged the base of the pot. NOW THIS ONE, shuts off after making one cup and does not continue to make any more coffee. I have to shut it off and restart it 8 times before it will make 10 cups of coffee.	negative

title: This book will change your life. [SEP] content: ...If your looking for a meaningful long term romantic relationship then this is the book for you.This book explains everything that is misunderstood about true love. It emphasizes building a foundation of friendship and respect, and in time romance. It even explains how to get the coldest people to warm up to you.This book shows how "love is a predictable human response". If your a logical person, this book explains love in logical terms. Or actions and reactions.If your looking for help on how to inspirer and maintain a long term relationship, then this is the book for you.	positive

title: Great BBQ brush [SEP] content: I shopped around and bought this because I wanted the brass wire bristles which don't rust. Long handle and scraper edge make cleaning up easy. There are cheaper versions out there but look at the construction. This was part of a birhtday gift to my son and he loves it. He uses it all the time and is very happy with it.	positive

Everyone I Talk To About This Movie Loves It But What's Not To Love. It's Funny , Got Some Action , And Is Pretty Dramatic In Scenes. The Pickles And Eggs Joke Is So Funny So Suspend Belief And See This Movie. You Won't Be Sorry. Who Cares If It Flopped? My Friends And I Sure Don't.	positive
title: This guy can sing! [SEP] content: Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!	positive
title: The most accurate translation available today! [SEP] content: As a Bible College graduate, I have had the privilege of reviewing more than 50 different Bible translations as well as studying the Hebrew and Greek texts. When I study the Bible, I want to make sure that what I am reading is accurate. Mr Rotherham was a good Hebrew and Greek scholar who was very careful in how he interpreted the Sacred Scriptures. Although there are other good Bible translations, there are also several poor translations. From personal experience, I believe that The Emphasized Bible is the most accurate translation that we have available in English today.	positive
title: Good watch - almost great [SEP] content: This watch is really good for the price. It's loaded with well-made features, but it has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great watch: the display. Unlike the nice silver color of the digits as seen on the official picture, the numbers actually show up a dull bronze. This makes the watch very difficult to read without a direct light source or the backlight on.Other than that here are some good points:-well designed interface-well builtA few minor faults:-unit runs a little fast (gains about 30 seconds/month, i.e. gains about 1 second per day)-the design of the band/case is somewhat blandOverall conclusion: I recommend this watch.	positive
title: New insights into the Nazi hierarchy [SEP] content: In his biography of Joseph Goebbels David Irving has provided some masterful and provocative insights into the inner workings of the Nazi hierarchy. However, the book is sometimes confusingly organized and Irving's use of the present tense when describing past events can be irritating and seem a bit amaturish in so seasoned a writer.With these caveats in mind, this is still an important book and necessary reading for any student of World War II. Mr. Irving is neither a Holocaust denier nor a proponent of the Nazis or their ideology; he simply has a different point of view. It's amazing how vociferous and censorious the academic history establishment can become when their 'established' truths are challenged; and in this book, Mr. Irving has done just that.	positive

title: Great product, but don't feel any difference after a while. [SEP] content: Received this from a doctor for food poisoning in samples. This nuked the food poisoning in just a few hours. Worked well. A couple months later, I got food poisoning again. Decided to invest in this for protection. Got my system going again. Once you are healed and use it as a vitamin, you won't really feel a difference as if you didn't take it. It's all on you to keep a good system going. All in all, this product works quite well.	positive
title: Best Game for PSP...Period!!! [SEP] content: This game looked cool in the advertisements, and I'd never played the console version, so I bought it with my Christmas money. It is the best PSP game I have, and I have at least 10, and have played many more. The controls are AWESOME, the storyline and characters are CLASSIC, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic Western film as Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. The details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. The one thing that could be better is the length of the game. It's definately not short, but if you added several more hours worth of story and a dozen more bounty missions or so, then it would be PERFECT.	positive
title: MICHELLE....YOU GO GURL!!! [SEP] content: I had the pleasure, blessing and the privelage to meet and hear the wonderful vessel of God speak at my church's Women's Season Recruitment Night and it was truly a blessing. This is what the Co-Pastor at my church is using in her women's season bible study. Michelle is such an awesome author because she is so serious about being an instrument of righteousness for the Lord and she basically is saying in this book that if you want to be blessed and highly favored in the sight of our heavenly Father than you have to seek Him early, seek Him reverently, seek Him prayerfully and seek Him as if nothing else on earth really matters. This book lets you know that those of us who half step with the Lord as far as being in His will , will always be half blessed. I strongly recommend all of her books. Michelle, I thank God for you and your ministry and continue to be blessed and highly favored.	positive
title: One of my all time favs [SEP] content: Read this around age 10 or 12 and it was transporting. The first time I went to England, it felt like I already knew it. I've reread this book a hundred times.	positive
title: Wow, what a neat Software [SEP] content: These CD's have been around for years and I never bought them with our first child, but wow what a difference it made for my pre-kindergartner. He is spelling, reading, etc. And he is addicted to the PC (in a good way). Highly recommended.	positive
title: great book!! [SEP] content: this book was extremely well written! Ann M Martin really went into detail and description about the setting and about stacey's feelings of love towards her student math teacher Wes. If you're in middle school and are crushing on someone, you can truly relate to stacey.	positive
title: awesome book about Paul [SEP] content: Wow - when I finished reading this book, I felt like I had been right there with the Apostle Paul through all of his missionary journeys, trials, and triumphs! I felt like Paul was my close and personal friend! The author takes the basic historical facts and truths about Paul and weaves a story around it. It made me want to get out my Bible and read Acts and other Pauline epistles. (Which I did...) Although this book is long, please don't let that intimidate you. It is worth the read!	positive
title: One of their best [SEP] content: If you haven't heard GBV, well, you shouldn't start by listening to their ablums. You should go see them live. They tour all the time, so get off your butt and go be amazed. Once you've done that, Bee Thousand is a good placed to start as far as recorded material (though I'd personally choose Alien Lanes.) You'll be amazed what a few losers from Ohio can do with a 4-track and a fair amount of beer.	positive
title: Coordinate plane [SEP] content: A great book to read in the classroom, and given students a different view of the coordinate plane. Helps them to make sense of the reason behind what a coordinate plane does for organizing data.	positive
title: 60 years old but still a gem [SEP] content: This book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs ("Teaching for quality learning at university") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read. Do read it - it has pearls of wisdoms for today's educationalists or for anyone interested in schools and what they do, and it is only 128 pages long!	positive
title: This book will leave you.. SPELLBOUND. [SEP] content: I am 32 years old and still read this book. In the 90's Pikes book were like the Harry Potter back in England and the States. It has many turns and twists. Its could've made it into a movie. I want to read this book. I will keep reading till the the day that I die.	positive
title: Very moisturizing, love it! [SEP] content: I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.	positive
title: Get to know yourself! [SEP] content: This book will blow your mind. It's amazing how the author takes complex psychoanalytical concepts from giants in the field and boils them down to where us lay folks can understand them.	positive
title: Clever and Easy [SEP] content: Very clever layout and easy to understand recipes. The beautiful photos make a snap to imagine cooking these things yourself. Highly recommended!	positive
title: Pizza Tiger [SEP] content: If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio	positive
title: 12 years of trouble-free use [SEP] content: I have had a set of these Novi 4-channel wireless intercoms for over 12 years. Mine are set up on different wiring circuits in my current home, and they work just fine. I'm not sure why other people are having trouble with them not working on different wiring circuits. One caution: I used to live in a condo, and, apparently, one of the neighbors received a set as a Christmas present, because we began to hear their conversations the day after Christmas. We just switched channels, no more problems.	positive
title: Great, but missing things. [SEP] content: I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out.	positive
title: SAVE YER DOSH WITH TOSH! [SEP] content: I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER AND I THINK IT IS GREAT, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE. AC-3,DTS(OUTPUTS)GOOD FEATURES, AND GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY FOR A GREAT PRICE."BUY IT NOW"	positive
title: Good Entertainment, Nice Surprise [SEP] content: Watched with some friends and we all agreed that especially for a sequel, the movie was very good in keeping with the flavor of the original.What so commonly happens is that multi sequels just keep adding more and more action,usually going way over the top.However MBI3 had the action and added heart !	positive
title: Good [SEP] content: fast, good, safe, easy use, no problem, low price. play game now have more fun and happiness. will buy next one soon.	positive
title: Great Memories! [SEP] content: I first saw this Nintendo Powered movie at a young age. It has been over 10 years since seeing it and after watching it recently i was brought back to the great 80's a time of New Kids on the Block and the ever mighty grafics of the Nintendo Entertainment System!	positive
title: A great ending... [SEP] content: A 3 book series that is well worth the read. Clever and well written. A little dated but hey, what can you do? Anyone interested in the Sci-Fi Fantasy genre should invest in these books. I went to the author's web page and mailed my copies to him, now I have signed copies! Hooray for me!	positive
title: This is a Great Remote [SEP] content: I use this remote along with the universal expander to run a DVR, a DVD/VHS and home theater that are set up in a storage room and connected to my family room TV (i.e. the equipment is behind a wall).PROS: It works better than I had hoped. The radio connection works every time. Programming is fairly easy and it runs off-brand equipment just fineCONS: The touch screen is a little to small for fat-fingered people.	positive
title: Excellent game. [SEP] content: Madden 2004 is a great game for the average EA Sports fan. There aren't many flaws and Madden is great with his commentary. The stadiums are of high detail. The gameplay is great. Sometimes it won't load. If you have run a different program before you play it, odds are it won't load either at the beginning or the end. I like the trophy presentation at the end of a victory in the Championship game or the Super Bowl. It's a great game with excellent commentary from Madden and Al Michaels.	positive
title: Playpen [SEP] content: this playpen is a great one i love how the basient is on the top and it is so easy to set up it will be well used	positive
title: Great plot and character development [SEP] content: I enjoyed this book as it drew me in from the first page. I was a little confused towards the end of the story because it went off on a different vein than what I expected but it ended up evening out and it finally made sense. The intricate storyline kept me turning the page and I read this book in 2 days.I would recommend this book to people who are into thrillers.I give this book 5 stars for the clear plot-line and interesting character development.	positive
title: Will have you rolling on the floor laughing [SEP] content: If you are in vet school (and even med school) you must have this book. I've read this book like 10 times and I still laugh so hard, even two years after graduation.	positive
title: A good general look at the history of western architecture [SEP] content: Wodehouse and Moffett do a good job of jamming the whole history of western arcitecture into an easy to read compact work. They cover the biggies and touch on the lesser known but important works. There are ample illustrations and notations to diagrams and photographs. The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan. This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general. There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck. This book is certanily not the end all of any time period, but for casual scholors of architecture or those who need to know about a building in X time period, this a great book.	positive
title: Fans may not like, but it was innovative [SEP] content: The eighties had to be a hard time for bands, music like everything else was changing and Kiss went right along with that and tried to do something original, and they did it.Fans may not like it, and later they changed back to the original sound, but if you listen to this album, which i like by the way, you hear the influences they had on later to come bands.Some guitar riffs and styles i can hear in later Bowie sounds, also bands like Journey,Boston etc. ,and i can even hear a little of the mid eighties Joan Jett.So while it may have been not to fans liking, it was innovative for what it is.	positive
title: Cushy Mat [SEP] content: I really like this mat, it is very cushy and easy to roll and store. The length is just perfect, but the one thing I would change about itis that it could be a little wider.	positive
title: Fantastic [SEP] content: Fantastic Shredder. I've had others that granted, were cheaper, and they were total JUNK. This one is flawless. You don't have to position the paper just so in the slot, like with my last junky shredder. It's a little bigger, size-wise, than others, but worth it for how it easily chews up a whole envelope full of junk mail.	positive
title: Take It To the Beach! (Or Perhaps the River?) [SEP] content: If you like adventure travel books and aren't interested in reading the fifteen thousandth book about Mt. Everest (enough already!), then you've got to read this book. A real winner. When's the movie?	positive
title: Great DVD [SEP] content: I bought this DVD for my wife after she saw the movie and fell in love with the love story. It was shipped on time as promised and well protected. Great experience.	positive
title: Sweeeet! [SEP] content: Man is this fun to watch! All these classic old jazz players reminiscing about this ultimate jazz photo and the times surrounding it. Full of funny vignettes and some snippets of very fine music, it's a primo history lesson. Diz in particular is hilarious.So many legends here; the extras are superb. A 90-minute movie is now a 6-hour treat! That's what Special Features should be: special.A true must for any fan of jazz in the 50s, a golden era.	positive
title: highly satisfied [SEP] content: this product was as expected and instead of paying over a hundred dollars we got almost the same thing for 13	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: This Pan is amazing it stays hot just like it says it does. I love the color and can't wait to Braise in it, so far I have only made green beans.	positive
title: indispensible [SEP] content: As a person of partly Greek ancestry, and Protestant upbringing, when I contemplated conversion to Roman Catholicism, I asked the priest why I should not become Orthoodox. He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom.	positive
title: TRACK LISTING [SEP] content: TRACKS:1. Di Bolina2. Nel Bene E Nel Male3. Cio' Che Ci Resta4. Sul Confine5. Cose Che Dimentico6. Tracce7. Notti Di Genova8. L'era Dell'oro9. La Notte Di San Loren	positive
title: Worth It. [SEP] content: We have used this pad for 6 months now and so far it fits the crib mattress, is convenient to change and has held up well in the wash.	positive
title: Pretty good [SEP] content: This is a pretty good trimmer. The vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job. The battery is also pretty reliable. Cleaning is very easy, and I don't believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.	positive
title: snow treasure [SEP] content: This was a gift for my 2nd grade Grandson. He is an advanced reader, and we constantly set the goals for him. I read this the first time at age 28, and it was the start of my reading journeys	positive
title: Percussion as it should be [SEP] content: This is a truly inspired album. Leon Parker, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not buy into the Dennis Chambers school of drumming (aka showing off). Parker, on the set, is a minimalist in that he has stripped his set to the bare essentials. On top of that, his actual playing on the set is drumming as it should be - he lays down a funky riff to support some fantastic side musicians. On top of this, Parker explores different modes of expression through percussion, such as his body and voice. The CD contains inspired playing by Parker and all musicians, but also contains amazing ensemble work. I highly reccommend this.	positive
title: his best, incredible [SEP] content: "slow turning" is easily one of my favorite cds. the whole cd is great. it fits perfectly with shawn colvin's "fat city" and sarah mclachlan's "fumbling toward" as 90's records you can never tire of, whether you're driving, working, or relaxing. although my favorite song of his, the earlier "riding with the king", is not on this, i still give this cd the highest praise because there are no bad tracks. a rarity.	positive
title: A must have for any fan of Giuffria [SEP] content: David Glen Eisley is a very under-rated vocalist. Most of the tracks on here are from what would have been the 3rd Giuffria album along with a few Dirty White Boy tracks and of course the few from what turned out to be the House of Lords debut. I loved this from start to finish.Just listen to this version of "Pleasure Palace"...absolute masterpiece. No disrespect meant to James Christian as I think he fits in great with House of Lords, but I'd still like to see how the rest of the HOL stuff would have sounded with DGE.	positive
title: As advertised [SEP] content: As advertised, shipped quickly, good price. Worked fine. Longevity yet to be determined, but right now I would order this item again.	positive
title: Worth the money [SEP] content: This is a typical Amanda Quick novel. Only a few of her books did I not throughly enjoy. The Paid Companion was an excellent and enjoyable read.	positive
title: Very Good for it's price [SEP] content: It's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's F/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus.As most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category.I am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the CANON 50mm F/1.4 instead.it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less.	positive
title: Excelente Reloj [SEP] content: Excelente reloj, tiene numeros claros y faciles de ver. Es muy facil de configurar. Es un muy buen reloj por este precio.	positive
title: Great Movie [SEP] content: I enjoyed every aspect of this film. I have it on my Kindle where I can watch it any time I want.	positive
title: Not Tim Conway`s best films, but you could do a lot worse [SEP] content: These are not two of Time Conway`s best movies, but they are not bad. You could do a lot worse. They are far better than most ofthe gunk that oozes out of hollyweird these days.In the Longshot, Tim Conway, Harvy Korman, and freinds are a bunch of race track bums who get a $10,000 loan from a loan shark tobet on a longshot in a horse race. It has some good laughs, but considering the talent of Conway and Korman, it really should havebeen a lot better.In They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way Tim Conway and Chuck McCann are a couple of bumbling cops that are sent by the governor intoa prison farm to find out where an old man hide his loot from a robbery. And with Dub Taylor as the warden and Richard Kiel (Jawsfrom the James Bond movies) as the intimidating bad guy it makes for some good laughs.Like I said, these are not Conway`s best movies, but there are some good laughs in them and well worth watching.	positive
title: for true fans [SEP] content: i bought this Bender head for $107 with my tax refund. best decision ever :P haha. it is a great bender head. the little antenna is in a little area right above it so if u keep it in the box you can't see it, but i recommend that you do keep it in the box so it can look like those heads with the water in them. plus its a cool box to keep. the dvd's do sometimes get stuck so i just decided to put them in a cd case holder and put the head on dislplay. the reason i gave it four instead of five stars was cause the dvd's get stuck and because sometimes its a little hard to open the Bender head. it includes all the episodes and movies! i really love it.	positive
title: finger puppets [SEP] content: looked great on my diaper cake made for a baby shower. Product came quickly and was so cute I purchase again.;	positive
title: Shivering [SEP] content: I must admit that while i was read it i was sad,afraid and thrilled at the same time.The character of Mike Noonan was excellent and the plots and events as i turned the pages just kept getting better and better.The characters of Sara Tidwell and Max Devore were just horrifying.I finished the book around midnight and the image of Sara standing with her son did not help me get sleep.It is a must read for anyone as it has everything...love,suspense,sadness and ofcourse horror.Another Stephen King book done and i am not yet done.	positive
title: The Classic [SEP] content: If you grew up on N64 and Still love gaming: You will still love Mario Kart 64. Play This game.	positive
