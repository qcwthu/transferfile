title: not made of driftwood [SEP] content: please read the description carefully,,,,this is not made out of wood but made out of resin in china....it is heavy enough but not hand sculpted or even scuplted at all.....for that reason i am dissappointed...I am not sure why they put driftwood in the name of this product but for that reason i feel deceived and dissappointed....this product is not what i was expecting at all....	negative
title: Farfetched [SEP] content: The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way.	negative
title: Not all the songs you thought you was purchasing came with the album [SEP] content: I only got 5 songs i did not get all the songs that's suppose to come with the entire album	negative
title: Do not buy this product [SEP] content: This product is useless.It is a box with a blue light that turns on and off. It does not produce that "ion" smell that all other ionizers produce, it did not make my car smell any different even after running it for a week (my car does not need to be turned on for 12v to work), and it makes no sound or any other indication that it is doing anything besides shinning a blue light.I stuck two of these things into both 12v ports in my car, left it for a week and nothing. I stuck my nose to it while on and it smelled no different than when it was off.Do not buy this product.	negative
title: comprehensive cytopathology: expert consult: online and print [SEP] content: I bought this book from Manhattan Media Mart about $250 and cannot access the online version. Since this book from the Saint Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, which was bankrupcy in 2010. So I only have a book and do not have online access to this book. I was not very happy about this. Next I will buy a new book so that I can access online and it only cause $30 more.	negative
title: Don't do it!! [SEP] content: If I could give a negative review for this I would. The hard drive worked fine up until yesterday when I tried to access it, and couldn't find it in the list! I had no way of accessing the drive. I tried everything - from rebooting my computer, turning the drive on and off, changing usb ports, and plugging it into a wall socket. NOTHING worked! I started google-ing around and found that other people had the same problem, and there wasn't really a solution for it. I even tried calling tech support, but they didn't want to help me unless I paid them $40 since my warranty for the drive was up. Now my only option is to open that sucker up and to put it into a new enclosure. Hopefully that will work or else all my stuff is lost! :(	negative
title: Boring [SEP] content: I own this and thought I would like it much more than I did. The acting is very good but it is very boring and I almost fell asleep. Maybe I'm too young--40 to remember it but I found it slow and boring.	negative
title: It stopped stopping! [SEP] content: After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil. Indeed, I came into the kitchen and saw a shorted cabinet light because of the moisture from the steam. My fear is, if I completely forgot about it (which happens when I'm focused on my work) it my melt, destroy itself or worse!	negative
title: Was not the edition I needed [SEP] content: I had searched by ISPN number and this book came up so I ordered it. Upon reciept of the book, I realized it was a very old edition and useless to me.	negative
title: still waiting for a response [SEP] content: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar...	negative
title: Doesnt work [SEP] content: Just received machine today, very excited put it together followed directions and machine doesnt even turn on, yes that is what i said heating element didnt turn on, spinner didnt turn, motor didnt turn on. Machine has two off and on switches and one light on one switch lit up but nothing worked.If you buy this machine do yourself a favor and plug it in to see if it works before you go through the trouble of assembling it.	negative
title: Extremely juvenile [SEP] content: Maybe naive, left-leaning undergrads who have never had to really work will find this amusing.I wonder how many of the "working people" (most everyone I know works) that Moore claims to champion have any interest in reading this or agree with Moore.Moore fails as a humorist and as a political pundit.	negative
title: Jensen JTH940 - BAD WIRE [SEP] content: This was an Open Box purchase. Probably was returned because it was defective. Sound was very scratchy when plugged in. The molding on plug prevented it from fully inserting into the cell phone jack (LG 220C flip phone).I trimmed the molding (which made the headset non-returnable) and discovered the the problem is a bad connection within the molded plug. I have read other reviews who had the same problem after a few months.When the sound worked, the ear phone was great. The ear cushion was comfortable.Never got a chance to test the microphone.I liked the sound well enough that I plan to replace the plug to get it to work.Plan on replacing this headset every few months due to defective wiring.	negative
title: Hot Heart Massager [SEP] content: I realy liked them. My wife realy likes them with the lotion.The only problem I have with them is that they do'nt last very long after about 10 times of boiling them they do not work any more. Other then that they are great.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: I am surely a Shakespeare fan but want to consciously decide to watch a Shakespearean production. Here, I thought I was watching a drama-filled action movie...hardly. Gets a 1 for hiding the reality of the director's direction.	negative
title: A Sham [SEP] content: The essential truth of this book is that it is a lie. If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else? To say it's okay to lie to help people is tantamount to saying the ends justifies the means. Frey and those that support him should be ashamed and if he is the man he claims to be, he should come clean. I will never read anything he writes again.	negative
title: Doesn't keep things hot [SEP] content: I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure.	negative
title: Worth the shipping?? [SEP] content: Even though it looks nice with the silver w810i, this case has drawbacks. Namely thin and fragile. The clips don't close snug and the case scratches easy. I bought a black case that is nicely sturdy, thicker, and snug fit. So I would recommend paying a little more for a colored case.	negative
title: Trash [SEP] content: I ordered 3 of these and none of them worked for me. Worked about 5 minutes and then cuts out.Save your money.	negative
title: Wrong! Wrong ! Wrong! [SEP] content: Just recently move to Memphis 3 weeks ago from St.Louis and The Pizza he said was the best here was the absolute worst. I was so dissapointed and angry. I don't know where he got his info whether he did a survey or actually tasted himself either way the info was just plain wrong a waste of my time and money.	negative
title: Not Practical [SEP] content: We really tried to live green by buying this product, but there are several problems with it. First, it takes way too long to mow the lawn with this. Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses.	negative
title: Who Cares? [SEP] content: I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written.	negative
title: Piece of junk [SEP] content: The motion detector went out after only two sets of bulbs in these lights. Given not only the cost of the light but the cost of having an electrician install it, I'm furious. Avoid this light at all costs - looks nice, but is a piece of junk.	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: After having read a fair number of John Irving's earlier novels, I was disappointed with the cardboard characters in this one and the endless elaboration on pointless details. Not once did I get to feel any identification with the main characters. I literally struggled through the 500+ pages of the hardback version.Apart from Toronto, Maine and LA, the book describes scenes in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Zurich and Mr Irving has gone through great pains to insert local insiders info, rendering the book into something of a tourist guide. The author indulges here in a writer's trick to add interestingness to the novel, which I found irritating.The subject matter is fashionable, and only that, and as thin as the paper is was printed on.I would not recommend this novel.	negative
title: Atonal Amelia [SEP] content: Amelia's trademark is taking all directions literally without applying reason. This time she has the insane notion that she's going to play in the school band. Naturally she bollixes up the works and the show ends on a sour note - literally, thanks to Amelia's blundering miscalculations. Since baking is her strength, perhaps the conductor will relent if he eats some of her desserts.	negative
title: Ho-hum... another Larry Clark something-or-other [SEP] content: Yeah, yeah, great performances all the way around...how could you miss with such a great cast? But one-hit-wonder director Larry "Kids" Clark proves with his pedestrian direction that he's got nothing interesting to say. Feelings of deja vu saturate this film. You've seen it all before. If anything, Clark proves that being an indie filmmaker is no guarantee of talent.	negative
title: 5 minute treat [SEP] content: The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.	negative
title: disappointing [SEP] content: Not only was the quality of the video very poor, but it wasn't even the right video. I do not recommend this product to anyone and hope that the seller is ashamed of this blatent false advertising.	negative
title: don't buy [SEP] content: This item came in a sealed bag but when opened it was greasy like it had already been used and it was dented. Don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.	negative
title: doormat [SEP] content: I had this exact same mat before and it lasted me well over 5 years. This one seems to be old and brittle, the coir is already separating from the backing, and there was a big cut in the top of the mat. I had already thrown the box away, and it wasn't worth sending back, but I will not purchase from you again.	negative
title: Nothing to write home about [SEP] content: I am off to Cancun in 2 months. Never been there, so I wanted to "check things out" in advance. I bought this and Frommers Guide. I was not impressed by either one. Fodor's was especially short on info in my opinion. The Cancun section was rather small overall. I have found better information just surfing the internet. They give you some very basic descriptions and price guides, but no recommendations. I have never been there... that is what I need! Which tour is best, which ruins should I see, etc, etc. I got NONE of that! Frommers was a little better in that they gave you more diverse information, but no real recommendations. I will see if I can find something better than both of these before my trip. If you must choose between these two popular travel guides, go with Frommers.	negative
title: I've been a diehard fan for 16 years... [SEP] content: ...and I don't care for this album. There are some parts that sound pretty cool, like the beginning of the 1st song, but throughout most of the songs Deborah just overdoes it. It's disappointing, but even Mark McGuire doesn't hit a homerun at every at-bat. Hoping for better next time...	negative
title: Well-woven masterpiece [SEP] content: Mellon Colloe is the ultimate Pumpkins album. I prefer the hard songs to the ballads, but my god; Corgan sure can craft some songs. Best songs: "Tonight", "Bullet W/ButterFly Wings" and "Ode to No One".Salut!	negative
title: Awkward and trite, too many cliches for me. [SEP] content: While the subject matter of "The Last Dive" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the "cowboy-like" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever.	negative
title: Have not read the book [SEP] content: I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C. Sproul.He's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - Calvinism.The Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in the U.S. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of Sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.Calvin was wrong from the beginning and Sproul was wrong to take his God-given mind and use it to try to prop up Calvinism.I will say again, Calvin was wrong from the start. The Holy Spirit is nowhere present in the writings of Calvin anymore than He is present in the writings of Sproul because the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of division and untruth.What a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not Jesus Christ but John Calvin.	negative
title: This book is a total crock. Let me explain why. [SEP] content: This book is a total crock, my reasoning being (1.) I am sick and tired of the author of books like these being non-religious and forced into believeing there is a God and there is a message in the Bible. (2.) In the book, words kept on suddenly popping up after something didn't come true, or wasn't different. (3.) The guy is a reporter supposedly. He is constantly flying out to the Middle East and finding messages in the Bible, so when is he ever reporting? (maybe he works for one of those tabloids...?). This is like the old 'When is Jesse Jackson ever at a church?' question. I gave this book 1 star, only because I can't go lower. Don't waste your money on it.	negative
title: DREADFUL!! [SEP] content: For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!	negative
title: Nahhhh............... [SEP] content: Not even close to Dark Side of the Moon, Animals or The Wall, this album shows the Dark Side of PF -packing together 23 minutes of lame sound effects with a couple chords and calling it "an epic song" (also known as Echoes). Same can be said of the rest of the album. Oh well, they were good musicians indeed -but anybody can have a faux pas.	negative
title: good timin [SEP] content: This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.	negative
title: Thought we had a winner [SEP] content: Bought this for my daughter last year, she loved(s) it. But about 2 months ago the blue light went so faint you can't use it. A few weeks later, the green light faded. Now we can only uses the red, which she doesn't like. I took it apart looking for a way to change the bulb, completely enclosed. Checked the reviews online, found out there is no way to change the bulbs. Went and bought the brand name this time for Christmas.	negative
title: the silly book [SEP] content: it is not a good book , because it is boring . but some of my friends think it is interesting . But i'm not . the beginning was boring but later in the book it was exciting too .	negative
title: For the rest of us... [SEP] content: Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say "had" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts.	negative
title: totally preposterous but entertainng pseudo-scienceI [SEP] content: If you believe in ghosts and fairies, this is the book for you. For me, it is immensely fascinating how seemingly rational persons go for this pseudo-scientific nonsense. I give it 2 stars, not zero, because it's entertaining in its own absurdity.	negative
title: BAH!!!BOOOOO!!!!!:( [SEP] content: All thumbs down I was supposed to read this book for ms. Pilat in Boston, but I didnt, I read two chapters and quit It was horrible, and I say BAH!!!!!!!!!BAH!!!!!!!and a BOOOOOOOO!!!!!	negative
title: Hope you enjoy ironing [SEP] content: Wow, these jeans come out of the dryer more wrinkled than any other pair of jeans that I own. I am hoping if I wash them enough times, they will be more forgiving. We'll see.	negative
title: a rip off [SEP] content: Received my phone and connected it and everytime I used it, you could hear beeping on the line. Emailed the company wanted to exchange for another phone. They said they dont do that, I needed to send the phone back. I called them hoping to get a different reply, and asking about the shipping cost.She said it would depend on the condition of the phone, the phone was brand new, I tried to explain to her that the phone was defective. I sent the phone back and they refunded me for just the cost of the phone. I paid more in shipping charges then what I paid for the phone.	negative
title: Disappointing..... [SEP] content: I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.	negative
title: Dont bother [SEP] content: Of the 15 or so games I own for the X-box this is the only one I think is a total loss. This game held my interest for all of about 5 minutes. And the "Multiplayer" games that you have to first unlock by beating tracks in single player mode are a complete joke. Dont waste your hard earned money on this one.	negative
title: TERRIBLE ACTING [SEP] content: This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie.	negative
title: leaks, leaks, leaks, [SEP] content: In the long term, a year or less expect this coffee maker to leak....everywhere. The dial indicator will fog up and will not be able to read it. We have the red one. Looks great on the counter, but the metal will begin to rust...yes rust..and corrode around the bottom (where it meets the plastic. So off to find another one....any suggestions?Mr. Coffee blew it this time.Beautiful on the outside, but worthless on the inside.	negative
title: 1 Evil band. Parents BECAREFUL. [SEP] content: the vocals are awful... i have listened to their other albums and it pretty much is the same stuff, they simply can't get heavyand fast with their material.all of their vocalists are not clean but rather rough and scratchy; they all sing like cookie monster. i have seen infernus without corpsepaint and quite frankly the man is ugly. twilight of the idols is just a cool title for there album/cd but this band stinks. they travel to latin american countries for many of there concerts because they can't get an american tour. Conclusion, you are better off going to Karaoke night at the local club as compared to seeing these negative satanist nazi bozos trying to lure your son or daughter in into their world of hell, of the devil. the members are evil satanists. PARENTS DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE.	negative
title: Senseless Drivel [SEP] content: Even though the book is a rework of a previous work of his, I can only pray that he did not really write this piece of trash. This book was a complete waste of time. Thank god it read fast because of the short chapters.Patterson should stick to Alex Cross novels. I can't believe this book is still in the top fifteen of the New York Times bestseller list.	negative
title: Waste of money [SEP] content: When I received this item, part of the black coating (powder coating?) was already coming off around the area that was drilled for the lock. Upon attempting to install the fuel door, I discovered that the lock would not close onto the lock plate without significant trimming of the lock plate. So far I have turned the lock plate, which comes from the factory shaped like a 'C', into an 'L', and it looks like I will have to thin out the vertical section of the 'L' even more to get the lock to close. So much so as to worry me about whether the lock plate will hold together at all.	negative
title: Baaaad [SEP] content: I haven't received my products anymore! Gonna get the responsable people and sue them!!!! I wrote to Amazon but haven't hear anything from them!!!	negative
title: Not as good as I hoped [SEP] content: These little seed things dried out too quickly, and did not give the yield I got from more traditional seed starters. The ease of use was not worth it.	negative
title: Sadly, it fits but it doesn't work [SEP] content: It fits, but it doesn't work, don't buy this, buy a real HDMI to DVI-D cable if you want to play a video game console con your computor monitor	negative
title: o god give it up [SEP] content: ok people. lets get this straight. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE FAKE, WANNABE, RADIO-FRIENDLY, POP. they are not punk. if u want real punk buy M.I.A. The Complete Anthology by the germs. i am sick of all these people who do nothing but shop at hot topic and pretend they are punk. REAL PUNK IS ANGER. THIS PUNK IS FASHION.DESTROY EVERYTHING!	negative
title: Prices are too high and different colors different prices--Rip OFF! [SEP] content: These items are selling for different prices--It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price--what a cheat!	negative

title: I was an extra in this movie [SEP] content: I got paid $35.00 for 12 hours work. Brad Davis pushed me in the critical student protest scene. I'm the one in the blue sweater.	negative
title: Not new [SEP] content: This was clearly refurbished. The pink plates didn't even match and some of them were worn and dirty looking. It's also set with Cingular backgrounds and logos, I have T-Mobile. Didn't like that either. If they sell something for 100.00 and say it's new, it should be new!	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: Just arrived and no worky worky. [SEP] content: Drawer does not open and close. Brand new out of the box. Haven't even tried to see if the microwave works but it looks like I made a bad decision. Now on a brand new appliance I have to call for service and that does not look good from here.Do not buy this product!	negative
title: Underpowered [SEP] content: I owned the predecesssor to this model which was a 12 volt rechargable which hung on the wall in its recharger. the plastic impeller came apart (bad plastic or design) and tried to buy the part. I couldn't do it so I bought this 18 volt cordless model. it has considerably less power than the 12 volt, which had a battery about twice the size of the 18.volt. I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model. Only consider this machine if you have a small area to do and nothing very heavy to blow.	negative
title: Great slipper [SEP] content: My husband loves his new slippers, because they're super cozy and very warm. They're really well made. I'd recommend these to anyone.	positive
title: not bad [SEP] content: This thing is still going strong after 1 year and my 3 year old submitting it to daily beatings. Would definitely buy again.	positive
title: A classic if ever there was one! [SEP] content: This book is great! Not only does it give me a feel of how life might be durinng end times, but the series only gets better! I learned so much and was inspired to read Revealation in my Bible! This book WILL NOT bore you and was an ingenious idea. I won't give anything away to you, all I can say is READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
title: Love this TV Series [SEP] content: I hate that this TV series didn't stay on the air longer. It has a great story line with lots of drama and action. It is also a get show to watch and learn about things you might want to stock up on in case of a horrible national disaster.	positive
title: So Much Fun [SEP] content: My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!	positive
title: Start them on Blackford Oakes when they're young. [SEP] content: I tend to not appreciate fiction. I read a lot of brain candy as a child, but one day in my early teens I picked up this book.1) I met William F. Buckley, Jr.2) I saw revolutionaries from a different angle.3) I developed a desire to read books with substance.4) I was innoculated against Steinbeck.It's engaging fiction that young people can enjoy. Let them get a little bit of this perspective before their pinko profs get them.	positive
title: Outdated sure, but still relevant [SEP] content: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.	positive
title: Awesome book [SEP] content: I really cannot say enough about this book and how illuminating it is to all of the facets of who Jesus is. We have been using it in a Bible study and I'm giving it to everyone I know. It's a quick, easy read, but packed with insight to really give you a lot to think about and meditate on. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is seeking to know Jesus better.	positive
title: truck strap [SEP] content: I use these straps for my weekly trips to the dump here in rural New Hampshire. I love going to the dump. It's one of the highlights of my weekly routine.DB	positive
title: Great musical toys for little hands [SEP] content: This set is great for younger children. I bought them for my 9 month old daughter and they were perfect for her little hands!	positive
title: Hello Kitty [SEP] content: This band is a mix of French and Germans, who sing in five different langauges. Their first record was quirky and decadent, and very over the top. My Melody relies on more subtlety within the band and more cover versions, especially heavy on the Serge Gainsbourg influence. Lead singer, Franoise Cactus is slowly becoming a legend in the international moogcore jetset pantheon. "Discjockey" is a danceable song which sound more like the first record, but most of this one is more torch and tragic. For the fans of Franois Hardy and Gainsbourg, this one is for you. Many club people who live for dressing up retro and fuzzy can't seem to get enough of Stereo Total.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)	positive
title: Power! [SEP] content: The best product I have bought for my camera. It makes my xti look like a large pro camera. and I love the ability to turn the camera 90 degrees and shoot.I have lots of battery life. I mean lots! the camera sits in my case ready to go for days and I never have to worry about running out of batteries or recharging. I charge it once a month, and I am good to go.I also like the AA battery insert, instead of the rechargeable, I could go into any store and buy AA batteries and be ready to go.I had no problem securing the grip to my camera. I was just careful to install it the first time. I will never take it off!	positive

title: Energy Tapping - a new level in healing [SEP] content: This book presents an easy way that even a skeptic can use and get results in dealing with issues that have posed emotional barriers within your life. A must read for anyone who is trying to overcome trauma on any level.	positive
title: CAT-AEROBICS! :) [SEP] content: This cat toy is FANTASTIC! I don't think there is a single cat out there that can resist it. My two cats lunged at it in about two seconds as soon as I gave the ball a little shove to get their attention. They played with it together for about ten minutes straight and it was so amusing to watch them really get all energized over this toy jumping and slapping the ball to each other. They come play with it every time I pull it from the corner of the room.The cat scratcher middle is fantastic as well. I don't have a scratching post so when ever they start getting frisky and clawing my upholstered chairs I just slide out the scratcher and they immediately use that instead! Fantastic toy ...buy one for yourself and any friends who may have a sweet feline!I've had mine since August 2010 and im now on to the second side of the scratching card in case you're wondering if to get extras. You'll have some happy cats with this one!	positive
title: Great little tool! Well built, comfy, light, powerful [SEP] content: Similar to the panasonic/milwaukee 3.6v driver but better. It is a little bigger but not much, grips better due to the nice rubber nubs in the grip, has an LED that can be turned on or off, and a nice size forward and reverse thumb switch. It has a quick release chuck that holds the bit unlike the others I mentioned, so your bits don't fall out. I own the milwaukee also, so I know of which I speak. Full range clutch that can even do light drilling. Comes with a nice charger and TWO batteries. Again, beats the others in overall value and features. Well built and ergonomically excellent. Also comes with a nice little case, again the others don't. Great deal on a great tool. You'll find yourself using this on every project that requires screws, nut drivers or small drill bits.	positive
title: Eye-opening [SEP] content: One might say that we have grown into a Peter Pan generation, judging by the infantile nature of our civilization	positive
title: Romantic [SEP] content: This is a wonderful collection of romantic music. The Harp is absolutely exquisite in this collection.	positive
title: Just about perfect! [SEP] content: From the prologue, I felt captivated by this book to it's very end. Wonderfully written! It was moving and fast paced. The only thing that may turn some readers off is some punctuation errors but they are easy to overlook with such powerful content.	positive
title: It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy [SEP] content: Outstanding example of the way things should be done! Wonderful and helpful insight. Thank you.	positive

title: a well-organized introduction to policy studies [SEP] content: Weimer's "Policy Analysis -3rd edition" provides a well-organized, widely-covered, and easily-understandable introduction to policy analysis. Although we have to seek for other materials for an in-depth analysis of some topics, the book helps us start with Public Policy, Policy Analysis, and even economic policies. This is especially good for undergraduate level, since this provides how to study, investigate, and write policy paper.	positive
title: THIS IS THE BEST CD [SEP] content: I LOVE ALL OF THE SOMGS OF THIS CD, I THINK THIS IS THE BEST MASS CHOIR IN MISSISSIPPI. OUR CHOIR SUNG THE SONG "THE'VE GOT THE WORD". THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD, BESIDES "EMMANUEL" , WHICH IS MY NEXT FAVORITE. I SING SOPRANO IN MY CHOIR IN HATTIESBURG, MS, I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SING IN THE MS MASS CHOIR, MAYBE WHEN THEY HAVE AN OPENING, OR NEED MORE HELP, I WILL BE GLAD TO HELP.MISSISSIPPI MASS CHOIR EMMANUEL "GOD WITH US" IT'S ON HIT, OH I ALSO HAVE THE CD AT HOME. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE CHOIR MEMBERS.	positive
title: A very original and mystical love story! [SEP] content: The Author done something remarkable: he has succeeded in adapting a great Sufi classic, "The Parliament of the Birds" by Atar in the contemporary world of pop music. It is a highly enjoyable read and yet very profound. I loved it!	positive
title: Angels & Demons by Dan Brown [SEP] content: I have read several of Mr Brown's books and enjoyed them all. Loved the DaVinci code but then someone suggested Angels and Demons. So I gave it a try. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. The storyline was interesting and believable. I love the way his stories unfold piece by piece. Would gladly reccomend this book to any and all.	positive
title: Decking review [SEP] content: Excellent book for the home DIY person. If you thinking of hiring contractors to put in a deck, forget it, buy this book and DIY.	positive
title: Revisit or discover it [SEP] content: I owned this in 1980 and loved it but what did I know, I was 9 years old. By the time I turned 11, I'd moved on to something atrocious probably. Anyway, I picked up a copy of this CD as a goof only to realize that this CD has some catchy (though rather amateurish) songs but better yet, it sounds great! When's the last time recorded guitars sounded like this? Basically, this is way more than teen pop. It's hard not to ape Rick's guitar playing when "I've Done Everything For You" is blaring, trust me. To summarize, buy it for a loved one today!	positive
title: Well's second best book [SEP] content: Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it will never match my favorite of his 'The Island of Doctor Moreau.' 'The Time Machine' did seem to start off a little slow and a little to science fiction for my taste. However, it became more stimulating and full of action as the story progressed.	positive
title: perfect!! [SEP] content: I was looking for this kind of socks to wear on my wedding day! And they are perfect, exactly what i was looking for!. Good quality, comfortable, good price and delivered on time!	positive
title: Good read! [SEP] content: A pleasant book. This book is somewhat wordy, but I liked it. She should have leftout parts about the kitten.	positive
title: Where have you been all my life? [SEP] content: I love building a fire on cold nights, so I use a lot of fire starters. These are by far the cheapest and best fire starters that I've used. They burn HOT. I am very impressed. I'll be using more of these as soon as I can burn through some of the other ones that I've accumulated. I don't foresee buying any other fire starters ever.	positive
title: Pokemon Sapphire is great! [SEP] content: I love this game! I own it in Japanese and it's awesome!the Game play is cool, you can now battle with 2 Pokemon at a time, the Pokedex is cool, and you can link up to 4 players at a time! Seriously, i am looking forward to the North American Release! People: If your a true Pokemon fan, buy this game! It is the most promising pokemon game ever!Newly found information: There is a total of 135 new pokemon. Which makes the grand total(drum roll please!)......... 386 Pokemon!! Sadly, the most i heard you can find is 200. So, you will probably have to buy both games to get them all.Special: Gamers in Japan got a Special boat ticket at a Pokemon Fair and it took them to an island where they could find Latios(in SAPPHIRE) and Latias(IN RUBY). Hopefully there will be an event like this going to malls in different states as previous times.	positive
title: Finally, the complete set! [SEP] content: The thin cases are a welcome addition when you buy this "upgrade" edition. The picture quality of the DVDs is top notch. An outstanding collection.	positive
title: A valuable resource with hard to find information [SEP] content: When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.	positive
title: Wow [SEP] content: Adam Scott wasn't really on my radar but I caught him in the last Season 2 episode of Eastbound and Down. A couple nights later, "The Vicious Kind" was on one of my cable channels. Good God. He has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. Really good movie and he was smoking hot in it.	positive
title: Nipple Nibblers [SEP] content: I really like this product. I don't think it's something I will be using on my nipples, but it sure makes a good chapstick!	positive
title: It's the BEST! [SEP] content: Originally I had the aluminum cups that were not double lined and they did not keep anything cold and all they did was sweat all over everything. We were going to Hawaii and I knew I just had to find a better solution. So I gave these a try. OMG!!! The are the BEST cup ever. We would put water, soda, flavored water - whatever - in the cup in the morning with some ice. Then drive around all day and leave the cups in a car that was over 100 degrees and by the end of the day the beverage was still ice cold and the ice had not even melted all the way. Absolutely amazing. You just can't go wrong. Easy to drink from, no sweating - it is perfect. I am keeping these babies under lock and key when our son comes over and wanders off with the hodge-podge of cups and glasses we have, never to be seen again.	positive
title: The title track kept this one from getting five stars [SEP] content: The new songs on this album are some of REK's best. Unfortunately the title track isn't a song at all, rather a rambling monologue that brings to mind J. Geils' "No Anchovies Please". Basically it just wastes space on the disc that would have been put to better use by adding another song.Also, between West Textures and the live album, do we really need a new version of The Road Goes On Forever? I don't think so!	positive
title: Alaskans like to listen to it to keep warm! [SEP] content: A friend of mine just flew in from T&T and she got me hooked on these tunes. To describe Soca is a little like Reggae on a sugar high. Very bouncy and very full of life and energy. Bright sounds that make you want to jump around your living room. Very good for cold dreary days in AK!	positive
title: Great kitchen! [SEP] content: My 18 month old boy normally has a very short attention span (sound familiar?!), but this kitchen/grill set keeps him actively engaged for quite a while! He loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.My husband and I put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. I'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. The instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!All of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? I agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!I definitely recommend this toy!	positive
title: kmtcpp [SEP] content: I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his "bad ones" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the "stuttgart aria" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion.	positive
title: Truly delightful once you get past the whole dead kittens thing. [SEP] content: I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. My only real criticism of the book was that I found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which I loved) to be a touch predictable. Really there was only one of two ways it could go, so I suppose that was unavoidable. BUT, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). The writing was stellar, as you would expect from Gaiman, and the story was quite original. It's like he mashed up The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, put it underneath modern day London, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. I absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. So well done, sir. Well done indeed.	positive
title: Good songs...a walk down memory lane. [SEP] content: A walk down memory lane when music was fun and the beat was 'catchy'. I like it.	positive
title: Great deal for quality product [SEP] content: I forget exactly what I paid for these headphones, but I'm pretty sure it was less the twenty bucks. The item showed up promptly, and it was just what I was looking for. A simple pair of headphones, comfortable, functional, and they sound great. If you don't need anything top of the line, and are looking for a good pair of headphones at a extremely fair price, these are for you.	positive
title: Knotwork [SEP] content: I have not yet drawn knots from this book, but I have worked through Celtic Knots-Mastering the Traditional Pattern which I recommend at a first book for beginners like myself. However, I had read this book and can't wait to start drawing its knots.	positive
title: So Great! [SEP] content: This is my first digital camera and I love it! It's small and very easy to use. There's plenty of advanced features to add effects on the computer and different modes which are a lot of fun to mess around with when taking random shots. The battery lasted through several nights of going out (with turning the camera on and off)and the picture quality is fantastic! I would highly recommend this camera to first time buyers, or to anyone who wants a new, easy-to-use one!	positive
title: Excellent information & advice! [SEP] content: This book was suggested to our Sewing Guild during a recent class on fitting. Many of us struggle with finding our own style based on the shape of our bodies. This book gives excellent advice on clothing styles, accessories, shoes, and even makeup suggestions - "don't overdo it"! Classic white shirts, great-fitting jeans, and coats. And, it provides you with brand suggestions as well as where you can get them. Ready-to-wear doesn't fit most of us so they suggest finding a great tailor to help with the fit. Thank goodness WE can do that now! I purchased 6 copies of the book for some of our Guild members and I have someone else requesting 2 more copies. I highly recommend this book as an excellent guide to finding and creating your own style.	positive
title: Huge Hit! [SEP] content: I bought this for my 15 month old son and he loved it!! He pushes is around every where and it actually sucks some! I had to empty it after days of work :).Amber	positive
title: Cardio [SEP] content: I have the Mat workout DVD which I really enjoy. I wasn't sure about the Cardio DVD having read wildly varied reviews from "love it" to "hate it". But, I thought I'd give it a try anyway.My verdict: I really like it. It's not for everyone though.If you just want to put your workout DVD in the player and follow the instructor's commands, then this DVD is definately not for you.However, if you are prepared to put effort into learning routines then you will probably enjoy it. The start of the DVD she goes through each dance combination step by step. Basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it. When doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.The routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat. I have some dancing experience but not a lot.I like it because it's a bit different and fun to do. It's pretty high intensity cardio.	positive
title: Used as biotechnological narrative [SEP] content: In his article, Ethnographic Critique and Technoscientific Narratives: The old mole, ethical plateaux, and the governance of emergent biosocial polities, in Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry (25: 355-93. 2001)Michael M.J. Fischer uses this book as a juxtaposition to ethnographic descriptions of bio-ethical realties. It's rather interesting and may possibly add some insight into the novel	positive
title: my abs look good since i started it [SEP] content: i bought this product with the recommendation of my energetically ripped friend. i have to say even tho im not as ripped as him, i love maintaining my body and this helped	positive
title: Keep them coming! [SEP] content: Hooray! I was wondering about the 4th season; it's good to know they're still coming. I'll buy every single season. I think I'll throw up if I read about someone complaining about the packaging on this one--who cares! As long as the DVDs are being released, don't complain!	positive
title: It's a Guy Thing [SEP] content: Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss.	positive
title: The Book of Lists for Teens [SEP] content: The Book of Lists for Teens is an entertaining read for teens of all ages. The book address issues from dating to dealing with racism. Sometimes the advice is serious; others are just plain silly. I like the variety in this book although some lists are more interesting and useful than others. This book gives the readers a lot of miscellaneous facts - perfect for those who love trivia! If the reader is reading this for the first time, my suggestion is to skip around - reading it back to front is dull, and some subjects simply may not interest the reader. All in all, a book worth checking out!	positive
title: Castles and cold white legs [SEP] content: Trying to vididly recall late childhood is a nearyl impossisble task - let alone getting the mood and emotions down in print. Royal Blue does it wonderfully.The main charatcter is in turns the wandering, homeless waif and then, convincingly, the object of desire.A must read for anyone who enjoys an honest, sharply observing voice.	positive
title: Good value vac [SEP] content: Even after reading great reviews of this vacuum we were surprised how much we liked it: Amply powered, with a decent sized dirt cavity, the low price is pretty unbelievable. All in all it's a great deal but I have two complaints: I would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. It has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw.	positive
title: SAVE YER DOSH WITH TOSH! [SEP] content: I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER AND I THINK IT IS GREAT, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE. AC-3,DTS(OUTPUTS)GOOD FEATURES, AND GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY FOR A GREAT PRICE."BUY IT NOW"	positive
title: Amazing Movie [SEP] content: I don't often leave reviews but I felt that this movie deserved it. When you watch the trailer or read the description, this movie comes off sounding stupid. When it came out I decided not to see it but after my friend told me he saw it and i decided to check it out. This movie is great. It keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. This movie has such a sad and wonderful story about Jamil. All the things he went through. But there is no doubt this a 5 star movie. I have it pre-ordered and I cant wait to watch again.	positive
title: Breathtaking! [SEP] content: This is a truly beautiful work. I've bought some CDs at the local record store and was very disappointed before I wised up and started looking through the reviews here at Amazon for some better material. This looks not like a Western collection, but like an actual Chinese CD. The liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, Parting and Yang Guan, is particularly moving. The instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (I don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not "play" but rather "sings" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies. The haunting voice of this instrument weaves itself all throughout the pieces, narrating stories that are foreign and yet very, very real to a western listener. This collection really deserve the title "Masterpieces". I only wish I knew where to find other works of this high quality.	positive
title: Great for a beginner [SEP] content: Not being a computer or camera "pro" I needed something easy to use. I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second "movie". Boy do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a digital camera that is easy to use. Thanks Amazon for providing the reviews, and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews. I found them very helpful.	positive
title: Great ideas. [SEP] content: I've been gathering and saving ribbon for years - now I have some great ideas for how to use some of it! This book has so many projects that I almost don't know where to start, but my favorites are the greeting cards - they all look so professional and elegant. Thanks, Heidi, for another "Simply Beautiful" book.	positive
title: a very useful reveiw article collection [SEP] content: It contains very useful review articles. a short description about objectives, materials and methods, and results is very clear and easy to be understood.I know that the 3rd edition is published recently, so I could get the book in your store.	positive
title: this book is the best [SEP] content: this book is an excellent work, which portrayed the struggle between good and evil brilliantly	positive
title: Feeder Funnel [SEP] content: Fit perfectly. Makes the corn run completely out of the feeder so there is no residue left to go bad. Very easy to install and works like a charm.	positive
