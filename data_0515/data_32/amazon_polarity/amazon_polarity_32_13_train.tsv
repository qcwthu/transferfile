title: Not good [SEP] content: Did not like the book really boring might be a classic .but I'm to good for this horrid book sorry	negative
title: Not Worth It, Get the Neat Instead! [SEP] content: I got the diaper genie before my daughter was born. We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always "escaped". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!	negative
title: a waste of money [SEP] content: I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.	negative
title: JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS! [SEP] content: I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic "flashbacks" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one "enlightened" person mentioned in the book had "higher" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible.	negative
title: Left me wanting [SEP] content: I just finished True Believer and I am so glad that I got this from the library, rather than purchasing it.It makes for an enjoyable read, but it seemed rather shallow & superficial. I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong.	negative
title: I'd give ATI NO stars if I could... [SEP] content: This company will tell you that the card is in stock... They lie to the hands that feed them. The products are good if you can get one. I am never going to give ATI my $$ again.	negative
title: Headsets Fall Apart [SEP] content: The sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. The cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if I ever wear them. I needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....I expect better for $300![Look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]	negative
title: The Duprees All time greatest hits CD audio [SEP] content: I ordered this audio cd for my husband who has two songs on a Doo Wop VHS of the Duprees singing his favorite two songs.Since the cover said all-time greatest hits, I thought it would be great as a gift for him.He was totally disappointed. The cd had his two favorite songs. The rest he had never heard of or they had been recorded by other singers who did a much better job of recording the songs. Not worth the price.	negative
title: Not as pictured [SEP] content: It isn't the same color as pictured, highly disappointing, and sound quality sucks. Was trying to replace a lost par of skull candy headphones, these do not compare.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: The author's intent was to display his error-free ego [SEP] content: Gen. Matthew Ridgeway is so full of himself that he cannot err. He is quick to point out his perfection by comparing himself to others of his calling, and although forced by history and fact to admit the other fine leaders of the 8th army did actually perform well in Korea, he is obviously reluctant to write of anything unless the sentence begins with "I". His book is garbage, and I'm ashamed to have served under him in that war.	negative
title: Not very helpful for our kids [SEP] content: This book was not helpful for us in terms of really engaging our kids, and we found the writing dry. There is a sexist streak too that won't win the hearts of mothers or daughters.	negative
title: Buy the music, read better books, live the blues... [SEP] content: I really resent the titles of the "XXXX for Dummies," since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy... The book is OK. Man, the blues is music. Get out there, get the CDs, Hound Dog Taylor, Rev. Gary Davis, Miss. John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies. Nah.	negative
title: very disappointed [SEP] content: I received the massage cushion in damaged position. The back massage portion would not work.	negative
title: Nice idea, but DOESN'T WORK [SEP] content: I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) And if your goal is WEIGHT MAINTENANCE while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. But you will NEVER NEVER NEVER lose weight with this.	negative
title: A disappointing production of a great novel [SEP] content: This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice.	negative
title: sold out [SEP] content: i think keane sold out. their first cd was amazing and this one sort of fizzled and died. if they could reconnect with whatever it was that made their first one so great, they'd be back in business.	negative
title: NO SUPPORT - STAY AWAY [SEP] content: I ordered tapered proxabrush refills. I received wide instead. I called the company left messages and no one returned the call. I did not pursue it further as it was not worth my time for a $4 item	negative
title: Sorry. This one just doesn't make it. [SEP] content: I was real disappointed when I saw this movie. It wasn't as good as Look Who's Talking, the first episode, and it was worse than Look Who's Talking Two. It was a waste of time.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: Very Bad Movie!! [SEP] content: This was a very very bad movie. The script was awful. The actors over acted. In many scenes they got overly emotional and cried, what was suppose to look like crying, became forced crying with no tears. Which was down right awful!!!I am sorry I don't have anything good to say about this movie!!	negative
title: Great premise, poor execution [SEP] content: I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a high school creative writing project can get suchgreat reviews, based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so. Yes, the Truth Machine isa great idea. Yes, it would change the world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates. But,this work of "speculative fiction" falls a bit short of impressive on the storytelling front. Thecharacters are one-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and the dialogue wooden. As apremise for a story, it's great: recommended. As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed.	negative
title: Disappointing, sorely lacking in details [SEP] content: After reading the positive reviews on this book, I hoped this book would tell me things MSDN did not. How wrong I was. There is more information on MSDN than can be found in this book. For example, in Chapter 1, the author lists the function ExecuteInDomain, referring to Chapter 7 for details. In Chapter 7, the ExecuteInDomain function is not even mentioned. Also, the author often leaves out crucial details that would allow you to actually understand the point he is trying to make.	negative
title: the partial image of a ghost of a story [SEP] content: I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of "A Jolly Corner"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion."Washington Square" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form.	negative
title: Norah Let me Down [SEP] content: In Summary - Pretty Lame.She should stick to what she does well - singing other peopls songs.This one doesnt sound like the previous albums, doesnt show case Norah's voice. Just a rich brat complaining.	negative
title: A lot of interesting stuff not here [SEP] content: C;mon Sire! There's way more interesting stuff than this! Where is "Ave Maria" by West India Company or "Stop!" by Data or "Close Your Eyes" by Deborah Harry or "Uncertain Smile" by The The or "Big Hollow Man" by Danielle Dax.	negative
title: did not work [SEP] content: After all the good reviews I thought I was going to get a quality toy... I guess it's a gamble.. Ours worked for a few minutes then stopped working.. Batteries replaced but no luck... Paid full price and shipping so I wasn't pleased.	negative
title: Not worth your time [SEP] content: The two best things I can say about this movie are 1) it is very short, and 2) I rented it so can return it asap. I don't watch movies like this for the plot (good thing!) or the cast, but for the special effects. Which in this case means a whole lot of camera shaking. It makes no sense, there are way too many holes in it, and what in the world is up with Judd Nelson's hair?	negative
title: Waste of Time [SEP] content: Starting homeschooling my 4, 8 & 6 year olds and was wondering what to teach when they need to learn things and where can I find this information. This book did not contain that information is lists books and other information that you can find your self online or in basic homeschooling books. So its just sitting on my shelf collecting dust.	negative
title: Mount incompatible with other Kidde alarms [SEP] content: I bought this alarm hoping it would be an upgrade from the EXTREMELY poor-quality Kidde alarms that came with our house (they are supposedly 3 years old but most have already failed catastrophically - they are Kidde 0915 if you are in the same situation). However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier. It won't.	negative
title: I would have given it a 0. [SEP] content: This has got to be the worst Star Wars book ever.I swear it was a chore reading it.The characters acted nothing like the ones we have come to love(i.e.Luke manipulating his image in Han's mind),they felt like total strangers!The description sounded good,the book could've been good, alas it sucked.Keep away from this book.It will feel like you are doing a chore reading it;save your time and go read a Zahn or Anderson novel.	negative
title: What is so funny? [SEP] content: Please look the back of the DVD cover and see if they have subtitles or CC (Closed Captions). I am deaf and want to read what they are saying.I appreicated it and thank you.	negative
title: This game rocks! [SEP] content: I'd been playing AOE1 before this and it was one of the best games I'd encountered. This one totally blows it away. Better graphics, more tech capabilities and better civilization armies make this game worth every penny. For all those reviewers on this site who say stick with another game (Warcraft or Seven Kingdoms or whatnot), give AOE2 a chance.	positive
title: Highly recommended reading for students of Buddhism. [SEP] content: Gay Watson, et.al. edit The Psychology Of Awakening, which provides an important survey of Buddhism and science in daily lives. Essays consider Buddhist influences in psychology and social settings alike.	positive
title: Pregnancy + back 'N Belly = Better Sleep [SEP] content: This is my first pregnancy and I was glad i decided to invest in this. Sure I still don't sleep the whole night through because of nightly potty breaks but that's pretty much what I wake up for not because a pillow slips out of bed or aching hips. Occasionally I'll wake up to turn over, but it so much easier to get comfortable again without adjusting a zillion pillows. I had some trouble with the seam at the top of the pillow at first, but after breaking the pillow in a little it doesn't bother me. I remedied the problem at first by sleeping with the pillow upside down. I thought the purchase was way worth it.	positive
title: Beautiful Writing Held me by the Throat! [SEP] content: Anne Rice deserves all the fame and fortune she's accumulated! Interview with the Vampire is storytelling at its finest. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but she drew me in on the very first page, making me care about Louis, the vampire struggling with his humanity. Her language is visual, beautiful and original. Rice surprises, while making you believe. And she leaves you with a satisfying twist. A very satisfying read.	positive
title: Best deal for the price! [SEP] content: The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.	positive
title: One of the best albums ever! [SEP] content: After such a great first album, I was worried about their sophomore album not living up to my expectations, but I'm happy to say that they far exceeded them. This is one of the best Christian albums I have ever heard. Every song is full of spiritual vision and power, very uplifting. I have listened to this album non-stop since I purchased it and I'm still not tired of it.	positive
title: works for me... [SEP] content: I am very satisfied with this product so far. Ironically, about ten minutes after I put on the keyboard cover, I spilled my drink on my computer. Nothing got in my keyboard :). The cover comes folded up in a little box and takes a few days to fully straighten out, but other than that it definitely serves its purpose...	positive
title: A Great Book! [SEP] content: This is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike! I bought this with my birthday money, and the humorous text urged me to snatch it from the shelves. It's a book to read when in the bowels of "Dog Ownwer Despair". If you love or like dogs, this is a book you NEED to have!	positive
title: Very good, very personal [SEP] content: Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's "Straight up" and "Wish you were here" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. "Golders Green" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. "Dawn" is a beutiful Psych ballad,"Makes me feel so good" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.	positive
title: Fantastic! [SEP] content: Excellent so far - I have only begun reading it, but it is very good and I know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience. Highly recommended to any serious strength/bodybuilding athlete.	positive
title: A classic [SEP] content: Many people think this album was the last of Nofx's ability to label themselves as punk rock and retain a sense of dignity. I happen to disagree with these people. Anyhoo, this album is a real classic. It's when Nofx really got there s..tuff together. Fat Mikes story telling seems much more fine tuned in Punk in Drublic than in more recent things. Contains tons of energy and clever lyrics. Anyways, to summurize:This is one of the best punk albums ever and if you don't like this...you probably don't like punk. But don't feel bad....punk doesn't like you either.	positive
title: OMG!! HILARIOUS isnt the word!!!!! [SEP] content: If you want to have a fun night of laughing til it hurts, then you need to get this Jeff Dunham DVD!! I never heard of him, but a friend recommended the DVD, and OH MY GOSH, it was soooo hilarious. He is not a 'raunchy' comedian/vantriliquist. He doesnt have to use profanity like others do to get the crowd going. Jeff Dunham ROCKS!!!!! Both of his DVD's are awesome. Get them both!!!Jeff Dunham - Arguing With MyselfJeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity	positive
title: Well worth the cost [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They live by the beach and she puts all her beach "stuff" in the wagon including her son, Joey, and wheels it to where they will sit on the sand. She says the wagon wheels are great on the sand and Joey loves the ride.Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon	positive
title: Thin, light and stylish [SEP] content: I got this watch to replacethis guyand I'm satisfied. The Timex is too large and heavy for my wrist: the metal band couldn't get small enough and the heavy watch always made its presence known. The Skagen is also noticeably quieter than the Timex. Why?The Skagen is thin and light and I have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. I was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.The calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band.	positive
title: comprehensiveand factual [SEP] content: I'm a huge Doors fan, particularly Jim Morrson. I've read a lot of different accounts of his life and this was a really good summation of all my reading. I thought the format was interesting. Good film.	positive
title: AWESOME! [SEP] content: Dancehall Reggae, Soca, and Reggaeton all mixed together one one CD? This compilation is a dream come true. Miami radio station Power 96's Eddie Mix brings the sexy flavor of Miami to wherever you are. If there is a soundtrack to the vibe of Miami this is it! You should probably buy 2 of these because one of your will friends will definitely steal it.	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: I bought one of these 10yrs ago, just died lots ofrattling noises, I tried to see if it was loss screws butwith no success, so I bought 2 more, they are great.Love fans that make noise, easier to block outside noisesspecially during the day. We use one in our bedroom the otherin our sons room.	positive
title: It is fun and a nice car [SEP] content: It is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.	positive
title: Very useful [SEP] content: I am an environmental engineer but not a wastewater treatment specialist, and have found this text very helpful. It has a good level of detail without getting excessively technical.	positive
title: Brain Lock [SEP] content: Very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.I would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have OCD or not .The value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.The message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and I have taken the authors advice to my benefit.It does go on a bit too much about the world of OCD sufferers which I got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . This is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with OCD and their families .I highly recommend this book.	positive
title: John Denver DVD [SEP] content: A Songs Best Friend - John Denver Remembered is a collection of interviews with a lot of people who knew John and some clips of John. This is not a concert by John but a series of people who knew John (his ex wife, manager, etc) There is some of John's music in the background (and 4 of John's songs in another section (Special Effects) but this is mostly people talking about John. I saw this on PBS but at the time they were having pledge breaks. The DVD does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. Even PBS may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.	positive
title: Good Product [SEP] content: The product is very simple to setup for a PC. It is very quiet, and shuts down when not in use. The instructions for linking to a MAC are not that good, and I have yet to figure out how to share my HP OfficeJet printer via this device.	positive
title: Before There was Conan, There was Kull... [SEP] content: For Robert E. Howard neophytes, a little background. REH created Kull prior to Conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. What few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical Conan tale. Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.One of those was "By This Axe I Rule," which was loosely adapted to become "The Phoenix on the Sword," as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	positive
title: Ran the Stoplight? [SEP] content: Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.	positive
title: Musical suprise of 2004 [SEP] content: So much hate for the ex Miss Universe I see. Why? This is a solid pop/rock effort and Alicia is one of the biggest musical surprises of 2004. She's got a lovely voice, think María Conchita Alonso meets Lisa Marie Presley. The best track on this album has to be EL PAÍS DE LAS MARAVILLAS. I can not begin to tell you how many times I listen to this song! It should have been the first single. Really give her a chance. Some great songs. I hope to God she records a follow up.	positive
title: Clay and Ruben fan [SEP] content: I think Ruben's cd is great - very easy to listen to and sing along with. He really pulls you into it. I voted for Clay during AI but bought both the cd's and will support both of these talented young men.	positive
title: pretty good cover [SEP] content: This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.	positive
title: My 2 Year Old Loves It! [SEP] content: We got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she won't even be 2 years old until January. I decided to let her open it early, just to see if I should buy furniture for it or not. She hardly ever plays with anything more than 5 minutes, but this holds her attention for hours at a time. She loves it. She talks to them and makes them interact with each other. The house is made very well too, she likes to stand on the bottom floor and it holds her! I bought her some more people and another horse for it. I still can't believe how good she is doing with it. I'm sure it will be her favorite toy for quite some time!	positive
title: THE BEST SALES BOOK IN THE WORLD [SEP] content: I got into the sales line recently. Badly needing advice on how to succeed in it, I have read a couple of sales books. But I don't seem to learn much and was not at all inspired by them. Until, I discovered this book by Frank Bettger. Reading this book, I found Frank a very sincere person, one happy to pass on all the successful sales experiences he had garnered to readers.No doubt about is. This is the best sales book in the world. Any reader will benefit tremendously from it.	positive
title: Inspirational Book for anyone interested in mosaic-ing [SEP] content: I bought this for my sister-in-law who started doing mosaics but had no reference material. She loves it! Kaffe has an eye for colour and design that can't be faulted, and the instructions are clear and easily followable. There are a range of projects suitable for your home, or gifts. Great book, and I am in the good books with my sister-in-law!	positive
title: Beautiful [SEP] content: This cd is composed of all the background music to the incredible anime series, Rurouni Kenshin. There are 2 vocal tracks on here, Sobakasu-The Opening Theme, and Tears Know-one of the ending songs. The music is absolutley gorgeous, this is one of the few anime series that has great music. This really is a cd that you will want to add to your collection.	positive
title: Strong argument for the impossible [SEP] content: We know that the media is left-wing ; everybody knows that, right? Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think. While I think he overstates his case, this is an excellent, well-researched book.I don't think he'll change too many minds,as people who are convinced the media is liberal are not going to change their minds just by reading a book, even such a persuasive one as What Liberal Media.I would ask any readers of this book to read this with an open mind and perhaps you might come around to Alterman's point of view.	positive
