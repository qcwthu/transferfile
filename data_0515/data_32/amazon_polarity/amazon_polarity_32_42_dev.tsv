title: Look Elsewhere [SEP] content: Programming is very time consuming and can get down right frustrating. And the extra price for the useless remote control is silly. Come on, who seriously uses a remote control when you can just reach up & push the buttons or turn a knob, especially while you're trying to drive safely. Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car. This radidio really, really needs a SD memory card slot. Even a USB slot would have been acceptable, but I hate having a wire flopping around from my I-Pod.	negative
title: MUST READ [SEP] content: Hi! I did not read this book yet but my close friend Brandy said that THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!I have a baby now who is 6 months old and the method described in this book looks very interesting. Also, sounds like a hilarious read with some good facts about understanding your body. Nothing like a book with some good humor in it.PS- Brandy is pregnant!	negative
title: Another American Idol Miscalculation [SEP] content: There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards.	negative
title: Base started melting after a year [SEP] content: We liked this product very much at first, but it has not stood the test of time. After about a year we started smelling a burnt plastic smell when we used it. Now after another half year, the plastic base has begun to melt significantly. I opened it up and one of the power wires seems to be overheating. I'm going to buy another carafe, but not a Chef's Choice.	negative
title: Useless theories [SEP] content: This book lack proof big time. Most of what the authors say in this book are fallacies or opinions where we have to ask ourselves, "Is this really true?" or "Ahhh, this makes sense only because it is common sense." Without any knowledge of change management skills, half of the book is common sense.	negative
title: good timin [SEP] content: This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.	negative
title: Massacred!!!! [SEP] content: I was so excited to finally find a piece by Torroba "Twelve Interludes" for guitar and string quartet that I never heard before but have been looking for for a long time. Unfortunatly, the performers totally massacre this work. They have sloppy playing through out and the recording is dead acoustically. What a disapointment.	negative
title: For conoisseurs only! [SEP] content: As a non native English speaker and a former student in languages, I consider myself a pretty good speller. But I know that some people find English spelling really frightening. Unfortunately this is not a book for them.It is for people who master well enough the language and can make distinctions between various forms and spellings of English. Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: Not a real trooper... [SEP] content: This movie is Ok, with some fresh humor, but most of it is just plain old "shock humor". The plot and storyline is poor, and the actors are average at best. But, it's still is better than "Serendipity"!!	negative
title: Musical Kleenex [SEP] content: Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, "Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew." I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's "The Orange Album" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: By a CD player that is reliable and will last [SEP] content: I had wanted a CD player that would play lullabies for my son to help him relax and go to sleep. I returned this player 3 times before completely giving up on it. Every model I brought home failed to play an entire CD. It didn't matter whether it was sitting on a table or mounted on the side of the crib. It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat. What's even better - it will be useful to my son when he is old enough to play his own CDs and carry it around - a much better investment.	negative
title: Not worth the trouble [SEP] content: This product is very weak, not very powerful and unsuitable for massage it is just a toy and I sent it back	negative
title: Mathematical techniques of extremely limited usefullness [SEP] content: The two stars in my rating are not so much a comment on quality (although it has all the glitter of a 1940's graduate math tome), but as a warning that it is likely to be of value to an extremely limited audience. I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it.	negative
title: Worked great but a lot were broken [SEP] content: I couldn't find clay targets anywhere so I looked online and found them here. The targets were exactly what I was looking for but I expected to get a lot of broken clays as I had read in other reviews. Sure enough I did. I only received about 40 of the 90 clays intact. I was able to salvage about 5 others that had simple breaks that I could glue back together with ease. Still, the shipping costs greatly decreased the value of the clays and then only half the clays surviving transport made the value even worse. I will still search out clay targets but I will not have them (at least this brand) shipped to me again.	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Not As Good As Gold Cup [SEP] content: It is oil and will probably work for most Spyders and Tippmanns but I would still recommend getting Gold Cup oil for only a couple dollars more. The Gold Cup is much better at lubricating than this oil.	negative
title: great until it breaks [SEP] content: We bought this when we got a puppy and our daughter started potty training. It was great with cleaning up messes from both. HOWEVER, after not using it for a few months, I pulled it out to steam our couch, and it no longer worked-it wouldn't spray. I followed directions posted in a review to clean out the tubes, but that didn't work (and I broke off a piece of plastic taking off a tube because the tube had glued itself to the plastic). At any rate, it seems the heat box was no longer working and was overheating, and the heat light was on no matter what. When I put it back together, it still wouldn't spray, and then I could smell the machine overheating. I chucked it. Now I'm looking for a larger steam vac that will do whole carpets and upholstery.	negative
title: Not all Americans are Evangelical Christians! [SEP] content: The title, Ping Pong: A Play about American College Life suggests that this play creates an impression of life in an American college. When one begins to read this dross, one quickly realises that the title should be changed to 'American College Life: An Evangelical Christian Extremist perspective'. The content is tedious, predictable, and unrepresentative of life in colleges in the U.S., and the whole plot can be summed up in a pamphlet. The anti-Semitic and unpleasant religious undertones are particularly disturbing. The book should be avoided.	negative
title: Dont waste your $$$$ [SEP] content: This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going "old school" with a mechanical "bubble type" compass.	negative
title: Gauge Set? [SEP] content: I do not know how well this works, however, the picture and title indicates purchaser will receive two items. The title reads: "Malco FCMS Facing Gauge and Overlap Gauge Set." How can a "set" be only one? It is more than misleading, it is blatantly false if purchaser receives only one device.	negative
title: Very poor, not recommended [SEP] content: It sounded great and has great features, but manufacturing quality was horrible. The 'select' button didn't work most of the time, and the USB connector was very fussy.To make matters worse, it disconnected (bad USB connector) during download to my SD memory card and killed a $60 card.Then to add insult to injury, the customer service from RCA is absolutely awful. No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault. When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she told me that no one there could help me.For fun, I tried to contact the corporate offices. They don't seem to exist.I would not recommend purchasing a Lyra, or anything else from RCA.	negative
title: probably the worst movie i ever seen in years [SEP] content: this movie is totall junk, bad act, bad plot, bad actress, even the nude and sex scenes are annoying. this tile should go directly go tho garbage can. keep your money and stay away from this crap.	negative
title: not what they say it is [SEP] content: I was so mad when I got the package. The name for it is "travelmate cas seat", well...there was NO CAR SEAT !!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth $78, if it does not include a car seat!!! I was BS!!!	negative
title: Antonio, definitely not Desperado! [SEP] content: Really, just because 2 women get it on in a bathroom stall doesn't make this a great, ground-breaking film. So what?Antonio, I love watching your more gritty or your more humorous films. This story line really doesn't compliment your diverse acting abilities and it only tends to pigeon-hole you to specific roles. Bad move.Didn't like the female star in this. All fluff and no substance.Isabow	negative
title: Not worth $10 [SEP] content: I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - unfortunately, I paid almost $50. For me, this is the worst PSP game released to date. The graphics reek - pixelated and foggy, I was surprised at how low the quality was. This looks and feels like a PS1 game.I'll tell you how bad I think this game is ... even Need For Speed Underground Rivals, is better. That's saying a LOT.Please understand, I'm not a Midnight Club fan. If you love the franchise, I imagine you'll like this game, and hey, to each his own. But if you're a Gran Turismo fan, and you're looking for a realistic racing simulation, sad as it is, Ridge Racer for PSP is still your best bet so far.	negative
title: ccccrrrrrraaaaapppp! [SEP] content: this album is junk. they shouldn't be allowed to carry the name Crematory after this. bought this on a gamble and crapped out big time. this is just European poser metal with keyboards thrown in just to really piss you off. this one angers me every time i see it. if you like keyboard slathered weak crap then this is for you. as a matter of fact you can have mine.	negative
title: rock quarry [SEP] content: We have bought three of these, and on all of them, the rock quarry doesn't work. How can this toy be still on the shelves if it doesn't work?	negative
title: Liars [SEP] content: I have a scatmat and orderd two more. After a couple weeks they canceled the order because they are "out of stock". I go to the store site and they are still in stock but the price is a lot higher than before.	negative
title: Just Plain Boring [SEP] content: What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days.	negative
title: I give up. [SEP] content: While I never thought the Wheel of Time series was anything utterly extraordinary, the first three or so volumes were a fairly good read. But now it's become clear that Jordan is just treading water: Path of Daggers is a bloated, boring, virtually plot-free attempt to keep the series from heading towards any kind of conclusion. This is the last one I'm reading, period.	negative
title: For my Nephew : ) [SEP] content: When a child wants to read - you must provide. It was suitable and keeps his interests. Thanks!	positive
title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: What can I say but PURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT! [SEP] content: This is the perfect blend of people, cats, and mystery. Braun has gotten a style that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen while treating all of us cat lovers to two of the smartest cats on earth. All I cat say is don't start it until you can read it straight through because you will not want to put it down.	positive
title: Replacement straps for old lamp [SEP] content: The price was good and delivery excellent. The reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.Always be prepared. PS: This is a simple design that kicks the behind. A creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. For me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a Works Enduro Rider steering dampener.	positive
title: Great radio [SEP] content: This retro look radio has a great sound and good reception. I was surprised at the quality of the radio for the price. It is a fun item to talk about with friends.	positive
title: great movie! [SEP] content: I recently bought this dvd for my partner. we sat down and watched it 2gether. The story is about a young boy and his family, in some parts of this movie it can be a tear jerker. This movie will touch your heart, if you purchase it you wont be sorry. this movie has feeling.	positive
title: Get all 3 volumes NOW.... [SEP] content: before they are out of print. Full 12" versions on CD, excellent sound quality. Track times:1. da butt (5:08)2. let's go all the way (5:28)3. strut (5:50)4. rock steady (5:09)5. catch me i'm falling (5:54)6. politics of dancing (6:46)7. i'm too sexy (6:35)8. i don't want your love (7:33)9. walk the dinosaur (6:57)10. mony mony (5:00)	positive
title: Flight Simulator Delux [SEP] content: The simulator was delivered quicker than I expected. All parts work as advertised. My problem is my graphics card. I need to up date it. The simulator is slow and jerky. I will review it again when I get the card.Overall I am very satisfied.	positive
title: Typical Snowmen Fun [SEP] content: I love the snowmen books! They have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.	positive
title: Even Better than the Original [SEP] content: The songs on this CD are even better than the original High School Musical CD. There is a wide variety of music from the dance numbers like 'I don't dance',and 'Work it out', to the over-the-top songs such as Sharpay's 'Fabulous'. It includes some romantic songs such as 'Everyday' and a song where Troy realises he needs to make some changes in his life shown in the song 'Bet on it'. The songs certainly tell a story and make you want to see the movie. Great entertainment for kids and parents will enjoy this CD also.	positive
title: Helen Reddy [SEP] content: Contains two top 40 songs from the seventies that is not on her greatest hits album, Bluebird and Music Is My Life.	positive
title: So Much Fun [SEP] content: My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!	positive
title: True BUF Memories [SEP] content: It's difficult to add to the previously written reviews of this book, since those reviewers already said it all. I can only concur with their opinions and thoughts, and add that the book brings back a flood of memories. Since my particular experience was mainly with the BUF, I immensely enjoyed reading this book. From the boredom of alert duty to the tedious flights from Anderson to SEA during Arc Light, all may not have been glamour or glory. However, excitement and drama certainly did occur during those war days. The camaraderie and friendships that developed were deep and lasting. It's a "must read" for any former SAC mamber, especially B52 personel.	positive
title: Satified customer [SEP] content: I read the reviews on this product before making my purchase...some good, some not so good. When I first charged the battery (about 5 hours) and used the trimmer, I was disappointed. My fault. Then I charged the battery overnight and used the trimmer for about 30 minutes without taking my finger off the trigger. Not bad. Again...my fault. Then my wife used it and only pressed the trigger while she trimmed. She loves it and there were no issues with time restraints. We were able to trim out the entire area of our flower bed (about 20' by 20') with no issues at all. Then I trimmed for another 20 minutes using her technique. Great for trimming around pavers, walkways, and inside thick plant beds. This is a nice trimer, but the battery is definitely not a quick charge. Follow the instructions and it works well.	positive
title: Absorbing [SEP] content: Reading this reminded me a little of Murakami's The WindUp Bird Chronicles in terms of the surrealism. There was a time when people were made of paper. A boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. It's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.Certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.This is not a book for everyone, and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories.	positive
title: Great Toaster Oven [SEP] content: I really love this oven. The toaster feature at the top is great!! If you plan on doing cooking in the oven, it is important to preheat and turn the tray from front to back halfway through the cooking time. Things	positive
title: Daughter loved [SEP] content: Nice costume, but it was a little bit longer than expected. Worked fine at the end with a few pins.	positive
title: Annalee Classic Snowman [SEP] content: Perfect. I bought it at a great discount price, the item is in perfect condition and exactly what I would expect from an Annalee item. I was especially excited to be able add to my Annalee Christmas collection at this great price. I'm very pleased with the purchase, the easy with the purchase, and the prompt delivery. I look forward to more wonderful buys like this from Amazon.com.	positive
title: The Original! [SEP] content: I would have given this 5 stars, but settled for 4 because I was expecting the Re-release version with the new footage. Its the original theatrical release. Don't get me wrong, I love the original, but I was hoping at least for both versions of the film, like the DVD release had. I actually stopped it it when I realized it was the original and threw the DVD in!	positive
title: WONDERFUL [SEP] content: I LOVE THESE KNIVES. VERY MODERN LOOKING AND THEY WORK GREAT. MY HANDS NO LONGER GET TIRED FROM CUTTING AND THEY LOOK GREAT IN MY KITCHEN	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: One of my favorite [SEP] content: This book was one of the favorite I have ever read. Huxley disguises the meaning of the book at the beginning, but if you give it a chance, you will love it. The story of the future in which everything has been sacrificed, Brave New World is about a man who knows about Earth's past, but the people created by bottles are ignorant of the world. The people are made to repeat a cycle over and over without knowing any reason for life. In savage reservations, where people live in the past, like we do today, one	positive
title: kmtcpp [SEP] content: I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his "bad ones" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the "stuttgart aria" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion.	positive
title: Very funny Abbott & Costello comedy [SEP] content: Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are sidewalk photographers who get mixed up with bank robbers and wind up at a ski resort. This film has the famous A & C verbal humor, and plenty of visual comedy, too. Lou's mishaps on a skating rink are amusing, and a frantic chase finale has Lou turning into a giant snowball! The supporting cast features Sheldon Leonard as the criminal mastermind, and fans of '40s music will enjoy vocalist Ginny Simms. If you saw this on TV years ago, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the print quality of this edition. Replicating the original theatrical viewing experience, the tape includes two coming-attractions previews (the first trailer is the only segment boasting less-than-superior quality), and you'll also see a Woody Woodpecker cartoon and a documentary short about exotic birds. A fine show from Universal.	positive
title: Pretty good, for clip art [SEP] content: This book has a good selection of classic tattoo designs, and I would consider it a good value for the price. The artwork is good, not amazing, but certainly adequate. Each design is offered in color and in linework. If you're looking for a good, all-purpose book of flash, and not necessarily a lot of authentic Sailor Jerry stuff, this book (and CD ROM!) is a good choice.	positive
title: A great album and also an awesome reflection of the 70's! [SEP] content: The first time I heard it was when I was 11,my dad had an old LP and I loved it.Agreat addition to any collection if you like Grateful Dead type country-rock. The song Henry is a great reflection of early 70's marijauna laced lifestyle,and Glendale Train tells a wonderful story.	positive
title: A great little radio! [SEP] content: This is the second Sangean DT-180 AM/FM radio I have purchased. I needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. A great little radio that I use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. Long battery life and it picks up the stations I listen to. Very happy with this radio. I suggest buying your own earphones. The ones with this radio are just odd.	positive
title: Sweet! [SEP] content: These things are great!!! Constructed very well, I thought they would be more flimsy but was happily surprised. I foresee many wonderful years of popscicle making. So far I made orange juice pops, chocolate pudding pops, and frozen yogurt pops.......the choices are endless!	positive
title: For the right audience, a good book [SEP] content: There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.	positive
title: Good so far [SEP] content: Good book so far (chapter 7), and has created some pretty good discussion in my men's group. It's relevant and worth your time.	positive
title: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY [SEP] content: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY by WARD,PETER is a brilliant look into the history of planet Earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. Throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. Throughout the book Dr. Ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if Human Beings are not careful. I strongly advice anyone who is remotely interested in Geology or in any sciences to read this book!	positive
title: Who can resist The Saint? [SEP] content: Roger Moore is at his finest in this series. His true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!But seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series "Batman". The stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.If, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then I urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool.	positive
