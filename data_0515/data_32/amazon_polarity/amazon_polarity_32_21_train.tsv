title: *SWEET* [SEP] content: This book is a must have for BSB and Kevin fans!! It is so good! My friends mom even found it very interesting!!!!!	positive
title: Great Book about Civil Affairs [SEP] content: This is as good a Civil Affairs book as is available out there. It covers a Reserve CA unit in Iraq in 2004 and provides good insight to what Civil Affairs does, but has some grammatical errors and editing issues. Good book, overall, but I'd like to see an active unit chronicled both in and out of the Global War on Terror.	positive
title: Smart and gorgeous [SEP] content: This is really a gorgeous watch.The numbers are clear on the white base, and the stain less steel band is dual shaded, which adds to its beauty.Received in very good condition.I bought it for 34 bucks from Amazon.It could be worn on all kinds of occasions and officially as well, displays date too.I bought it as a gift for some one, the price is also good.	positive
title: Better than some reviews give it credit for [SEP] content: I have the seond edition of Learning Perl and find that this book is not only far more accessible, but covers things that are useful for beginners that Learning Perl does not. The DBI for instance.At the price this title is going for used it is a bargain.	positive
title: Umlaut Heaven [SEP] content: This DVD blew my head off. Could someone help me find it so I can listen to Blue Oyster Cult again?	positive
title: SEXY IS BACK!!! [SEP] content: LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR JUSTIN'S SOPHMORE ALBUM. MY FAVES ARE #7 AND #12.	positive
title: music for the millenium [SEP] content: As the millenium approaches, music must prepare itself for the inevitable change of the ages. And with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track "If I Could", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender "Heaven Only Knows" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful "Beyond Life" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], "Dreaming in Colors", and the African chant-anthem "Uneasy Street". Then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled "One Voice", and the seductive stirrings of "When She Comes". This is an absolute must!	positive
title: Amazingly good for the price [SEP] content: Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Christian Castro Vol. 2 - Karaoke CDG Songlist: [SEP] content: Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Cuando Me Miras Asi2. Con Ella3. Despues De Ti Que4. Lloran Las Rosas5. Lloviendo Estrellas6. Lo Mejor De Mi7. Manana Manana8. Si Tu Me Amaras	positive
title: A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story [SEP] content: Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the "commercial" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.	positive
title: a 40 watt light bulb works [SEP] content: I don't own a Zeno, but I read about the idea of heat treating cystic acne thanks to Zeno. It does work, but there's no need to spend $185. A 40 or 60 Watt light bulb in a lamp does the trick. Turn the lamp on, take the lampshade off, and hold the bulb against the zit for a couple minutes. Briefly switch the lamp off if it gets too hot.	positive
title: Great house for any insect [SEP] content: This is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.	positive
title: THE Best made american horror film [SEP] content: In the first 5 minutes of this film you see a man cut open this chicks stomach, fill it with acid, and slit his own throat. Great Beginning, Great Ending. Fans of Dario Argento, George A. Romero, And Lamberto Bava will not be dissapointed!	positive

title: Works Great [SEP] content: This is a much better alternative to the suction cup mount that came with my GPS. Just place it on your dash and it stays in place perfectly.	positive
title: So Funny [SEP] content: Chris Tucker at his best, no question. One of my favorite movies of all time. Recomend to anyone who has a sense of humor	positive
title: mind blowing! [SEP] content: I love the way Ellen Hopkins portrays the story through prose form. I caught myself reading "Crank" at lightning fast speeds because of how capturing her writing is. With writing in prose forms it offered me a new way of reading a book and having to learn how to read a book written this way. It was refreshing and daring. "Crank" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: Fantastic Textbook [SEP] content: I used this book to teach myself Scheme. It used to be offered at MIT as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 Python. Scheme is very much the "Latin" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. Highly encouraged.	positive
title: Love this DVD [SEP] content: This is an excellent DVD. I love it because it teaches while girls can be little princesses, they can still do things for themselves. My little girl loves it and I highly recommend it!	positive
title: foldable table [SEP] content: It's just the item I was looking for. I used the table for art shows to display my wares.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: Ramshackled Still Sounds GREAT [SEP] content: I bought this LP back in '77 and was blown away by the versatile drumming of Alan White. Every track has a different feel. I had to add this CD to my collection of growing YES CDs to replace old LPs. This is one of my favorits...	positive
title: This guy can sing! [SEP] content: Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!	positive
title: 3-6 is cool [SEP] content: Hey man, I read your review and I would have to agree with you on the wicked part. It seems that they don't know what to come up with now. For example, Choices 2, it was good but not as good as thier other stuff like Choices 1. It feels like they lost the feeling for music that they had before like "When the Smoke Clears," that was a cool CD. Hey, you know what happend to La Chat, Murder She Spoke was a kick @ss CD.	positive
title: Pre-Ordered [SEP] content: Not received yet, but have the first two seasons. Love the acting and the way the actors all fit together and seem like a real family. Tom Selleck is always great but really shines in this one. Really looking forward to receiving this and hope it will continue for many years.	positive
title: Lots of action [SEP] content: Great book if you like action stories. Complex, well-developed characters. Intriguing plot. Four sets of villains, sometimes hard to keep track of who's who, especially everybody is not what the seem. Long discourses on Bible history sometimes interrupts action at inappropriate times. Cotton Malone is a wonderfully developed character and I will read additional Steven Berry books with this character.	positive
title: Fabulous shoes [SEP] content: I wore these as a bridesmaid in a wedding and was prepared to change early in the reception, but they were much more comfortable than I expected. I bought a half size larger than I normally wear. I got tons of compliments.	positive
title: Alla Rakha was peerless and still is [SEP] content: What a slice of nirvana from 1968 [recorded in 1967, I believe]! For fans of Rich, I am not sure what the appeal would be, but for Alla Rakha devotees, this is one CD you cannot live without.The packaging is simple, but faithful to the original LP's artwork. All the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. You feel like the musicians are in the room-and I don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. Five Stars on this one.	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Excellent Book !!! [SEP] content: I just finished reading this book. I must say, that as a PC tech , this book is one of the best I've come across. Carey has made it easy for the casual user to understand how to take care of their own computer and fix simple problems. It's written in simple to understand language that anyone can follow. This book is also a valuable reference for even experienced technicians.I will be recommending this book as a must have for all of my customers. Thanks to Carey for bringing a book like this to the masses.	positive
title: One of the worst books I ever read [SEP] content: I didn't like the plot because it seemed very unrealistic. There was way too much graphic sex that didn't add to the character development. It wasn't engaging to me at all. Maybe I just didn't like any of the characters in the book.	negative
title: Theif Lord...I was rather Bored... by artemis11 [SEP] content: It was an OK book, if you like books where 5 years olds become aspiring thieves =(. Well anyway I better review it:The book starts when a wealthy lady come to Victor a Private Investigatior with a request to find her nephews. He accepts and eventally finds them, and begins to like them yada yada yada....You know what happens...They escape with the help of their friends...Everything turns out for the better...Typical Pre-Teen book...A review by artemis11	negative
title: Save your money [SEP] content: Transmitter is too weak. Transmission can be easily overcome by transmitters in vehicles passing by.Ugly long antenna line.Went out and bought a Griffin transmitter which has much more power.	negative
title: Not great [SEP] content: This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead.	negative
title: Wouldn't recommend it [SEP] content: Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product.	negative
title: Worked for 30 minutes [SEP] content: Worked for about the first 30 minutes, and then stopped working. At first I thought it was my laptop or my TV but after testing this cable with several TV's it's definately the cable.	negative
title: Carman: Beyond 1st Amendment Protection [SEP] content: Freedom of speech is an idea very dear to my heart. However, I find Carman's facist messages alarming, to say the least. I believe that Carman's message is so dangerous that it is not protected by the First Amendment. In fact, in postulating this message of a violent overthrow of the government by Christian Marxists, Carman is guilty of not only poor judgement, but treason. For this act of sedition he should be tried and subsequently hanged.	negative
title: It is ok but [SEP] content: I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with. It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that. I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model. This one is just not nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one. I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.	negative
title: No new information and poorly compiled [SEP] content: This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject.	negative
title: GT Interactive, too OLD for windows XP [SEP] content: doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs "Just Me & My Dad" and "Just Me & My Grandpa". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played.	negative
title: Great series but surprises ruined [SEP] content: The order in which everyone gets voted out is on each disc you pull out. How dumb is that?Otherwise it's a fun season which is why I bought it. I will probably never find the time to watch the commentaries.	negative
title: Great... until it died [SEP] content: I liked the toaster up until it gasped its last breath. It had great features like "keep warm". But it dies after only a year and a half of use. Too expensive (and big) to be disposable!	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Way Out Of Date [SEP] content: This little book needs to go away. The version of GIMP that it describes is long gone and not missed. The contents is nearly all useless, and there are so many better books on GIMP available.	negative
title: Terrible [SEP] content: This DVD just copied different pieces from many different sources on TV or Movies. They hired someone to talk about all those gossips. I wish I could get refund for this kind of DVD.If you have nothing to do and have too much money, buy it to kill some time and money.	negative
title: Save your Money [SEP] content: This pump could NOT pump warm cooking oil out of the pan. I gave up and went to the hardware store and purchased a large funnel with a filter. In my opinion, it is a piece of junk.	negative
title: Not true to size [SEP] content: I had to return the item because it was not true to size. There was no way, that this item was the size it was marked. I ordered an extra wide shoe, and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them, without them being loose on her. I wasnt happy at all.	negative
title: Christmas Nightmare with Vince Vaughn [SEP] content: My Title says it all. My Wife and I sat down to watch a Christmas movie together and decided to rent this.I wish I could get my 1hr and 29 mins back. This movie is bad, only reason I gave it 2 stars was Reese Witherspoon.Vaughn still can't act his way out of a paper bag and the rest of the cast was painful to watch. If you want a funnyChristmas movie to rent on Amazon check out Surviving Christmas with Ben Affleck.	negative
title: Avoid this brand! [SEP] content: I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand.	negative
title: Proves the theory... [SEP] content: Great sidemen don't always make great composers. Jan Garbarek is a brilliant contemporary saxophonist. His body of work playing with the likes of Keith Jarrett, Charlie Haden, Ralph Towner, Art Lande and other ECM artists is simply stunning.But "Visible World" can only be described as a collection of banal Kenny G. new-age cliches. What happened? Perhaps Jan wanted to go after some of that big Kenny G. cash? Or maybe, absent the collaboration of other great musicians, Garbarek's creativity left him? Either way, this CD is beneath him, certainly not a reflection of his prodigious talent. Skip this, and instead savor some of his most amazing work on Keith Jarrett's "Personal Mountains".	negative
title: Good looks ain`t everything [SEP] content: It's a very nice looking coffee machine, but it always leaves a mess. The filter pops open while the coffee is still brewing, it over floats quite often and you end up with a lot of coffee grinds in your coffee	negative
title: Ja-Blah! [SEP] content: When i first bought into bluetooth fone technology i was sold but beware there are drawbacks! First the Ja-Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth. Connectivity! it is there. it seems to do the basic stuff ok....but when you demand more from it like crystal clear calls or reception away from phone...look for another earpeice! this device gets static @ 5 or more ft...the echoes you get are nothing short of what past reviewers say about it..when u buy a product you want it to work @ least 90% of time not 70%..Always remember to do you homework when buying these devices b/c they are expensive(cost as much as many cell phones!)...buy earpices from companies who actually make cell phones(motorola for example)..they tend to understand the "reception game" a little better....happy hunting!	negative
title: DISLIKE THIS UNIT [SEP] content: TIE THIS THING DOWN. IT VIBRATES THE WHOLE COUNTER,MAKES NOISE WHILE MIXING, NEEDS LIGHT IN DISPLAY WINDOW.IN MY OPINION NOT A GOOD BUY AT ALL	negative
title: Stopped working in a year [SEP] content: This router was good for a year but stopped working after that. Not worth it for the money I spent.	negative
title: HORRIBLE! [SEP] content: Don't waste your time. It is a waste of paper. The only thing the book has going for it is that the "action" never stops. The "action" is also unbelievable. A fair plot ruined and gone terribly bad.	negative
title: Enough already [SEP] content: Haven't we overdosed on semiotics taken to its idiotic extreme? Do throw rugs and hardwood floors really "say" that much about us? Can you tell how daring we are simply by the number of knick-knacks we own? This book is forensic jive from self-appointed experts whose only real concern is whether or not their tastes conform to the latest Interview fad.	negative
title: THIS IS SO[ Awful]!!! [SEP] content: This is an awful movie. There is only one good jolt in the whole thing, but other than that this isn't scary at all. Just a long boring piece of cinema. The re-make was better, and the re-make was awful as well. Don't see it alone in the dark, because you'll need someone to wake you up!	negative
title: was not pleased [SEP] content: Had to redrill holes wood cracked just was not pleased with it but already put it together i will go ahead and keep it is not worth the price i payed for it.	negative
title: Please enter a title for your review [SEP] content: although i like bill maher's talk show i've always found his opening monologues painfully amateurish and unfunny so i don't know what possessed me to check out this one hour stand-up set but it's firmly set him in my mind as the worst stand-up comedian i've ever endured. his Bush bashing and otherwise cliched sentiments have never been less cleverly expressed.	negative
title: Lots of unrealized potential [SEP] content: I bought this thinking I'd like it a lot. Every review I read made it sound like the type of music I'd like to own, esp. the idea that this was groundbreaking genre bending man-machine melding music. The clips sounded good too. Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed. Moby takes some good ideas and goes nowhere with them.	negative
title: So so aweful [SEP] content: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.	negative
title: An okay gift... [SEP] content: I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose...	negative
