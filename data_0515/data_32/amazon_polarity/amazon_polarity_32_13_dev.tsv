title: Future of Metal, What a joke [SEP] content: These guys are terrible, theyre decent musicians but that doesnt make them a good bandthey are pretty much a second rate metallica clone with some of the worst vocals evermetallcore is becoming the new, nu-metal	negative
title: Each book just gets worse... [SEP] content: I remember the "good old days" when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!	negative
title: Huge letdown [SEP] content: I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent "uplifting" family film, opt for "The Sandlot."	negative
title: Glad the hype is OVER! [SEP] content: This CD is ok but doesn't draw much attention - especially after the nauseating overkill exposure it received. Hasn't anyone ever heard mindless pop before? However, "Puffy Little Shoes" is both pixilated and intriguing, a recherche moue of a tiny tune. But let's just say "enough" to the Michael Jacksons of Seattle music, ok? Thank you.	negative
title: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT [SEP] content: I should have heeded the warnings of reviews on previous versions of this movie. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations for this compilation. Whatever the reason was, I felt a little "let down" when i finally viewed this DVD. I have been wanting to see one of these movies for about 15 years now since they started the tour. I was intrigued by the name "sick and twisted animation" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an "official grown-up" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats. If you like a guy named Bill Plympton, then maybe you will like this as several of the sketches are from him, otherwise I have to give this a big thuymbs down.	negative
title: Dreadful [SEP] content: Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, and so on, and so on, and so on...Put in some nice special effects and support it with booming sound and you have the so-called "masterpiece" LOTR.	negative
title: Liked their original formula better [SEP] content: I had been using their original cleaner premixed in the little plastic jars and loved it for years so I ordered several of these little packets for my daughter and I. It is not the same. It cleans well, but the formula gets very thick and gel-like very fast with thick clumps so that you have to add hot water. I used a brand new container just once on diamond studs and then two weeks later went to use it again, and it was all thick and cloudy and gross looking.	negative
title: Sadly Not Well Made. [SEP] content: I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though.	negative
title: This book is a piece of... [SEP] content: You will not know what I mean untill you buy and use this book. It is not meant for first semester students as the review mentioned. It sucks...examples are so hard, and approach used in the book in so difficult to understand	negative
title: I resent what this implies! [SEP] content: Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected "just for me?" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway.	negative
title: Will not work on PS3!!!! [SEP] content: I was really disappointed to find out that this edition of the film will not work on the ps3. Being that the PS3 is the only blu-ray player I own, this movie was unwatchable for me.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: For $5.oo don't expect good quality. My 4 yo liked it but got tired of it. It has 3 voice settings which pretty much sounded the same to me.The only thing I like about this product is that it's size is perfect for my 4yo son. Not really a good bday present ..but could be a good bday party treat.	negative
title: "I felt like I was visiting Milwaukee, my hometown." [SEP] content: I enjoyed reading the descriptions of Milwaukee flavored by a bit of history. I especially appreciated the dining spots of Milwaukee. It brought back many memories. Since I am an old Nancy Drew fan, I felt Beth was Nancy as a mature detective.	negative
title: It's all about the PICTURES!!! [SEP] content: I love this book because of it's pictures. It demonstrates which primary and secondary muscles are being workied during various exercises, which is pretty neat. Other than that, it isn't very useful. It doesn't provide good routines or workouts that best develop those very areas it demonstrates. Thus, it's not a good workout book, just a nice reference. It's nice to have, but not necessary. Buy it if you like pictures, but don't waste the money if you can only afford one book.	negative
title: never seems to completely absorb [SEP] content: After buying the day and night creams, I was terribly disappointed.I hated the feel of this cream/serum. Maybe I'm using it wrong; everybody else seems to like it. I tried it for two weeks, and after it finally dried it left a sticky, filmy layer on my skin.I have combination skin, and am in my 50's, I didn't expect a miracle, but it never seemed to completely absorb. Wasted my money!	negative
title: nice nail clippers... [SEP] content: the only thing that I use is the nail clippers, and because it has the white attachment is easy to find. My child has never take or will ever take any kind of medication so the spoon and the dropper are compleatly useless. The nose thing is too small and the thermometer I have never use it since she has never being sick.	negative
title: I HATE IT, WORTHLESS PLUG [SEP] content: I REGRET SPENDING 7.00 DOLLARS BUYING THIS PLUG FROM WAL-MART. I DIDN'T NEED A NEW PLUG, MY 128L HUSQVARNA WEED TRIMMER WAS WORKING JUST FINE. HOWEVER AFTER READING THE PACKAGING I THOUGHT HUMM, MAYBE I WILL SWITCH MY RCJ8Y CHAMP..PLUG OUT WITH THIS E3.12 SPARK PLUG. WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE WITH THIS NEW E3.12 PLUG I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND REINSTALL THE OLD PLUG. (RCJ8Y)SPARK PLUG. TO FINISH THE JOB. THE NEXT DAY I DECIDED BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW I WOULD GIVE THE E3.12 SPARK PLUG A SECOND CHANCE. WELL, THE OUT COME WAS THE SAME, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE MY 128L WEED TRIMMER WOULD CUT OFF AS IF IT WAS CHOKED OFF. THEN WOULD NOT RESTART. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WILL ADVISE ALL FRIENDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SPARK PLUG.IT IS POSSIBLE I HAVE A FACTORY DEFECTIVE PLUG BUT....IM NOT SPENDING THE MONEY TO TRY A SECOND ONE. I SEE SOME PEOPLE HAS WROTE GOOD REVIEWS, I AM NOT KNOCKING THEIR STORIES.	negative
title: Blah! What is this?! [SEP] content: If their is one CD I don't like in this world, this is it! The lyrics are poor and the songs are just plain annoying!! They can't sing at all and it's all I hear on the radio! Avoid it!	negative
title: WAY too big [SEP] content: The way this apron is cut, it totally falls off of my 4 year old. I can't imagine this working for any kid under the age of 10.	negative
title: Knock-off book printed in black & white on low grade paper. [SEP] content: My rating refers to the quality of the item delivered, not the content of the textbook itself, read on for details.I ordered this book through Amazon.com, LLC hoping to avoid the many low quality counterfeit textbooks shipped by many third party sellers. When I opened the box, the packing slip said "Principles of Fluid Mechanics, [Hardcover]" but the textbook was just what I wanted to avoid. The cover was flimsy paper, the entire content of the textbook was printed in black and white on what looked like extremely cheap recycled paper.I thought it had to be an error, so I called Amazon and requested an exchange. Lo and behold, the replacement item was the exact same low quality item. I ended up paying $50 LESS to get an actual hardcover from a third party seller on the site. I hope Amazon.com, LLC will look into their supplier and fix the issue soon. Until then, they are charging $150 for a product that is NOT as described.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS EVER [SEP] content: This is a complete waste of money; the thing just does not work at all. The software is good but I could not get my computer to recognize the drive. The bottom line - buy something else	negative
title: What is this? [SEP] content: What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying "we're trying new ways", "this is our best album so far", "we do what gives us pleasure". One only needs to compare it with "Moving Picture", "Permanent Waves" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!	negative
title: How's Reverend Moon Doing? [SEP] content: Rev. Moon, the guy the republicans don't want you to know about is the man "With The Plan" according to Poppy Bush- maybe his divine guidance helped shape Dumbya's economic miracle. Afterall, Moon says he's the REAL messiah! What else could explain the oceans of lies spun out by the winger think tanks and reported as gospel truth if divine intervention isn't involved? Find out more- google "Moon Primer".	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: just don't [SEP] content: the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)	negative
title: I didn't like it at all [SEP] content: I'm not really anti Bill Phillips like some other reviewers and I don't know his history. I bought this book, followed the technique to a key and felt worse after. I have a feeling it was the supplements because I never had such headaches just from working out, and I've been working out for years. Somethings I did find annoying like the "late night infomercial" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times. I will give credit to Mr. Phillips ability to motivate people but I'm not convinced Anthony Robbins won't do a better job for you.	negative
title: Not Enough Depth [SEP] content: This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.	negative
title: Still Waiting... [SEP] content: I ordered this in the middle of March. If it takes much longer, it will miss the whole Spring season... Sure would be nice to have what I paid for. What in the world takes so long to mail a magazine?	negative
title: A way to get started (and frustrated) with a TabletPC [SEP] content: I've had my machine for almost a year now. It has gone back for trackpad problems once. In addition the CMOS battery was replaced, the case was cracking and it was replaced as well. It was fixed in a timely manner, but it is now doing the same thing. The machine is noisy, hot and the battery life is horrible. I bought it as a cheap way to get into a tablet. I'm convinced of the value of having a tablet; I just need to get a better tablet. If you get one, get an extended warranty.	negative
title: You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed [SEP] content: This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is "standard" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% "standard" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet.	negative
title: Not literature [SEP] content: Red this book at the request of a colleague. I can see why he liked it, simplistic solutions for very complicated problems, much like ... Well then, a quick read, nothing complicated here, and an alright story but fails a deep understanding and complexity of societies problems. Read the history of places where prisoners have been dumped, e.g. Georgia & Australia, and as Paul Harvey says, "Here is the rest of the story."	negative
title: Amityville 3(3D) [SEP] content: My beef isn't with it not being "3D" but with how boring and awful it is,the only spooks you get is scattered, You got this guy who is a "Skeptic" well needless to say so much for him being a skeptic and gets what he deserves for being so dumb,naive and stubborn or "skeptic". (In the movie of course), Lori Loughlin(Full House), An ever Annoying as Always Meg Ryan(Why couldn't she die in the movie?) and apparently a hot well/fountain in the basement. You want scares Try part 1 with Uber-Liberal Pansy and Stressiand Bum James Brolin and Part 2 With Burt Young(Convoy,Pig Pen) all the other movies after really are a disservice.	negative
title: Excellent!! [SEP] content: I just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!Without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly Chinese speaking. But this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]This film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. You come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!	positive
title: 5-Star Road to Optimal Health [SEP] content: Natalia Rose so gets it right with her waste equals weight concept. I wish everyone would read her book! I've been following her basic principles for 6 months and have watched my skin clear up, my weight drop, my mood lifted and my general energy level doubled. The way to this cleansing from the inside out is simply but thoroughly laid out in her book with recipes to keep you creative as you're cleansing. I don't believe in "diets". I never have. This book, however, is a way of and road map to filling our bodies with real, raw, unprocessed food and finding our purest and leanest selves. The writing is thoughtful, the principles are astute and easy to grasp, and there is something for everyone to find and follow in this book that will lead us to healthier living period. Brava, Natalia Rose!	positive
title: Absolutely amazing mini series [SEP] content: This is one of my all time favorite books, so I was skeptical that the movie would be as good, but was pleasantly surprised at how closely they followed the book. It is an amazing mini series, extremely well made and the characters were true to the book. I would recommend this mini series to any Ken Follett fan or anyone who loves Pillars of the Earth.	positive
title: Very Satisfied [SEP] content: So sharp she cut her finger twice while peeling a potato. Worth the purchase and I would buy more of these items	positive
title: Senior Exercise DVD [SEP] content: Came timely and in expected condition. (Can't review product itself; haven't been able to try it outyet.)	positive
title: Works as advertised [SEP] content: I work in a warehouse loading heavy packages into trailer trucks. I've been having some pain in my wrists and I could no longer do push ups due to the pain. I've been using these wrist wraps for a few weeks and they have limited movement of my wrists so they don't hurt as much. My only complaints are 1) I wish they came in black because I work in a pretty dirty environment and 2) they are somewhat bulky	positive
title: Classic Book for Baby [SEP] content: This Golden Book will bring back memories and give new ones for your little one. I think the story has a great message and needs to be taught to those little children as they are growing.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Classy, Nothin' Cheap about it [SEP] content: Ive been using this since 2006, girls routinely tell me i smell good.The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you're on the move. 5 stars	positive
title: Rockin! [SEP] content: If you've never heard of Scott Miller, BUY THIS CD! He's a talented songwriter and a lot of fun to listen to. Scott's style of music defies conventional descriptions. Rock? Yes. Country? Yes. Bluegrass? Yes. Gospel? Sometimes. Whatever you call it, you're gonna love it!If you already love Scott Miller but don't yet own this, BUY THIS CD! It's the second best thing to actually being at one of his live performances.	positive
title: Why Weight no longer!! [SEP] content: This is a study guide that has had great impact on me and the other three women in our group. Geneen really helps us to realize the true reason for our overeating and her lessons are great to do alone or with the group. Very impacting study guide and program. Highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with their weight loss.	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Good stuff. [SEP] content: This one surprised me. It was better than I thought it was going to be. It's filled with good simple, some practical, things you can do to keep whatever control you have left over your whereabouts and personal information.	positive
title: Celtic bracelets [SEP] content: I bought these for Cheer Leaders that cheer for the CELTICS,,,they are very well made, wonderful quality, and shipment was quick.	positive
title: Better Than The Movie [SEP] content: Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category.	positive
title: view of someone raised in Islam [SEP] content: As one raised in Islam, I truly wish more Christians would write books like these that would help break down the barrier between Muslims and Christians.	positive
title: Thanks Again Vickie [SEP] content: Just as wonderful as Vickie's Pregnancy book. A must have for the first few weeks back from the hospital when you're unsure of EVERYTHING. Thanks again Vickie.	positive
title: Entertaining with plenty of twists as always. [SEP] content: Any issue of Shanda is going to be great with mastermind Mike Curtis at the helm. We discover Terri has a brother, who inexplicably shows up on Shanda's doorstep, and troubled feelings ensue when Terri tries to defend him and herself against their own family. Heartwarming comic book in the end and worth picking up.	positive
title: More Ruby please [SEP] content: I figured out who the killer was early on but it didnt spoil the story. I really like China Bayles. She is cool. However if I could talk to Ms Albert I would ask her to please include more of the Ruby character and ease back on the Sheila!! I think Ruby rocks!! But I liked this book and I like this series. The herb info is cool too. I am reading these in order so I have a few more to go. I have enjoyed them all.	positive
title: The most usefull and powerfull book for 3dsmax ever [SEP] content: since the dawn of maxscript there has little of no help for its aplication thus resulting in its use rating less than a chocolate firegaurd. But stop! now there is a book for us all, from beginner to advanced it teaches and informs in a clear and conciese language that at defies incomprehention. You are presented with over a dozen chapters tackling most areas of maxscript with cd content to back them up. The biggest secret of 3dsMax is its scripting language and the affect it WILL have of your day to day workflow, this book pulls the cat out of the bag by it's tail and swing it around like a weapon. 80)	positive
title: Quick read world news [SEP] content: I purchased the Economist as a supplement to more expensive financial investment news services online. I had read special editions purchased at news stand prices, and found it almost too much to read in a week. The regular weekly edition is well organized, with capsule summaries of events up front, and longer feature articles on the same subjects further back.The British and European news and political bias is different than what we get on CNBC, Investors Business Daily, and USA Today. Many of the writers are very good, but the usual lack of credibility stands out in some others.	positive
title: Awesome cd. [SEP] content: This cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. From beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. The lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars	positive
title: subtle, comical, and enlightening [SEP] content: I was sitting at Starbucks on a Saturday afternoon, when a very nice girl overheard my guffaw about reading another one of Bush's intelligent statements, "I didn't know the camera was on me!"So we began to talk, and after a few minutes, she pulled this book out of her bag, and told me that I should read it.All weekend long I did read, and I could not put it down. Intense, exciting, exhilerating, comical, a rush of relief in knowing that the end of the world could be an amazing wonderful experience.This book is everything, philosophical, sociological, psychological, comical, dramatic, and your not-so-common, "it just made me laugh at loud and feel good" type of book.My advice?I highly recommend this book, and periodically hanging out in coffee shops to meet really neat people!	positive
title: I hate Paladin's but I love this Book! [SEP] content: This book was so wonderful I almost had a heart attack after I read it. I mean I hate paladin's but the book was so well written It helped me get the few arrogent players who played them into line quick by helping me tighten the reins a little on exactly what Paladin's should and should not be doing.	positive
title: Right on target yet someting missing [SEP] content: The book had been in the making at Stanford for some time. I happened to use a manuscript of it in 1991 at Virginia Tech. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity. The book surely makes a useful companion to a plasticity textbook.It is disheartening to see that the numerical schemes for the integration of the constitutive equations of the endochronic theory are missing from the book.	positive
title: Love this book!! [SEP] content: Amazing book! I've read this to my children and give this book as gifts! It's a wonderful gift to give!!	positive
title: It really works [SEP] content: I bought the air revitalizer because I have dogs and a cat and I didn't want my house to smell like I have dogs and cats! When I bought it, I lived in a one story house. It worked great. (The only scent I've used is vanilla.) I don't think the sound is too loud, but I lived in a large house. When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. I placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. I am impressed and very glad that I have it.	positive
title: Loved It! [SEP] content: What a good book! It is the story of a medival man turned into a vampire. The book is set in the modern world, but flashes back to the time of King Arthur. I don't want to spoil the story for those who have not read it. Suffice it to say that the main characters are realistic and genuine. The story is entertaining with a lot of action. It is a fun read and the writing style is excellent. I hope these authors collaborate on more books in the future. Richard, the main character, is apparently modeled after the LaCroix character Nigel Bennett played on Forever Knight. This book is a must read for Forever Night fans as well as those people who like vampires, but hate the ultra-gorgeous Anne Rice kind.	positive
title: Our client's favorite [SEP] content: We refer our clients with questions on spreads to this book. Most say it's their favorite because it relies on clear, non-technical language. This book is appropriate regardless of the individuals level of understanding.	positive
title: New in Town [SEP] content: Great comedy and romance. Renee and Harry have good chemistry! Hometown kind of movie. Funny situations and good old fashion humor! Spectacular picture quality. Blu Ray rocks!	positive
title: The Big Country Restored/Preserved & in Blu-ray Format [SEP] content: At the film's conclusion, the follwing message appears: "The Big Country (1958) Restored by the Academy Film Archive with funding provided by the Film Foundation and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences." However, no additional information regarding the restoration process is provided. A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, "completely photochemical" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same. Regardless, this Blu-ray format presentation of The Big Country is a pleasure to view and I will not fault this Technirama gem-of-a-film. The transfer is very good.

title: Best out there [SEP] content: It works great. It's very light, weighs like 1 pound. One of my fans were at first stuck but I unjammed it with a pencil and its now running smoothly. Highly recommend.Only con is that when you plug it in the blue LED light is very bright.	positive
