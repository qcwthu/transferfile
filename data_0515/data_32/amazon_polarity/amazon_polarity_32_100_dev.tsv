title: The title is an oxymoron, but they did a good job of making it simple [SEP] content: I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book.	positive
title: Incredible value not to be missed [SEP] content: This book is full of priceless information about places you would otherwise never hear about. It is not to be missed.	positive
title: Great movie! [SEP] content: This is the epitome of a "B" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!	positive
title: oh my gosh [SEP] content: phenominal game. like the other guy, i am about 21 percent through the game but i found the chase exhilerating, like no other in any game. the blurryness is from your panic and if you do well, you won't be very blurry but if you keep looking at the guys breaking down doors that you lock behind you, or get shot a couple times, it goes downhill fast, but that is what makes it so intense. i wish they made more games like this where you actually do things and flesh out the story before going in guns blazing (like half life 1). overall one of a kind game and actually pretty scary and intene. I don't even find games like resident evil or silent hill 2 to be scary or intense like this. hell of a game with great graphics on my 360 and great surround sound with an enthralling storyline and detailed world. very good for a mature gamer who has other games like devil may cry and halo to satisfy my bloodlust.	positive
title: Lost and Found [SEP] content: For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did.	positive
title: Great STORY + Great ACTING = GREAT MOVIE ! ! ! [SEP] content: "THE MAJESTIC"Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Very tight acting and very believable characters. It's easy to care for them and want what they want. Jim Carrey is fantastic, too. He can really bring a tear to the eye when he wants to. He does a SUPERB JOB and I am impressed. I didn't know Ace Ventura had it in him.If you like movies that are meaningful and thought pervoking then I highly recommend 'The Majestic'. Taking a serious movie in, now and then, helps to keep life into perspective. GREAT MOVIE!!!	positive
title: Great product I have used for years [SEP] content: If you are looking for a good product at a great price, this is it. I have used this ointment for years and have had no problems with skin breakdown. Great protection for anyone with irritating skin problems. Helps protect against diaper rash and more. Highly recommended by my doctor to me. Buying this in the one-pound jar is also more economical.	positive
title: Andy Williams at his best [SEP] content: These two albums are a collection of lesser known Andy Williams songs that are masterfully mixed and interwoven. The entire series of songs related to If Wishes Were Horses and the sense of living in the moment, using a New Christy Minstrals hit song, brings back wonderful memories and provides a provocative listening experience, as well as being a window into the personal challenges and emotions of the artist at that time.	positive
title: nice [SEP] content: Mine came defective but belkin replaced it after i had to return it at my expense. the new one is working fine just don't know if it is helping.	positive
title: Blossom47 is now happy. [SEP] content: With a love list I put some one on it:Sara,Jessica,Ruby,Kandra(A little.)Jessica,too.Also a H8 One:Punkstar,(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOUR A GOTH).So Your on the love list ,Becuz you rock,Angel's gettin' on the love list!Love Blossom47!	positive
title: A monster of a book. [SEP] content: Rambling, discursive, entertaining informative and highly individual. With particular reference to eastern Europe and Orthodoxy. Norman is a eastern European specialist and so balances up the usual highly Western European, Catholic/Protestant bias found in histories of this sort.	positive
title: Kept my attention! [SEP] content: I started reading this book while walking on the treadmill.. I normally hate doing cardio because i get so bored and cant seem to get in the grove. I enjoyed this book so much that i looked forward to doing cardio, just so i could simply read. It kept my attention, and kept me wanting more.. Its very different from Nicholas Sparks other books in that it does have mystery and intense parts!	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Delightful story with wonderful ensemble of actors [SEP] content: This story of a poor British girl with limited means and a big imagination is one of my favorite movies, and always leaves a smile on my face (and maybe a few tears in my eyes, too.). The cast is absolutely dreamy, including Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea, John Lithgow, the hilarious Kevin Kline, and the beautiful Phoebe Cates as the "Princess". Anyone who loves "period" pieces will love this film. (It is now being shown on the "Romance" cable TV channel, too.)	positive
title: I love this gadget [SEP] content: I maintain 4400 sq ft of wood floors and I own 1 of these. I am buying 3 more to place inconspicuously around my living areas. I like to sweep to touch up high traffic areas like the entry and kitchen. It makes things more convienent.	positive
title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: Beautiful photos . Good information [SEP] content: Very beautiful and relaxing photos . Good articles with parties rules and settings of different festivals and with different person . Good DIY little projects . Very useful appendix with some flowers introduction, teaching of napkin floding etc. A good bookfor when you want to plan parties. But sometimes quite dull.	positive
title: These things work! [SEP] content: I am a serious walker. I have walked 10 miles virtually every day, except Sundays, for over eight years. I figure that I have walked over 25,000 miles during this time. I am 68 years old. An article about exercise and longevity at The New England Journal of Medicine got me started on such an endeavor. Plantar Fascitis (heel pain) has bothered me quite a bit lately. So much so, that I have been contemplating cutting back on my walking. Today, I received my order of these heel protectors. I put one on my left heel and I received immediate pain relief. I will keep you posted on how they work over longer term.	positive
title: The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street Lives On Today..Serendipity [SEP] content: A fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing. Penpals of sorts. A must read for anyone, but writers it can tear down any writers block you could possibly have. She is so articulate and real. I highly suggest this book!	positive
title: Wonderful masterpiece.... [SEP] content: The best movie chronicling the life of a composer I have seen to date. Except, the storyline involving Salieri's connection to Mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so. Tom Hulce as Mozart gives a breathtaking performance. He becomes the character. I loved his crazy laugh! This is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me.	positive
title: Very enjoyable and fun movie [SEP] content: I really enjoyed this movie. I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it "Gone with the Wind" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.	positive
title: Best of the Bunch [SEP] content: Let's get something straight right now:The intelligentsia loves Empire Strikes Back. They say it's because Empire is one of the only blockbuster movies that actually has a downer ending in which the bad guys win. They enjoy being contrarian. They're deluded.The romantics love Return of the Jedi. They get all teary-eyed at the funeral pyre scene when Anakin Skywalker appears in his non-Darth Vader form at the end. They are simpering sentimental fools.Only degenerates love Episodes I thru III. They need counseling.The original Star Wars is without a doubt the BEST of the series. None of the other films come close. The good thing about this particular package is that Disc 2 contains the ACTUAL original, not the bogus "enhanced" Star Wars with the silly new graphics, symbols in themselves of all sorts of late-life regrets and insecurities on Lucas's part. No, Disc 2 contains the real deal. The best of the bunch, unsullied and unsurpassed.	positive
title: Good Show History [SEP] content: I have watched the show since 1956. It was fun to read about the show over the years.	positive
title: Gets an absolute beginner up and running. [SEP] content: This book is aimed at those who are completely new to Access. It will systematically, for the most part, allow a beginner to become familiar with Tables, Forms, Queries,etc... Good examples, CD contains video examples as well. If your new to Access and want to be held by the hand then buy this book.	positive
title: perfect [SEP] content: this coffee maker travels with me everywhere. it is well made and the extra shot a great hidden gem. buy it!	positive
title: Reply To Music Man from the UK or something along that line [SEP] content: the song they sing on the bus is "tiny dancer" by elton john where they all start joining in, hope this helped you	positive
title: A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl [SEP] content: This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play.	positive
title: Wonderful Storytelling! [SEP] content: Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books. After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series. I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters. I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!	positive
title: Beautiful Picture [SEP] content: I have been looking for this blu-ray for my husband for some time. It hasn't been in any store I have looked and every else online had outrageous prices. I am so happy I looked on Amazon before giving up. We popped it in our PS3 and the picture is absolutely phenomenal. I even ended up watching it with him.	positive
title: Do not use a generic battery! [SEP] content: I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 2004, was recommending. Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.	positive
title: Best new Handheld System than Sony's PSP [SEP] content: I think it is cool for Nintendo to make this new Handheld System great for Fans of Nintendo. I mean the Reason why I said this is better than The Playstation Portible (Sony's 1st handheld system) because Sony doesn't know what the heck there making I mean Nintendo made more Games for the DS than Sony because Sony is making a little bit of Games for the PSP but I betcha the DS is going to be better.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: Sorry, not much here for me [SEP] content: I bought it for some insight on troubleshooting my PS2, disk read problems. Not much there, unfortunately. That in it's own self wouldn't be a killer, but the fact that the book is 2/3 "guide to games" cinches the deal. It's from 2001, so there are no games since then included in the guide. If you just bought a PS2 (like I did) and you find this for a buck at a flea market, it might be worth it.	negative
title: Not Impressed [SEP] content: I have never really been fond of Ethics and Moral code to begin with because most of the articles fail to realize the whole point of what they are writing about. This book really wasn't any different. The articles about Abortion are weak and they don't fully explain what their whole point of what they are writing about is. It doesn't help matters when every article in this book is so drawn out. Everything that is said in this book could be done so in about 2 or 3 pages instead it is drawn out to about 10 to 15 pages. The authors are basically repeating themselves over and over throughout the entire article.I personally don't think this would be a great buy but maybe thats because I find all the arguments in moral and ethic philosophies are very weak and not at all to the point.	negative
title: Icorrect Information [SEP] content: None of the songs listed in the below discription are on this CD. Save your money. If you are looking for Polly Browns hits, this is NOT the CD you want.	negative
title: Stick to Celtic Work RJ [SEP] content: Alright book. There are better books on Qaballah out there. I was quite suprised to see this author undertake this book, and disappointed. It seems these days that no one is content to develop a purely celtic magical tradition. Are the european peoples ashamed of their rich spiritual past and potential ? Come on people, there is so much to be discovered out there from our own genetic history without having to goto the middle east, Amer-Indians, Asia, the west Indies or Africa. People should be able to get what they want out of the tradtions they have a birth right to, leaving other peoples birthright traditions for them.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: My husband has been wearing Munsingwear for many, many years. He has noted that each time we purchase them the quality and consistency of fit deteriorates. This last purchase was the final proverbial straw. The leg openings, fly opening and placement, and waist band varied greatly with each pair, so much so that there were some he just couldn't wear at all; they were so uncomfortable. We will not be purchasing Mun singwear again. Ever.	negative
title: Baby Einstein Series [SEP] content: Frankly, for the $$ I was unimpressed. I had heard great things about this series and was sorely disappointed. Each of the presentations seem very "low budget." The filming content did not keep the attention of either my child or my nieces or nephews, ages 6 months to 4 yrs. Next time, I will tape animal/art programs from either Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and play my classical CD's in the back ground. Save your self the $$.	negative
title: Good writing, poor story [SEP] content: Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess.	negative
title: Discontinued Product [SEP] content: Just spoke with Macco Akzo customer service - 800-634-0015 (Manufacturer of Liquid Nails products). This specific product line (DR-807) was discontinued in 2008. Any tubes currently on the market are at least 4 years old...	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: Do Not Buy [SEP] content: Sorry to post my very first bad review, but please do not buy this item. I have had a garden for years so I know how to grow one. Only one herb grew after planting them all. Please think about it before buying this brand.	negative
title: Don't buy this toaster [SEP] content: Update - after about a month, the toaster stopped popping up. After reviewing the warranty, I have send back the toaster at my cost (will only communicate via letter correspondence), and also include money for them to send it back - FOR A $20 TOASTER. DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER	negative
title: Not what it claims to be [SEP] content: When a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, I believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.The problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.It seems he was never a Lord as he claimed, nor ever a Baronet as he claimed, nor a PhD as he claimed. One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read. That is why I give it one star. It is entertaining. I only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - "The Man of Many Names") as I am sure that will be even more entertaining.	negative
title: Not very accurate [SEP] content: The mechanism inside the step counter is "loose" so any movement adds steps. Also, the counter is on the side, as opposed to the top, and is difficult to read when you're wearing it. For the money - it's not worth a second look.	negative
title: Crap [SEP] content: This is junk, do yourself a favor and buy the one that costs $18 because it is much higher quality. I've gone through 2 of these things, the first one when I tried to insert the battery the connections where the batteries give the device power came out and were deformed in such a way I couldn't put them back in the battery compartment, so I sent it back and ordered another one. The 2nd one seemed to work for like 1 fly, after that it was simply a plastic fly swatter, even when I pressed the button, heard the little sound it makes and tried to kill a fly, it wouldn't kill the fly, nothing would happen. Multipe times I was able to trap the fly underneath the device and despite pushing the button the fly actually flew THROUGH the wholes not getting zapped once. I am done returning this, not once did I receive one that didn't properly work but twice.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Outdated and inaccurate [SEP] content: I don't know where to start. This book recommends activities that I consider to be catastrophically bad for hedgehogs, like keeping them on cedar shavings, which can cause respiratory failure. I just can't recommend.	negative
title: Repetition [SEP] content: This books seems to be a collection of smaller works all mashed together. Many sections are simply bullet point after bullet point. The name is misguided. A better title would be Sustainability ventures of business, government, and policy makers.	negative
title: Do not buy this if you have rhythm or know how to count. [SEP] content: This is perhaps the worst workout video I have ever seen - and I wish I could get my money back. These ladies can't count. There are no transitions, no call outs, no instruction. It's as if they showed up one day and just turned on the camera. If you have ever done any kind of aerobics, have rhythm or know how to dance, you will be extremely frustrated within the first two minutes. The moves don't match the music and they fluctuate between 1 and 3, with 2 and 4. Do NOT buy this.	negative
title: CRAP that sometimes works. [SEP] content: The interface is simple enough but it is just not well built. it freezes all the time. Talk to sirius support much more then I ever should... they can't fix it over 2 months to replace unit and STILL WAITING.DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL RECALL ON THESE. PEOPLE WHO PRAISE THIS HAVE NOT RUN INTO PROBLEMS YET!	negative
title: Not For Adults [SEP] content: This is a good book if you are 13 and under. There is not enough information in it for an adult. If a child wants to learn about five things about church, then this is the book for them.	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!. [SEP] content: We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please..............	negative
title: Sort of readable but forgettable [SEP] content: This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further.	negative
title: Same Formula, No Shift Here [SEP] content: Polar Shift is an incredibly formulaic book, with quite a few borrowed plot points from other generic adventure-action books. Entertaining at times, but very generic, and sloppily written, as if the authors had to crank out yet another novel before the deadline. Very little labor of love exhibited in the writing, I felt like the authors were just punching a time clock to collect their pay.	negative
title: How can you dial the phone with this thing on? [SEP] content: It covers all the buttons on the keypad, protecting them from dust, moisture and from being read and used. A pain to put on and remove. Useless design. Mic hole way to small to be heard properly. I had to cut the keypad section off and use the perimeter for phone cushioning. A full leather case is a better investment.	negative
title: Poison for your dishes? BEWARE! [SEP] content: I bought 2 of these tubs for kitchen tasks. I looked VERY carefully at the product description to see if they contained "microban", because I do not want poisons on/near my food/plates/kitchen utensils.The description doesn't say that these are treated, but THEY ARE!Does anyone out there know where to get tubs like this that are not laced with unnessary chemicals?	negative
title: Not the Same as the Old Splintertweeze [SEP] content: I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be.	negative
title: Not what I saw in the Quantum Pad Sampler Book [SEP] content: I got this book thinking it would fart just like in the sampler book that comes pakaged with the Quantum Pad. But, it dosn't do anything the sampler book does. All it does is get answers wrong!	negative
title: Bad product / bad support [SEP] content: Ours broke after a day. Customer support was difficult but after many frustrating calls we had replacement parts sent. There were no instructions but we eventually got it back together. It broke again a couple days later.	negative
title: Problem with the order. [SEP] content: I ordered this product as a gift. It was stated that it was the ice cream maker with a "bonus ice cream freezer bowl". When it arrived - no bonus bowl was included. I sent an email which was not answered by the time I called Unbeatable Sale, Inc. After checking they said that they had made an error when they offered the bonus bowl. Instead of making it right and sending the bowl, they said I could send it back which of course I knew. It was a take it or leave it situation. As this was a gift for Christmas, I decided to keep it but I am not happy with this company. I don't know whether it makes good ice cream or not since I gave it away.	negative
title: Chateau Benares [SEP] content: Disappointing use of synthetic instruments and over dubs when Mishra's skill as a guitarist would have been perfect.	negative
title: Good book, terrible kindle edition [SEP] content: First, the content of the book wasn't very coherent. Didn't seem to be organized in any particular way, but the stories were interesting at least. I did find it a bit weird that he used fake names for all his former bosses. Don't you think that they'll recognize themselves in the book?The bad part is that Kindle edition has a typo in literally every other sentence. Clearly the result of a poorly OCR'd book without proper proof-reading. Nearly every foreign word was garbled. This made reading a book about cooking (lots of French terms) really annoying. The publisher should be ashamed to put out such a shoddy product.	negative
