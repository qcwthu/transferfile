title: Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere [SEP] content: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.	negative
title: Corelle Apricot Grove 16 pc Set [SEP] content: This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less.	negative
title: good for kids, I guess [SEP] content: The music is way too "synthy" for me. In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is.	negative
title: Few words to describe how bad... [SEP] content: I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and "created" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book.	negative
title: A Little Disappointed [SEP] content: I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there.	negative
title: Amazon rip off [SEP] content: Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.	negative
title: What? [SEP] content: I adore Angelina but this movie had to be one of the stupidest I had seen since I saw Hancock, which was worse. What was the summer of 2008, the summer of the worse, most lame movies ever? It looks like it was.	negative
title: Sadly Disappointed [SEP] content: I am a book lover who hardly lets anyone near my books for fear of getting it handled too much or horrors--bent at the corners and such. As such, I've never in my life came across a book I would so much throw against the wall. And I did, too with Tall, Dark and Cajun. I can't say about her other books since this is the only one of hers I've ever read. I'm sorry, but I was so irritated by the writer's inaccurate reactions to the human behaviours. The funny parts weren't funny, and the steamy parts were gross when characters were quoted as saying,"Oh. Oh." Or something like that. I felt that the writer was just moving the story along and not actually writing.	negative
title: They were not mean for heavy use [SEP] content: I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005. The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess. This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well. Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement. I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them. Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months.	negative
title: Do NOT buy blu-ray set for regular DVD! [SEP] content: Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio "fix" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here.	negative
title: Defective product [SEP] content: The transaction was smooth but the product was defective as the CD on which the software was loaded had been scratched to the point that it would not load.	negative
title: No Bonus Tracks included [SEP] content: I bought this CD for my wife as a gift. The list of songs on this website include "La Tortura" and "Hips Don't Lie". However the CD I recieved does not contain those 2 songs. Those two songs were the reason I bought this CD for my wife. It wasn't until 30 days later after receiving the CD that my wife mentioned those 2 tracks were not on the CD; therefore I cannot return or exchange this CD for the correct version anymore. Please watch out for that when you order this CD. It seems Amazon is shipping the original version of the CD which did not do so well without the Bonus tracks.	negative
title: I should have read the reviews! [SEP] content: Yep, they're right. 100% correct...These lids don't seal at all! Buyer beware. Don't assume that just because it has the Rubbermaid name (which is usually a good choice), that it is a good product. It isn't. Markedly below what I have come to expect from Rubbermaid. And I can't return it because I got this container and then didn't use it for about 2 months. Oh well...at least I didn't pay that much.	negative
title: breaks easily and has bad warrenty [SEP] content: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out	negative
title: Buyers Beware [SEP] content: These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent."Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble	negative
title: Beautiful but useless [SEP] content: I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!	negative
title: MicroSuede Down Throw Brown [SEP] content: Unfortunately, an alternative to the product I ordered was sent to me. Alternative was not acceptable. Am presently working with merchant regarding refund. Spokesperson from merchant has been very prompt and courteous.	negative
title: an unsatisfactory purchase [SEP] content: This tension rod is thin and very weak. It could not hold itself up. Sadly, I will be returning it.	negative
title: What a waste of a cd [SEP] content: If you buy this cd, you like to throw away your cash. Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: Dirty, pages bent over - really used! [SEP] content: As above. I will use it but have to sanitize it first. Only bad experience I've had in the past 25+ years.	negative
title: Written for a twelve year old girl. [SEP] content: I buy my books based on reviews by Amazon. After having read 1/3 of the book, I decided to reread the reviews again and I wouldn't doubt that they are written by the author or her friends and almost all are dated around the same time period. One reviewer stated some drivel about being unable to sleep without the light on again or some such nonsense. This book is "simple". Emily did this or Emily did that. The couple were professing there love on their first date. No suspense. Nothing but boredom. I don't plan on reading the rest of this book and I'm angry that I even spent a dime on it. So beware if you are thinking on purchasing this book and look at the dates on the reviews. I should have guessed these reviews were false d/t the 11 five star reviews. Come on! Not one person gave it less? I tried to find something else she had written and was unable to. Probably because the publisher wasn't going to take a chance on losing more money.	negative
title: Not impressed at all. [SEP] content: I was first introduced to Rachael Davis at the Smoky Hill River Festival in Salina, Kansas (where I'm from) back in 2005. Everyone kept raving about, "oh, she's got a great voice and an extraordinary talent, and she's a great guitarist, blah, blah, blah". Well, I bought the album taking everyone else's advice. I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better.	negative
title: Not a very powerful heater for its size. [SEP] content: I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that.	negative
title: I REALLY tried... [SEP] content: Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, "He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out.	negative
title: Great Idea - disappointing product [SEP] content: I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.	negative
title: Very Poor Quality [SEP] content: Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money.	negative
title: Worked ok for a week, then bit the dust [SEP] content: Would not recommend this transmitter. It worked ok, but there was way more static than my previous one. Worked for about one week - now it won't turn on at all. Maybe I just got a defective one.	negative
title: Horrid Version [SEP] content: If you are a fan, avoid the DERAM versions at all cost. If you are new to the Moody Blues music, then get whatever version you can to just experience the experience.Unfortunely, the Deram discs (at least the ones I have) suffer from a bad mix. Sounding muted at the dynamic tracks, and then way over the top on surround stage with no center stage on other tracks. (of course I know it was recorded on quad to begin with, but how can you almost completely lose some of the spoken parts?)I've heard much better from lesser disks on lesser systems.Point being that this is supposed to be a "better" version. "[ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED]"NOT even close!!	negative
title: Good Idea, Ineptly Done [SEP] content: I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on "The Switch," won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart.	negative
title: I never got it [SEP] content: HI I never got the baby pool and I didnt know who to call to let you know I didnt get it I would like If I can get that pool some time soon seen as I paid for it if you have any questions to ask me call me at 508 540 4272 I would really like that alot thank you so muchChristina Jones	negative
title: costly but worth it [SEP] content: I long quit listening with my SR-60s because of the pad discomfort. Now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so I looked into replacements. With a little bending up of the head-piece, these L-CUSH's fit great, and I can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. The price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of Grado's for $25. Really not a bad deal, and I couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones.	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: A delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. We originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. My husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too.	positive
title: Exactly what I expected [SEP] content: Mostly older songs, some "crossovers" duplicated in other Hal Leonard fake books. If you are looking for more recent music, say from the last 15 years or so, this book will disappoint. Meets my needs exactly, so very satisfied. Bought a used copy for the price break. Some of the pages had been dog-eared as place markers, but utility and completeness not affected.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive
title: amazing [SEP] content: this carpet cleaner makes wonders! just spray it over, let it sit for a couple of minutes, and rub it with terry towel, after it dries off, vacuum and it makes your carpets look like new. Probably the best carpet cleaner i've ever used.	positive
title: Ah the games woman play [SEP] content: While I generally don't like to see women play games to win a man, Pandora's character begins her games in a way that is engaging and entertaining. There does come a point at which you just want to say, oh give it up already.... but just as you say that, the heroine herself begins to question the game as well! Great timing, witty dialogue	positive
title: This is readable although it is DC crossover [SEP] content: It is not even near three books with death and return of Superman, but it has great ending. You don't have to know lot about DC history before events in this book. Three and half stars , maybe...	positive
title: Print Cartridges [SEP] content: Excellent bargain...I have ordered this product for the past year and will continue to do so. Excellent print life for the cartridges.	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: This Hard Drive actually works! [SEP] content: After suffering with a useless Maxtor 160 HD, this WD drive works as advertised. I wanted a HD that you could simply 'drag & drop' files onto the WD desktop icon - saved & done. Files can then be recovered or reviewed easily by clicking on the same icon. The USB power source eliminates one 110 V plug in from your setup. A final plus - the WD HD is compact - 1/4 the size of the Maxtor!The Maxtor HD required a schedule for saving files - totally useless - it made a nice hum (so does my clothes dryer) & the entry screen appeared on the desktop, but it never worked!! Want to buy it cheap??	positive
title: Mean Girls was The Best film ever made and still is today since 04. [SEP] content: Mean Girls I would have to say was the best film I have ever seen. It had great acting by Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, Rachel McAdams as Regina George, and of course Tina Fey as Sharon Norbury. The other performers were great as well. The script/ dialouge was great I loved it. It was just the best film I've ever seen. If you love comedy's/romance's thoose type's of films you will defently love Mean Girls.	positive
title: This book will change your mind about war. [SEP] content: I recently took a class on war, and this book was used as one of the textbooks. After reading this book, my entire preception of war has changed. Mr. Blainey has shown me so much that I never even thought about before. Not only that, but he exposes several myths about wars. For example, some people believe that wars can happen by accident. Blainey even puts up a good argument for it, but in the end, he explains why that is folly. It is truly an excelent book that I would recommend to anyone interested in war.	positive
title: Very good UK entry [SEP] content: While we in the US load up on VH1 celebreality, the Brits make a great zombie mini series. Once again, corporate America complains about the internet, yet they don't make it available in the US. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead 2004/28 days etc, you should "seek" this one out. Very enjoyable story of an outbreak on the set of Big Brother.	positive
title: Pricey ~ but it delivers the goods [SEP] content: Good information on the periods, materials and types of antique boxes most frequently collected. Photography excellent and item pricing accurate. I love this book and it's helped me enormously.	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: Yummy! [SEP] content: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!	positive
title: Connor loves it! [SEP] content: I'm so happy that I bought this for my new little man, Connor Thomas. He loves it. At first I was only going to buy one but I got such a good deal, that I got three (blue, white and green.) And what a good decision that was! Connor loves his blankets! We have to have one with us at all times. They're light weight, perfect for crib bedding, beautiful, and sooo soft!!! WOW! I wish this brand sold them in larger sizes for my bed. I'm very please with my purchase. If you buy one you won't regret. Worth every cent.	positive
title: Good seller good product [SEP] content: I mistyped my shipping address but Cables Unlimited corrected the problem immediately and re-shipped at no extra cost. They provided great communication and cooperation. When the ZipLinq arrived, it worked fine. I use it to connect my MP3 player to my car stereo. ZipLinq provides a secure connection at both ends, it is easy to adjust the length of the cable and the sound quality is excellent. The retracting cable works smoothly and it makes storage easy and convenient. I hope it lasts a long time.	positive
title: Move Over Harry Connick, Jr [SEP] content: I purchased this CD yesterday and I totally agree with the majority here Matt Dusk is a wonderfully talented new artist with a lush voice and he isn't bad to look at either. The title song "Two Shots" is a great song written by Bono. My personal faves are "Lonely Road" and "Every Mother's Son". For the reviewers who stated that there is nothing new and original here try listening to it again. I think Ole Blue Eyes would be quite impressed with Matt.	positive
title: Very romantic [SEP] content: You can listen to the entire album without skiping to the next track.A very nice mix of country, folk and popular music.Must have album for dinner parties!!!One of the greatest voices I have ever heard.	positive
title: Funny [SEP] content: Best show on television. With the rest of the television becoming reality tv, it is good to see something well writtten, funny and no canned laughter.	positive
title: Organic bar with good taste and texture [SEP] content: This is one of the better tasting bars I've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of "nutty" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other "energy" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. I think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. I'll be purchasing more of these.	positive
title: Great MP3; Needs work on the video and shuffle play flexibility [SEP] content: This ipod is great for storing your entire CD collection and still have plenty of space for your latest 100-2000 pictures to share with family and friends. I would like to see some improvements from Apple on the following:1. Video quality - the screen is small and the quality is not real great especially in fast moving action shots2. Must use iTunes - This is sad because there are better applications out there3. Shuffle Play is limited - It is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist. For 2 - 4 GB that works ok, but when you have your entire CD collection loaded up, it is difficult to just play a particular Genre or even artist.	positive
title: Carcassonne The River 2 [SEP] content: I cannot play without the River 2. It adds a whole new dynamic competitiveness to start each game. A must have	positive
title: loves to read [SEP] content: The book is a very good read for anyone who likes drama mixed with romance. Altho most of the time I could predict where the plot was going, it was still very interesting to see how the author delt with it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense.	positive
title: This spectacle is truly fantastic. [SEP] content: To experience Alejandro Sanz, you need to see where he`s comming from. for those who didn`t know who Sanz was before the unplugged, this is a great chance to see what is all about. This concert take place in Barcelona, and you can see his "Tour Mas" one of the biggets points in his career. take the opportun ity to see him live, and to discover the real Alejandro on stage.	positive
title: Interesting, well-written! [SEP] content: Greatly enjoyed learning about the history of zero and loved Kaplan's writing style. His enthusiasm for this topic is clear throughout the book and he keeps the topic interesting and dynamic, rather than reverting to a textbook format.	positive
title: Great help with plantar fasciitis! [SEP] content: This support and the night split fixed my plantar fasciitis when nothing else did. Highly recommended! Buy this!	positive
title: Enjoyable Small Group Swing [SEP] content: Until I heard this cd, I never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman. I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections ("Oh, Lady Be Good", "Avalon", "Shine" and "Rosetta" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set.	positive
title: Awesome sweeper for pet hair! [SEP] content: I absolutely love this sweeper. I keep it charged all the time and use whenever there is anything to pick up. It actually picks up pet hair better than my vacuum cleaners.	positive
title: Fascinating [SEP] content: This a very interesting book, and will give you information you probably never knew... some entries are a little glossed over, but for the most part it will keep you busy for a while. It doesn't discuss information from the the most recent novels (Like the 2nd Han Solo Trilogy) or the Phantom Menace of course, but oh well.	positive
