title: good brother, Bad brother [SEP] content: this was a very interesting read . I learned many things reading this book. I have suggested others should read it.	positive
title: ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! [SEP] content: This is not only one of the best punk songs ever recorded, it's one of the best songs period. This song is as close to perfection as you can get, both lyrically and musically. You would think that an 18 minute song would be boring at times, but not this one. The changes in tempo and the scathing political commentary keep your interest the entire time. This is a masterpiece.	positive
title: Very useful book [SEP] content: Book was recommended for use by Interpreter Training program teacher as an additional tool. I have gotten considerable use out of it over the past year in my transliterating and asl classes. Only one drawback just recently noted. The DVD is not supported by the newer MAC OS Lion systems so I'm forced to use it on a Windows based computer. Other than that, very satisfied with this book.	positive
title: Trims well [SEP] content: This product works very well. The 3 cutting guides allow you to pick the correct length. There is an adjustable cutting guide that was of no use. The charger has to be plugged into the trimmer instead of just putting the trimmer into a charging cradle. This is inconvenient.	positive
title: Love and Trust [SEP] content: She suffered a terrible loss. But she found the love and trust she needed to go forward. You will cry.	positive
title: Phantom of the Opera original novel [SEP] content: Fantastic condition, NEW. Halfway through the book, enjoying it immensely.Perfect purchase, great seller.	positive
title: Fantastic Voyage [SEP] content: I first heard the Waybacks driving to the airport. Told my wife, "Hey this is really good stuff!" I'm pretty critical of what I listen to. I listen a lot, but not everything catches my ear. First heard them do I Wanna Be Like You and loved every minute. Then we saw the guys in person in Rutherfordton, NC. What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. I hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. If you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.	positive
title: It's OK, does the job [SEP] content: The Panavise Junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK. The ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and I would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. I'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. I've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts.	positive
title: What a GREAT STORIE! [SEP] content: From the first page you are sucked into this adventure! When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. From that point on you can't put the book down. It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone. I would have given this more than 5 stars. It is a keeper on my shelf. I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: An excellent book and analysis [SEP] content: This book is a very impressive piece of work. Shattan is very fair when he writes about each and every person, no matter what their political stripe. From Churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to Truman's acknowledgement of the danger that Communism posed to Adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the West to Solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the Cold War was really a moral struggle to Pope John Paul II's unwavering determination to free Poland to Ronald Reagan who ultimately caused the end of the Cold War; even though it came under Bush's administration; Shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis. This is well worth reading for anyone interested in the Cold War.	positive
title: Absolutely Addictive [SEP] content: I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions. They were so elegant. Very interesting saga. Well developed interesting characters.	positive
title: this is the BEST toy ! [SEP] content: I raise Lab puppies for Canine Companions...so I almost always have a lab puppy around.....this toy has NEVER been destroyed ( little feet chewed off though) The squeaker has always remained intact. It is a perfect dog toy for land or water play. My current pup LOVES making it squeak so much so that my parrot can now imitate the squeak!	positive
title: Texas Holdem Table Top [SEP] content: This product will do exactly the job it was designed for. I am pleased with with the quality, and feel that it is a good value I recommend it to all who enjoy poker.	positive
title: Beautiful game with lots of options! [SEP] content: Now, bear in mind -- I'm not an avid gamer - in fact I rarely play computer games altogether nowadays. My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. Perfect for kids and adults alike!	positive
title: Thanks! [SEP] content: Thanks for the speedy delivery. As a customer ordering from Germany I didn't expect to receive it so soon. Thanks!	positive
title: Loved it [SEP] content: Loved this cd. If you have heard CJ's first few albums and enjoyed them you will definately enjoy this. I recommend this for any CJ fan.	positive
title: a collect call from the sacremento county jail. [SEP] content: a dope album from another gardenblocc gangster. In his own words, "I wrote from the perspective of crack rock." Believe it. A shame we must lose another bomb MC to the prison system. Believe it.	positive
title: rage rocks [SEP] content: I have only had this cd for about a week. One of my friends told me about them so I bought it. At first I was unimpressed; but the more I listened the better it got. Rage is now my most likly favorite band and would recomend this CD to any one.	positive
title: Courtship of the Vicars Daughter [SEP] content: Loved this story,could hardly put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting story.	positive
title: Great stool for the price [SEP] content: This is a great looking stool for the price--Yes, assembly is a bit of a pain, but it took me about 25 minutes to put together (not too bad in my opinion)...just looks a little daunting at first seeing all the pieces it requires. The instructions and pictures are very easy to understand and follow.We haven't gotten too much use out of it yet, since both my kids are a little young yet, but I imagine a non-slip stick-on of some sort would be a good extra safety precaution to add to the stool.	positive
title: Great Support [SEP] content: Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.	positive
title: My favorite, wish was was in kindle [SEP] content: This was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that I purchased, but should not have to write so many words	positive
title: Works just like it's suppose to [SEP] content: The house we rent has a small washer/dryer and the vent runs up and out through the ceiling. The dryer motor isn't strong enough to push all the lint up and out so we ran the ProFlex down to the floor and now the dryer works much better.The only issue is that on a warm day, the heat from the dryer stays in the house and can make it even warmer inside. On the upside, on a cold day we don't have to run the heat so much.	positive
title: Fair fairy drawing [SEP] content: This book is easy to use and to read with some amusing and interesting fairy facts the sketched and line drawings are worth a good look at and the part about the different types of wings is acurate and interesting.I love the book and the ideas for changing the types of fairy's eg attitude and style.	positive
title: Family Favorite [SEP] content: If you love the Muppets you will love The Muppet Christmas Carol! This is one of the best versions of The Christmas Carol because it pretty much stays true to the original storyline, but it will not bore you out of you mind. This is a film for young and old. Great music, great humor, great characters, Great Muppetry!!! This is my families all-time favorite Christmas movies.	positive
title: Pleased [SEP] content: I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut. Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound... the old style.	positive
title: Pretty Good!! [SEP] content: This album is actually really good. Although short, it's definitely showsMonica has matured. Although the first track that was released was not that great, tracks like dozen roses and gotta move on makes us remember why fans will continue to support Monica. Hell No is definitely one of the best tracks on the album but what i didn't like is the fact that she tries the rapping too much. I prefer to hear her voice and think that she should stay true to the talented R&B; Singer that she is.	positive
title: VERY good reading! [SEP] content: Everything is well explained. I recommend it very strongly to anyone interested in Judaism. Starts simple but by Chapter 2 its heavily into Orthodox with hardly a mention of Conservatism!	positive
title: Genuine is almost always the best way to go! [SEP] content: Pretty straight forward, works like a champ. Genuine Canon, heavier cable (wish it was a tad bit longer).Love it.	positive
title: Pretty, well fitting belt. [SEP] content: Bought this as a gift for a friend who always had to borrow a brown belt from me. It is simple and cute. Great addition to any outfit, and it is well made.	positive
title: Fun to be "Sloppy" [SEP] content: A year in the life of a teenage girl named Jessica Darling. Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away. Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts.	positive
title: Very moisturizing, love it! [SEP] content: I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.	positive
title: I'm being generous with the two stars [SEP] content: This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing andelementary at best. I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC.	negative
title: Very Cheap - Low Quality [SEP] content: I was excited to see the great price, and was hoping to see a halfway descent product. Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up. I regret this purchase and will be returning for a refund.	negative
title: Do not purchase for eReaders [SEP] content: This book is so poor in format for an eReader that I am recommending you not purchase it in this format at all. The pages don't line up properly. Some pages have black backgrounds, some white, and several don't even wrap properly. The content is ok, but hard to follow because of previous issues noted.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: defective [SEP] content: I'v just received the sheet set today. The sheet itself is soft and the color is beautiful as advertised. However,I 've found the defective. It was cut (about 3 inches)and the fabric is torn aprt. I have to return the stuff...very disappointed.	negative
title: Double boiler is only half [SEP] content: What??? A double boiler without the bottom part that holds the water isn't functional. It should be made CLEAR that it comes as only the top part with a curved bottom that won't stand on it's own. Thusly, unless the other part, which is another saucepan w/ lid is purchased, you're out of luck. Btw, the other half costs as much as the double boiler.	negative
title: CONFUSING [SEP] content: I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one.	negative
title: A Work of an ignorant conductor - Bad continuo choice [SEP] content: Harpsichord should be replaced with a organ and one or more theorbo. It is highly in doubt that Henry Purcell ever used 8'/4' choired type harpsichord to support continuo part for his trumpet composition. There are indeed Virginal (small & relatively inexpensive version of harpsichord) but these loud type harpsichords here were non existent throughout the époque of Sir William Byrd, Sir John Dowland, Sir John Blow, Sir Edward Stafford, Henry Purcell and his two brothers Sir.Thomas and Sir.Daniel Purcell, all held a royal positions in France, Denmark and England one or more times in their lives. I Suggest that the conductor resign from his post and should give up all harpsichord parts and get advises from Sir John Elliott Gardiner, William Christie, David Taylor, Konrad Junghanell and like to redo the work of Purcell. Those true gentlemen have great deal of knowledgeabout Purcell's work.	negative
title: impossible to clean [SEP] content: I bought this pan as a trial -- thinking that if I liked it I would buy a set of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. I won't be buying more. I've only used it three times, and as far its preformance is concerned it seems fine -- the heat distribution is good, and the food came out well. However, after only three uses, it has developed an ugly hazy stain that is impossible to remove. I've followed all the cleaning instructions that came with the pan, but to no avail. The "hard-anodized" aluminum doesn't seem so hard after all.	negative
title: Only has a couple of good cartoons [SEP] content: I didn't like this DVD ... I enjoy the black and white Popeye and there wasn't too many of them on this disc. I never did care for the color Popeye, and this is mostly what is on this DVD. I gave my copy away to the Library and bought the black and white Popeye that is from 1933-40. Must better DVD.	negative
title: WARNING:THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: My friends first and foremost I would want everyone to ignore the previous reviewer(An alias of Whirligig) and avoid this lousy Green Day cd.Green day are legends only in the previous reviewer"s mind.Their only listenable cd is Dookie which only deserves a two star rating.Forget Green day,listen to Led Zeppelin's debut album instead.that rocks!,not this.	negative
title: Roller Hardness Problem [SEP] content: I was originally delighted with this opener. I like safety openers and my last one, a Swiss-made one, lasted a dozen years. This opener worked very well for the first several weeks, but the cutting edge wore down to the point of uselessness after only 3 months. The cutting wheel is made of a softer steel than is needed for long-term use. Older versions may not have had this problem. This opener is now made in China.	negative
title: Good phone UNTIL the screen dies on you! [SEP] content: Overall I liked this phone - until a weeks after the warranty expired the screen DIED! Yes, folks - the internal screen on these phones have a 1 yr lifespan...Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use it for less then 1 yr!I am not kidding.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: My days ruined! [SEP] content: I was all excited about recieving this blender for a birthday present & when after buying all these ingredients to make hummus, I started mixing it in the blender & in 10 minutes I smelled the smell of a burnt out motor & sure enough it died then & there.I don't know if I'll even bother getting another blender cause I had another slightly cheaper one recently made by Proctor Silex that I got 2 full uses out of it before that one died so that assures me that today's quality is crap compared to old school.The Kitchen my partents had lasted for decades!Don't throw away reciept & packing box if you buy this blender!!!	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: frustrated to the MAX [SEP] content: I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash.	negative
title: o god give it up [SEP] content: ok people. lets get this straight. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE FAKE, WANNABE, RADIO-FRIENDLY, POP. they are not punk. if u want real punk buy M.I.A. The Complete Anthology by the germs. i am sick of all these people who do nothing but shop at hot topic and pretend they are punk. REAL PUNK IS ANGER. THIS PUNK IS FASHION.DESTROY EVERYTHING!	negative
title: YHE WORST OF ALL [SEP] content: IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL	negative
title: What's So Funny? [SEP] content: I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of "Lord of the Flies." It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.	negative
title: Dovetail rings [SEP] content: These will NOT fit a standard weaver or picatinny rail.....they are for 3/8" dovetail mounts and I just wasted my money. Be foreworned-apparently I missed the 22 part but the description talks about weaver mounts so idk.	negative
title: A Weak Attempt at Espresso [SEP] content: I had an ancient Krups espresso machine and decided I wanted an upgrade. Researched and chose the Cuisinart EM-100 as a reasonably priced entry level machine. My first unit had to be returned as the power button would not stay on. My second unit operates properly but there are multiple quality issues. The espresso is weak despite multiple attempts and variations of grind and tamping pressure. The unit advertises that it heats water for making tea - but it only heats to 165-180 degrees - not hot enough for tea. I have contacted Cuisinart by phone and email to see if they have any suggestions and have received no responses. All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I have had good experiences with Cuisinart products in the past but will probably never buy another.	negative
title: Very disappointing [SEP] content: My son was very disappointed when he received this item. It looks nothing like the picture. The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture. I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this. I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available.	negative
title: Not adequate for most home cleaning [SEP] content: I bought this steamer at a local store, and returned it after trying once. It is small, well-built and convenient to carry around. However, I found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs. The heat was not enough and the pressure was not enough for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us. I'm waiting for a powerful hand held steamer.	negative
title: It you buy this item, cross your fingers [SEP] content: I ordered this spice rack and one of the arms was broken when I recieved it. I returned it to Amazon and they shipped me another one right away. It was broken in the exact same way. The other reviews say the same thing. If you order this, cross your fingers that it doesn't come broken.	negative
title: Not good [SEP] content: This product does not work as advertised. With sensitive skin in leaves red markswhere hair is removed. On legs it does not remove hair. Only makes it shorter.Save your money. I would send it back if it wasn't too late. My face is a mess.	negative
title: To ride a carousel is fun for a while !! [SEP] content: Listening to this music is like riding a carousel; its great fun, but in the end you're back where you started and then it all starts over again.I mean I loved Genesis and the art rock scene when I first heard their tunes in the middle of the 70:s. But this , whats the point? It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke	negative
title: waste of money [SEP] content: only worked twice, then stopped. not worth it. i would not recommend this product there are other more expensive which will work better	negative
title: still waiting for a response [SEP] content: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar...	negative
title: Just don't buy it....trust me [SEP] content: It just doesn't work up to even a quarter of what you think it will do.When it does work, it takes to to the "pinnacle" of a project, then either crashes, won't burn, or will burn with very messy results and will make you very sorry you spent money and time on this piece of garbage.	negative
title: WHAT??? [SEP] content: When I recieved this game, it had two HUGE scratches on it, and I tried using a disk saver, but that didn't work. So now I have a game that doesn't work. :(	negative
title: Will have adverse effects on your Xbox! [SEP] content: Seemed to work fine at first, just made the whole thing louder. A couple months later though, I started receiving an error relatively frequently on startup. It wasn't the Red Ring of Death, but an error nonetheless, along with a wierd moaning whirring coming from the Xbox. I thought the Xbox was going bad. I started looking for another one of these for my new Elite, and came across all the other reviews about this bad product. I took it off my old Xbox, and it worked great again. Luckily as far as I can tell it didn't do any noticeable long lasting damage. Hopefully it will still last awhile when I give it to my brother. It's definitely not worth the risk!	negative
