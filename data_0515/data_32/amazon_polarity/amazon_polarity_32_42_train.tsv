title: The special effects were cool... [SEP] content: And that was about it. The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.	negative
title: bad vacume advance [SEP] content: had the dissy in my car and had lots of trouble with it at idle played with the cam and dissy settings with no luck, finally pulled it out and sent it off to be tested and got a report back that it was pulling on 40 degrees of advance at idle.had it adjusted and re curved for my application and now the problem is solved, Not very happy for what is meant to be a quality American product.I recommend if you purchase one have it tested and set to suit your application other wise you may have no end of troubles.	negative
title: Vulgar, distasteful, dumb [SEP] content: There's no doubt that Popa Chubby has a fair amount of talent, but "Booty & The Beast" suffers from guitar hero stylings and a lack of taste. The CD is just like Chubby's live shows-brash, outlandish, and just short of the type of thing that could give New York City a bad name in the blues forever. Avoid at all costs.	negative
title: Chalk another one up for DOA [SEP] content: Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product. Unfortunately, I never received an unbroken skillet. On the bright side, 5 stars for Amazon's excellent handling of returns.I ordered the skillet and received it via 2nd day UPS with a 2-inch crack down the side. I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware.	negative
title: Fans of this book [SEP] content: I can't resist any longer, I must finally just state it baldly: conservatives are borderline illiterates. The reviews of this book have made it so clear. Poor spelling, punctuation and grammar: loved it. Good spelling, punctuation and grammar: did not love it. Does this matter? Well, as it indicates a lack of little things like education and involvement in the world -- the real world, not A.M. radio -- I think it does. I promise I will take the conservative line seriously when it comes spelled and punctuated properly.	negative
title: Great Idea--unbelievably bad sound! [SEP] content: I ordered this game for the kids to play over the summer. With over 5,000 geography questions, I was looking forward to it myself! We were all very disappointed to discover that the sound was so bad that we couldn't understand the question most of the time. If you could understand Charlie Brown's teacher, then you'll love this game!	negative
title: Convert [SEP] content: Geza Vermes is a renowned scholar who seems to have focused on researching from his own psychological backgrounds. A former Catholic priest who converted to his parents Judaic roots, he seems to continue his efforts to process this experience through his scholarship. Unfortunately, his writing and exegesis are so clouded with his own hang ups, that they strain credulity.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!! [SEP] content: My 6 year old bought this seat with her own money. She was very excited when she saw how real it looked (on the box anyway). It is defintely the biggest piece of junk we have ever purchased!! The seat cover never stays on. Her doll which is 15 in long barely fits (cleary states on the box it is for this size doll). This could of been made so much nicer. It was a very cute idea but awful quality. Fisher Price should be ashamed to have their name on the product.	negative
title: blah, blah, blah [SEP] content: Spoiler alert - if you saw "Full Impact" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close.	negative
title: Several hundred pages of fluff... [SEP] content: If you have no idea what you're doing get this book. It does a good job of summarizing the apps in SBS. If you want hard core, real-world examples and tips look somewhere else...if I knew where I'd tell ya.	negative
title: No story resolution [SEP] content: This story was about as deep as one of those bars of hotel soaps on the cover. I didn't give a cr*p about any of the characters or their neurosis'. The ending provided no resolution to the 1 of the 2 main storylines. The author also wasted to many pages talking from the perspective of an in-utero & newborn. Reading this, I thought I was projecting myself into one of those "Look Who's Talking" movies. Waste of time.	negative
title: I think I will by buying another cupcake book [SEP] content: I bought this booking thinking WOW! With 500 recipes how could I ever want another book? I have tried 2 of the recipes (buying special ingredients from the grocery specifically for these recipes) and I was very disappointed. The cupcakes came out dry and course. I followed the recipe perfectly and I really don't think I will try another recipe. However, there are some really good ideas in this book. I really wanted to make the Key Lime Cupcakes this weekend so I made white cupcakes from a box mix and then followed the directions for the filling and frosting from the book - they turned out great! I'm sure I will use some ideas from this book, but probably not try to make another recipe from scratch.	negative
title: Fantasy and dangerous [SEP] content: This book is a fantasy and dangerous. Most of the items on this book and all of Buscaglia books are fantasy. Yes, Leo kind of acknowledge that it is wishful thinking what he is talking about but that statement is meant for you to let down your guard. And if what he said is able to pass into your subconscious mind, it can be very dangerous. As his book has many trojan virus that if pass into your subconscious mind can wreck havoc. Just as a computer virus can wreck havoc to your computer system, so can Buscaglia mental virus within his book. I will give you an example of a virus in his book. One of the book point was "Learn to trust again" and "Love trust". If that one point was able to by pass your conscious mind defense and into your subconscious mind, it can wreck havoc to your human computer (Mind). And there are many more virus within his book. Be wary of Buscaglia book readers.	negative
title: at the end [SEP] content: when this was 1st released on vhs back in the 90s i bought it then i bought it again but now its not what it used to be its so dated their is nothing much to it, they stand in the same place playing the same songs that they did on every dvd after this - when this came out it was something cool that they have made a live vhs cause all that were available just a song from london and that was live as well, but now its clearly a dvd to cash in cause they look tired in every other dvd	negative
title: Lousy Customer Service [SEP] content: Can't say how good a GPS this is. After I plugged it in to be updated, I get a message No Maps Found. TomTom customer service is absoutely lousy. I've been able to learn to where and how to return this defective TomTom One. The company is not standing behind it's product, and neither is Amazon.	negative
title: Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati [SEP] content: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read "Into the Wilderness" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author.	negative
title: Fragrence Review [SEP] content: The product is fine. The scent a little weak. The bottle is not a shape that is easy to use. Possible a little pricey.	negative
title: "Not in stock" [SEP] content: "Not in stock" is what I always eventually hear when trying to get this product, a-f-t-e-r, of course, I complete an order and have been waiting a week. This product is no longer being made! I put together a state of the art computer in 2004 using this leading edge ram, made by Kingston no less, and it is now no longer made!!! Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram).	negative
title: easy set up [SEP] content: Nothing could be easier to set up than this remote and very easy to operate.Support is there with a phone call for missing codes, fully programmable and a learning remote as well. My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning "not possible" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected.	negative
title: Not a Rabbit on it. [SEP] content: I ordered this because I collect Spode rabbit dishes. There is no rabbit on the one I was sent. It has quail and ducks. No rabbits. Yet rabbit is the first word in the title. The Rabbit Lady	negative
title: Do not buy it! [SEP] content: Got the battery with the docking station. I only got three pictures before it went low. I have had no luck with it keeping a charge past one picture since.	negative
title: Buyer Beware, Not What It Looks Like [SEP] content: Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!	negative
title: Misleading [SEP] content: This product is very misleading. The commercial is so misrepresentative of the product. Nothing about this product is fun. The directions are hard to interpret and the "arm" itself could not crush a cottonball. Poor packaging. I would not recommend this toy for anyone.	negative
title: Not as described [SEP] content: I tried this on Dr. Brown, Playtex & Avent. It doesn't fit it any of these 3 brands. Not recommended.	negative
title: cheap [SEP] content: great series but cheap packaging wish i knew had crappy packaging would not have bought; will have to buy dvd cases to put in or have to replace the dvds eventuallyStargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection	negative
title: For the rest of us... [SEP] content: Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say "had" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Not Free SF Reader [SEP] content: Realware is nowhere near as much fun as the other three books in thewhole Ware series. The theme and tone have changed considerably.You get a feelgood romance thrown in there for no real apparentreason. The Realware of the title is the technology to be able to makewhatever you want, basically. Chuck in some aliens and other dimensions.	negative
title: Disatisfied [SEP] content: I didn't like it because it will not allow you to bookmark a page so that you can continue where you left off. Plus it will not allow you to highlight anything so that you can go back and review it later. It's pointless to read anything because of the two reasons mentioned earlier. This is the earlier version. From what I understand the later version will let you do these two things.	negative
title: Problems right away! [SEP] content: Well, we put the elliptical together, that was not bad. Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????	negative
title: Honestly one of the worst books I have read [SEP] content: This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead.	negative
title: a bad book [SEP] content: just looking that the preview that's available i can already tell that this is a bad book. some of the drawings look like kindergarten drawings or chicken scratch. stay away from this book.	negative
title: The best import album you'll ever buy... [SEP] content: I bought this album in the UK, and it really is brilliant. Its everyhing you ever wanted from the UK Club scene rolled into 2 CD's. Its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of Ibiza to the UK charts. Any Americans into the club music of the UK should definately buy this CD... its not the best Kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year.	positive
title: Great book for the rockabilly guitar novice [SEP] content: This book does an excellent job at pacing you from exercise to exercise than into songs that play on what you've learned. Although the Travis picking style can be difficult to get your head around. I would suggest first taking some basic lessons from a guitar teacher comfortable with the Travis style, than get this book.	positive
title: Loved it. [SEP] content: I couldn't wait to see how it ended. (To me, it was more a book where I wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). Once it did, I'm sorry that it's over. It's in my head now - I keep thinking I can go pick up my book and read, then I remember I finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time.	positive
title: Gary Gygax is the Master. [SEP] content: I have been roleplaying for years, many many years. I have seen games come and go, I have seen the white box set of G. Gygax. I have seen games like RuneQuest, Warhammer FRP, MERP, Torg, so many games.Yet this is the real start, the real truth of how great roleplaying can be. You might find 3rd edition more intricate, more things to do in it, but the original AD&D players manual and DM manual were the best in my humble opinion.This book shows how to create characters quick and just start roaming the worlds that the DM makes. GET IT. and the Dungeon Master Manual by G. Gygax. You will love it better than almost anything else the roleplaying world has to offer.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: These DVD's are wonderful. The scenery is fantastic and the music is well done. I use them for riding my stationary bike and they make my workout 100% more enjoyable.	positive
title: A valuable resource with hard to find information [SEP] content: When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.	positive
title: Works but watch where you put it [SEP] content: Careful to put the adaptor at a high place like on top of your desk hutch. Do the same for the wireless access point. It makes a much better signal.	positive
title: THE BEST EVER STAR WARS NOVEL [SEP] content: AMAZING - Thrawn is back! When I first picked up this book I could hardley put it down. Zahn writes in a style matched by no one. The story is that it turns out the Bothans were the ones responsible for helping Palpatine destroying a long lost world. The news comes out and everyone wants to either kill the Bothans or save them. Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself. Zahn includes all the classic charactars whom other authors have seem to forgotten - Mara Jade, the Noghri, Pallaeon. On top of this he mixes Stakpoles Rougue Squadron and Booster Terrik. All in all this action packed novel has you eating out of it's hand. Buy it at all costs. Oh yeah, Just try working out who or what the Hand of Thrawn actually is - when you do read the next book you'll be in for quite a suprise.	positive
title: Fun workout! [SEP] content: I absolutely HATE working out, but this DVD is actually fun for me! I am not at all coordinated, so I know I don't look like the "Island Girl" in the video, but as long as no one sees me, I love doing this workout!	positive
title: Darkly Beguiling [SEP] content: Any collection of Robert W Chambers's "King in Yellow" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--"The Yellow Sign," "The Repairer of Reputations," and "In the Court of the Dragon"--are included in this volume. Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle. The missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: "The Prophet's Paradise," "The Street of the Four Winds," "The Street of the First Shell," "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields," and "Rue Barree." Had the current volume included these tales, I would have given it the highest possible marks. Still, it is an excellent collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated Robert W. Chambers.	positive
title: Terrific case for running with Nike+ [SEP] content: I would highly recommend this case if you are a runner and are using the Nike+ iPod system. I have had this case for almost a year and I still love it. I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod. I will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much I have used it.	positive
title: A solid effort [SEP] content: This was a solid effort, not as good as their ealier stuff, but better than a lot that would come later. This album was a top ten hit in the US when it was released in 1982 and produced two hit singles "Wasted on the Way" and "Southern Cross" and a third minor hit "Too Much Love To Hide". Other strong songs include "Into the Darkness" and "Daylight Again", which is an excellent update of the Stills classic "Find the Cost of Freedom". This release is helped by the addition of 4 bonus tracks not included on the original release.	positive
title: Wrong Point of View [SEP] content: My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive
title: Hot Hoops Additional Equipment [SEP] content: This game has been very entertaining for my grandson, however, I need to know how to purchase additional basketball balls for the game.	positive
title: A masterpiece, a mind's voyage to its own feelings [SEP] content: This film made me cry, scream, and tremble with emotion. It inspired me, it made me see the world in a different way. The fact that this film is out of print terrified me, I had it once but soon got lost, most probably in some guy's hands. I got to have it. I need it.	positive

All you need is a pencil and a mind to enjoy puzzles which are offered in a spiral bound large-format paperback lending to easier working than most puzzle books. Here are over eighty puzzles created by the puzzle writing company Puzzability: new blends rather than rehashes of old styles. Avid puzzle fans will find it delightfully fun.Diane C.

title: Kizuna [SEP] content: The First Japanese Animated Gay Love Story: Leave it to the Japanese . Not only did they develop the transistor radio, but now they're first out of the gate with an animanted gay love story! And it's a beaut, all about two high shcool lovers whose relationship is threatened by a sinister Mafioso who tries to come between them. Frank, in the extreme!	positive
title: Great solution if you have an xBox 360 [SEP] content: Setting up this remote was a painless user experience. I plugged it in, let the Logitech software download the latest firmware, input the list of brands and models of the equipment I have, the software suggested a list of activities, and less than five minutes later everything just worked.I did the configuration on a Macintosh - a lot of times vendors deliver poorly written software for the Mac, but the Logitech software for this remote didn't suck. They also included the USB cable needed to program it, and since the packaging allows you to press a button and see a demo, they included a second set of batteries to ensure you didn't end up with a dead set.I picked this because I wanted to be able to control my xBox 360, but it also works with my Apple TV.Apple MA711LL/A TV with 40GB Hard DriveXbox 360 Console Includes 20GB Hard Drive	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: Just like when I was a kid! [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!	positive
title: Views of a formulator of Omega 3 products [SEP] content: I was very happy to find Dr. Schmidts book, "SMART FATS". Having spent several years researching EFA Balance, I found the information in his book to be very accurate and a wonderful information source. This country is in dire need for Omega Balance and for the knowledge to know why. Hurray for "SMART FATS"!Stanley R. Mann, VP. Research and Education Integrity Direct Inc.	positive
title: Fish Fry [SEP] content: This item was used at a Fish Fry. And it was fantastic, once we put the fish in all we had to do was wait forit to float to the top. It came out golden brown. Next time will use it for a Fun Raiser an let the pot pay for itself.	positive
title: Elvis' Wall of Sound [SEP] content: Highly relevant to how one appreciates EC's third album is the quality of the production. While the quality of the songs and songwriting is as great as the other reviewers state, many were turned off by the 'Wall of Sound' production values introduced on this third album. I still feel that all of the reverb and track layering, although often suited to the thematic content, mars my experience of these great songs, decades later.	positive
title: Amazing..Great Book [SEP] content: This is the one to read. I even gave it to my husband to read. Easy to read. I read it in 2 hours. This book gave me the reasons people act the way they do. Then it gave me a way to talk to those kinds of people.	positive
title: A movie worth watching! [SEP] content: Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!	positive

title: By far my fave AC/DC!!!! [SEP] content: Overall this is a great live cd, it contains most of thier best and most populer songs. However the album doesnt really stick to you. By this I mean most of the songs get old fast but, still it's a great cd for any kind of AC/DC fan.	positive
title: Love this. [SEP] content: I love Maynard anyway. So, no matter if it's Tool or A Perfect Circle, I'm pretty much sold. I do like Undertow. However, 10,000 Days is my ultimate favorite Tool CD.	positive
title: Convicting [SEP] content: We do not live in the same world as the first century Christians that's for sure. Maybe if we lived in the Middle East but here in America it's a whole different story. I pray I never have to endure the pain and hardship the 1st and 2nd century disciples did. Though I long to be as spiritual and faithful as them. This book has some sobering challenges about how we live too materialistically. I know I could live without my stuff but it's like sin; once you've experienced it it's hard not to want it again. I don't miss living in mansions or having servants since I never did, but take away my indoor plumbing electronic entertainment and even just freedom to drive down the street and it's a real challenge to imagine getting by without. Thank God for all the blessings you have and never forget how good you got it. Now get out there and be spiritual. This book will help you do that.	positive
