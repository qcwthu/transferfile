title: Incomplete and poorly organized [SEP] content: I am currently taking a classroom course to get the MCSE, and the Global Knowledge Certification Press MCSE study guides are the books provided by the school. We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.	negative
title: it became too "old" [SEP] content: For me it sounds like bad Mercyful Fate. If u really like good prog check out latest works of Fates. Pleasant Shade is much much more creative and inreresting than this.	negative
title: DVD won't work, it says wrong universal code & won't play [SEP] content: I got this 4 my daughter 4 X-mas. It's the only movie she ask for, but when she tried to watch it, it wouldn't work. There is a message that comes up saying wrong universal code. What does this mean, never seen this before. So basically I wasted my money & now need to purchase a new one.	negative
title: Nice and simple. [SEP] content: Simple and easy to wear and adjust. Not much more to say except it is sturdy and durable and comfortable.	positive
title: Piece of junk [SEP] content: Item is a piece of junk. It looks pretty, but not capable of producing any significant amount of sound without clipping out. Started clipping at volume level 5 of 10. It would be consistent at volume level 4 or below which would be fine in a very small room with one person.	negative
title: barbie cali girl horses. [SEP] content: my daughter alison has had lots of fun with this toy.she says that it is really neat and that other girls will also have lots of fun with one as well.	positive
title: Great travel kit [SEP] content: I bought this to take with me on a trip to Germany. It comes with a lot of stuff and has room so that you can add a few extra things that you might need. The pouch easily fits into a backpack, messenger bag or purse.	positive
title: Hey, we gotta talk [SEP] content: well, i gotta say this is one of her better albums. I'm real is da bomb and so is the I'm real (murder remix) she and ja rule sound SOOOOOO fine together. Love dont' cost a thing is hott too but Play is almost a rip off of Madonna's music but J LO has a much better voice. well, im not gonna tell you to buy her cd but i highly recommend it cuz its so phat!	positive
title: The nicest kitchen out there, but I have had two things break! [SEP] content: This kitchen is the most realistic out there. We bought this kitchen for my 2 year old about 8 months ago, and it is holding up very well. I did a lot of research for a kitchen for my daughter. This one was the best for the money, and it is attractive. The only complaint I have is that the light no longer works, and the buttons for the oven don't work either. I am contacting the maker to see if I can get replacements. Overall a Wonderful Kitchen!!	positive
title: It Stinks [SEP] content: This game (....) it is really bad and is only for little kids and not older kids. This game has poor graphics, bad sound, and the worse control ever!!!	negative
title: Do NOT buy! [SEP] content: I backed up all of my .mp3 files, as well as many important files onto this product. When I got a new computer, I tried to access the files on this external hard drive and couldn't because I got a message saying the drive was not formatted. It IS formatted, by the same OS (Windows XP)! Now I cannot retrieve all the important files I had saved on this product.Do not buy this product!!!	negative

Villegas habla de las luchas en las que participo a lo largo de cuatro decadas, entre ellas la derrota en 1988 del ejercito del apartheid sudafricano en Cuito Cuanavale en Angola.

title: good story bad sound! [SEP] content: if you love telenovelas you must buy this one.it has everything suspense,love,hate,not to mention the chemistry between the actors.the only bad thing is the music,but after some time you get use to it.they cut a lot of scenes.but this soap opera has 100 episodes,so they cant fit it into 2 dvds.all the good parts are in.	positive

title: SEASON THREE, EPISODE FOUR [SEP] content: The fourth episode of this third season, DOUBLE EXPOSURE, was broadcasted on Dec. 16th, 1973. It's also possible to watch this episode in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete Third Season. AfterColumbo Collector's Edition: Dagger Of The MindandColumbo Collector's Edition: Requiem For A Falling Star, this is the third Columbo episode directed by famous director Richard Quine. It's also, afterColumbo Collector's Edition: Death Lends A Handand THE MOST CRUCIAL GAME, the third time Robert Culp impersonates the criminal in the serie.In this episode, Lt. Columbo must confound Dr. Bart Keppel who, during the projection of a commercial short film, murdered Vic Norris. Columbo, in front of an adversary specialized in the study of consumer habits, will have to use the same arms than Keppel to expose him.A VHS to keep in your library.	positive
title: A good historical novel from an interesting point of view [SEP] content: As historical novel go, this is fairly good and interesting. Set during the reign of Elizabeth the First, when Spanish Empire tried in vain to subdue England and privateers and corsairs scoured the seas, this novel takes the point of view of the eventual losers, the spaniards, through the eyes of an Irishman/spaniard nephew and assistant of the ambassador of Spain in England. In Ireland he will make acquaintance with a young disgraces son of an Irish Earl, Robin. They fall in love with eacxh other, but fate will separate them. They wuill see each other at sea, among battles, pirates and they will bot experience picaresque adventures in Spain. The historical part is fairly accurate, and whilst I think that the novel would have used some more editing, it remains a very good work. I've loved the disenchanted yet loyal Dermot channing and the brave, tender Robin.A great gay historical novel.	positive
title: too easy to break [SEP] content: We got this toy for my son. After 2 drops, the thing is not working. Now, which 1 or 2 year old doesn't drop toys? The manufacture should thought of it and makes the toy more durable.	negative
title: Not working well with the go-green CFL light bulbs [SEP] content: I have installed these in the kids play room. The bottom part of this fixture is too small to dispense the heat generated by a CFL bulb base. After a few hours, the CFL would get too hot and turn-off. Once I switched back to incandescent lights, then it is ok.The glass shades is definitely match the price of this product, not very high quality.	negative
title: Very dissapointed !!! [SEP] content: I've been on hold for over an hour on the live web queue; I started at #77 in line. While waiting, I searched searched the web for answers it appears that it's impossible for the device to recognize my internal 10.0.0.x addresses.I'm sending mine back.	negative
title: absolute lemon [SEP] content: I probably have as much experience with 11x17 capable color printers as anyone in the world and I've got to say this is easily the most difficult and unsatisfactory printer I have ever dealt with. HP's last 11x17 product (1220c) had amazing print quality, was faster, and lasted me for 3 solid years of heavy use. By contrast, the 9650 is MUCH slower for "best" print setting and MIND BOGGLINLY SLOW for its "maximum DPI" setting...try 35minutes for an 11x17 plot. Unacceptable. Not to mention that my printer is now broken and wont print at all.	negative
title: Reality is changing [SEP] content: this life experience related here by the author is not only common to him but many other persons all over the world, from all nationalities and social backrounds, including myselfe. It is something so personnal, such a big truth in our selfes, that the fact that it is not acepted by society does not even touches it's foundations of truth inside of you. It doesn't matter because YOU KNOW that it is your reality as much as you have five fingers in your hand. This book will help all those who are starting to become aware that there is more about this living existence of ours that people normaly think to grow into a more universal existence, where love is the engine of all things. Wonderfully fritning and simultaneously beautifull. A must for all those who want to know something more about our reality then it is said to be.	positive
title: Deeper than I thought [SEP] content: I initially bought this album because of Staind's acoustic songs, and skipped the rest. After further review, though, it is the other songs that keep me coming back for more. The depth and emotion expressed in this album is awe-inspiring. Listen to the entire album. Rock on.	positive
title: Nice but not outstanding [SEP] content: I was disappointed by the pictures in this book: they are nice but lack the originality and quality of an artful photographer. Since I am not a photography expert, I can`t elaborate about the mistakes or shortcomings of the photographer. As unknowledgeable about technique as I might be though, I know beauty when I see it. These pictures would be at home in a geography book or a travel guide: good but plain. Instead, I recommend "The Bridge of Turquoise" by Roloff Beny, a Canadian photographer. This book is full of magnificent pictures that please the eye and touch the soul like only the work of an artist can do.	negative
title: My Coffee Filter [SEP] content: I use this filter for every pot of coffee I make.I like to use a paper filter with it to "catch the fine stuff".It fits very well into a Proctor Silex 12-cup percolater.This filter does a great job.I would buy another.-Bob	positive
title: A must have album for any rock fan [SEP] content: As a long standing Kim Mitchell fan, this is his best offering. There is not a dud song on this album. A great mix of ballad-like songs and toe tapping rock beats. Kim is a genius guitar player and this album is a classic. If you ever have a chance to catch him in concert don't miss it.	positive
title: This is fun! [SEP] content: We had the VHS versions of Wallace & Gromit and enjoy them on Blueray. The new story is great! We can see the character development, timing, and production - all keep getting better. This is fun for kids and adults.	positive
title: Imaginary Friends [SEP] content: I didn't care for this book at all. I liked her other books but was disappointed in this one. Mary Pichette	negative
title: Ripped off [SEP] content: Xtremely dissapointed with the quality (or lack there of) like a vhs video that has been a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy (you get the drift) the colour in the colour dvd's is totaly washed out BUT as they say "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"	negative
title: Misleading marketing. [SEP] content: I don't know what the people who liked this movie are drinking cause the last time I looked up the word "horror" in the dictionary it didn't say anything about people standing out in the snow for 85 minutes talking until finally a cod-piece wearing devil deer comes running by at 60 mph (on his hind legs) clucking like a woodchuck.If the whole movie had been like that 5 minute deer part this would have been the funniest movie going but instead it was so boring I wanted to smash my face into the coffee table.	negative
title: Didn't work accurately [SEP] content: A nice gizmo, but did not read pressure accurately. Don't waste your time with this one. we went back to a manual pressure gauge.	negative
title: Arrived quickly and works great! [SEP] content: The Everpure Replacement Cartridge arrived very quickly and was exactly as promised at a great price.	positive
title: One page was the most useful [SEP] content: I got this to figure out how to do things digital as far as font creation. That was one page. A very lacking one page. I was very disappointed by very poorly composite pages with very unreadable sections. Makes the explanations of proper composition kind of hard to take serious.Honestly you can find better info for free on the internet. If only I'd known.	negative
title: how awful war is [SEP] content: despite some truth lacking details, this book represents a thourough look on this awful war..with so many forgotten incidents,it reminds us of so many tiny details that caused the big fire....really good for those looking for the truth....a must read	positive
title: Be pleasantly surprised. [SEP] content: Can you go wrong with Borodin? No.When performed well, the music of Borodin is almost sure to satisfy. His string quartets are considered highly...when they are considered at all. Listen for yourself. This is great stuff.	positive
title: Best of the Bunch [SEP] content: This is the best of the trail mixes in my opinion. No junk or candy fillers, very low salt, but enough to make it tasty, just the right balance between fruit and nut, with mostly nut, lots of kinds of nuts make it very nutritions. It is the perfect snack, which is hard for me to find since I have celiac disease (gluten intolerance).	positive
title: Interesting plot but lacks a catching ending [SEP] content: Clive Cussler has written numerous books with enchanting tales of hostile take-overs and non-stop action. The Serpent keeps the readers attention through out the chapters but in the end, lets them down. The 'bad guy' is taken care of within a couple of pages and leaves the reader lacking a substantial drama. i don't know if it is because Cussler has teamed up with Paul Kemprecos or if this was just a book that was slightly lacking. Cussler captures the NUMA spirit and does lead the reader into suspense and mystery. Overall, this book is a good choice for a Cussler fan.	positive
title: ...a very important and powerful tool [SEP] content: This is one little book that is worth it's weight in gold! The text not only defines words, it explains them too. Although it is a excerpt from the massive BARRON's HANDBOOK, this professionally bound soft cover book is easier to wield- it should be a part of every investors library!	positive
title: Isn't funny enough [SEP] content: I loved "Strangers with Candy" and I also love anything written by David Sedaris, so I figured a book by his sister Amy would be a stitch. It had some funny moments but for the most part this book was confusing. I'm afraid to try any of the recipes because I can't tell if she is being serious or not. I think maybe the recipes are real but the photos and things are DISGUSTING. I get that she intended for the book to be weird and gross because well... that's Amy Sedaris. But I just didn't find it very funny. It was too serious to be truly funny and too weird to be truly serious, if that makes any sense.I did get a tickle out of her descriptions of what to do for children's parties. That was kind of funny. The photos of the plastic food were just odd. I spent a good amount of money on the book and I threw it into my "books to donate" box as soon as I finished it.	negative
title: Absolutely Dreadful; immaturely written, juvenile plot! [SEP] content: This book never could have been published without the Higgins Clark surname. I have not encountered such drivel since I read as a child. In fact, an acquaintance who read the same book thought that perhaps it had been written for "young adults," however, I know of no teenager who would tolerate such inane dialog. I know I will never buy another. Grow up, Carol, and if there is a next time,try to write as an adult. Even the title is ludicrous!!	negative
title: Photos do not match the product shipped [SEP] content: I was told to get this item by my doctor because it would be the best support for my child. It has a tray adjustment which maximizes the usefulness for a child like mine. She has lower muscle tones. In the photo I can see the tray adjustment and it looks very supportive. When it arrived it was not as supportive and did not have the tray adjustment. It is not the same model. I have been in touch with Fisher Price. They acknowledged the item shown is discontinued. Their website too shows the discontinued item. Target and Wal-Mart do show the current item without the tray button.Fisher Price assumes there are discontinued versions in the marketplace but is unable to see retailer's inventory position.I was very disappointed in the distributor and Amazon for not displaying the correct item. Fisher Price offered me a full refund and is doing all they can to track down a chair internally.	negative
title: It didn't work at all...not even on a brand-new computer [SEP] content: When I first played The Sims, I thought it a wonderful game. I was in love with it. So when I received the expansion pack, I was ecstatic!However, once I installed it, (which was a long process in itself and it also gave an error message) the game would not work. I would start the game, on my brand-new computer, and the game would blank out my screen, then return me to my desktop. I tried over and over, but it was useless.I then had another problem...the riduculous people at Maxis made it so that in order to uninstall The Sims Livin' Large, you need to uninstall The Sims. This caused me to have to make backups of all my files, then have to reinstall The Sims and put my backups in the game.All in all, though the game is fun, (I've played it at friend's houses) it is not worth the trouble. Stick to the original.	negative
title: Floyd's Finest [SEP] content: Back in the good old Napster days, there were always a couple of live versions of the Atom Heart Mother Suite available which are also excellent. AHM is one of my top 5 favorite albums. I was around 12 when this came out. What a shame kids today can't discover new music in their childhood and have it with them for the rest of their lives.	positive
title: To far out for me [SEP] content: This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often "put on the shelf" when they become a bother in life...so sad. Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.	negative
title: Hanes over the calf tubes [SEP] content: The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase again	negative
title: The Best! [SEP] content: My daughter (who's 2 1/2 and has been watching them since about 18 months) absolutely LOVES these videos. She was hooked on Shapes and Colors and now is hooked on B-O-Zs and 1-2-3s! These videos convey healthy family relationships while teaching practical, everyday lessons. WithThank You God for Colors and Shapes, and with reinforcement from us as parents, my daughter has truly learned to see shapes everywhere and in every object...and on her own initiative. This particular video,BOZ the Bear Boz: B-o-zs and 1-2-3s,is great at reinforcing numbers and letters in a fun way. I even gave my daughter foam letters of her own name in an envelope (just like they do for the characters) so she could engage and learn on a more personal level. She constantly asks for this video by name. Because the characters are so loving and kind, it seems to have had an impact on her attitude as well. Two thumbs up for Boz!	positive
title: A promising beginning [SEP] content: A thoroughly enjoyable book with lots of action and plot twists. The characters vary considerably. I find Bek and Quentin unbelievably tedious and identical to the bland characters in other books. The parts focusing on them were rather dull. However others such as Walker, Truls and the Rovers more than made up for this and I would definately recomend the book.	positive
title: What a stinker! [SEP] content: Totally would not suggest this to anyone else - I would be too embarassed to recommend this movie to anyone.	negative
title: Bo Rocks [SEP] content: 10 times better now that he has the backing to make an outstanding cd.Can't wait for his full length cd this fall.Everything was very polished and full of energy.He was truly the American Idol.	positive
title: Prompt shipment [SEP] content: I still haven't had time to watch the video to comment about the quality, but it was shipped promptly and seems to be in good order.	positive
title: Poorly built [SEP] content: An Emei Piercer is supposed to have a washer. The washer is important. The washer makes emei piercer rotate without wobbling. Without the washer it can only wobble and makes the emei piercer worthless. DO NOT BUY this emei piercer.	negative
title: Great series [SEP] content: I love this series! I enjoyed watching it when it aired and I am really enjoying watching it again. I love that it is organized so you can pick episodes and even scenes to watch.	positive
title: Very inspirational and motivating [SEP] content: I have watched this DVD several times now because the story always supercharges my own motivation to eat correctly. I have not done the juice fast as the folks in the movie do but have followed their reboot program which you can find on their web site Reboot.com. It's a companion website to the movie and lays out the plan for you simply and delicously. They continue to motivate you with daily recipes and e-mails to keep you on tract. There's also a discussion forum for community support.I will be saving to do the juice fast when I'm closer to my goal weight because Dr. Fuhrman states that a fast, although healthy, slows our metabolism even after we end the fast. This is a great thing for longevity but not for weight loss.	positive
title: not made in USA - made in China [SEP] content: Boo - it's not made in the USA like it says on the website. Made in China right on the package. I feel duped.	negative
title: Excellent Resource [SEP] content: I have been looking for such a book for awhile. I'm an avid reader of historical fiction, especially medieval and Tudor novels. I wanted a resource that gave me quick information about a time period. This book fits my needs very well. In the few times I've used the book, I found it presents information in a non-biased way. With such information, I can put the novel's plot and characters within a framework.I would not buy it "new"; but found a "used" copy in very good condition... for a good price.	positive
title: Too hip [SEP] content: This book was a disappointment. The author seems to have pared down every line in some sort of quest for trendy minimalism. The content and interest in the scenes and dialogs are gone with this paring however. Kotler can evoke a locale at times with real style and grace, but too often you're left wanting a little bit more. All the characters act and sound as if they were at some prototypical silicon-valley milk bar, in their retro-hip fashions, hoping like hell to fit in with the coolist people there.Padre Isoceles's religious experience is the only truly hilarious scene for me in this book. A flash of brillance not equaled in the rest of the book.	negative
title: Voguestrap [SEP] content: It works great! I like my watch but the band broke. This replacement will let me get many more years of use out of my watch.	positive
title: really poor plugs [SEP] content: As usual, Palm doesn't improve with later versions. The sync and power plugs are much worse than the Tungsten E. They have plastic tabs and little metal prongs, and to put both in at the same time you have to force them together. I have had very bad luck with palm service under warranty so now I buy the cheapest I can and consider them "disposable". The Tungsten E2 does nothing to change my mind. No wonder they have no feedback button on their website, but I did fax them about the plugs. They are the worst I've ever seen and will break sooner rather than later. Also, after installing their new software which told me it had deleted some 3rd party programs that might not work, it still wouldn't sync without a fatal error every time. So their software isn't great, either. Wish I had another palm platform choice, other than a palm product.	negative
title: Sno-Line [SEP] content: This is a "B" movie, at best. But it was filmed in Beaumont, Texas, and several local sights and people are in it, including the late John Henry "Bones" Nobles and radio personality Gary Lee Love. It is an interesting movie if you are from the Beaumont area. Vince Edwards of "Ben Casey" fame, is the lead. Local school teacher Carolyn Linscomb, who plays a short scene as a housewife, has the most beautiful smile in the world.	negative
title: StarWarsEpisode1Book [SEP] content: My son enjoyed this book. It was an easy read for a 7 year old, with nice pictures and interesting facts. Probably perfect for a 5 or 6 year old.	positive
title: Not really impressed.. [SEP] content: This is the first Joy Fielding book I've read. It was easy to get into, the characters likable enough, and the plot slowly (especially in the middle) developing. However, the last 20 or so pages Fielding decided to throw the reader into a loop of unpredictability and confusion...there being only slight, slight hints of anything pointing towards such an unbelievable twist. I think Fielding took excess liberties as the author and had a really good time writing this story, but unfairly put the reader into a spot I don't think I'd want to venture again. And for all you fans of happy endings...don't expect to read "Whispers and Lies" and gain any sort of peaceful, satisfying resolution. It's just not here.	negative
title: The Jury's story [SEP] content: I wanted to hear about this from the Jury's perspective. Normal people who showed up for duty, only to have their lives turned upside down for a very long time.	positive
title: Good Ensemble Cast [SEP] content: Not a classic, but still fun to watch. Lemmon and Mathau are great, along with the recognizable character actors. Some very funny scenes with the psychiatrist and the escaped prisoner. Susan Sarandon has a small part as Lemmon's fiancee. (Pre Oscar days)	positive
title: Product is defective and has been replaced by Color Munki [SEP] content: Initially very excited to receive this product. Upon installing product and finishing calibration process, had a green tint to my monitor. After reading through all of the many reviews here on Amazon.com and via Google, I discovered that the "green" cast caused by this product was a very common issue.I called Pantone today to see if they had any solutions and was advised very promptly to contact Amazon to return the product. I was informed that the huey PRO product had been canceled and it was recommended by Pantone that I purchase the XRite ColorMunki product instead. Apparently the ColorMunki product replaced the inferior and problem plagued hueyPRO product.XRite ColorMunki: [...]I'm not willing to spend $170 on ColorMunki yet so I guess I'll just have to go with the color calibration tools that come with my computer for the time being.Disappointing, but as long as I get my money back from Amazon.com, I'm all good!	negative
title: Great idea in theory, see below: [SEP] content: Build your own patio furniture. While this sounds like a great idea, be mindful of the costs involved and also the longevity of the product.[...]Total cost: [...]- assuming you make no mistakes; and that the cost of the 2x4's are in this range. The problem I have with this is two-fold:1. 2x4 studs are not weatherproof. In time they will warp and crack and turn color. I would not consider pressure treated for obvious reasons and anything beyond that (Cedar, redwood or even the composite-plastic boards are phenomenally expensive). At that point, the price of this project will rival your aluminum patio tables.2. Maintenance - you will have to stain/weatherproof each year. These are added costs in maintaining the item.SUMMARY:Nice idea in theory. I love building things, however, save your money and INVEST a bit extra in an all aluminum patio table that will last a long time and not need continual maintenance.	negative
title: learn while you read! [SEP] content: I am a fervent reader of historical fiction, and this is definitely a book I praise - it's rare that you get such a thorough and accurate novel on Caesar - and interesting, too! McCullough brings not only Caesar to life, but Magnus Pompeius, Marcus Cato, Marcus Brutus, Calpurnia, Marc Antony, and others. I don't believe there's a part that she missed! Be fascinated, and learn, too!	positive
title: Good Grooming Kit. [SEP] content: Good shave, you can clean easily all parts.Not for body hair trimming.Battery is enough for many shaves.Nice!!!	positive
title: Great for babies and toddlers! New, innovative design [SEP] content: I had a See N Say when I was little and I think it is a classic toy for any kid. So of course when I had my baby boy I bought him one. I really like the new design. It is smaller and fits in little hands easier. My song loves 'flipping' the pages to hear the different animal sounds. The box says 18 months and up, but I bought it for my son at 6 months. I help him pull the lever and he loves to hear the sounds the animals make. I didn't buy this toy from Amazon though, I got it at my local store and it was a few dollars cheaper. Great toy!	positive
title: Save your money [SEP] content: This disk had two major problems. When the menu comes up, you cannot choose any of the items. Frankly I don't know what I did that made the dvd start, and when I tried to do it again, failed. The second problem is that even though there is only 1 and 1/2 hours of material on the disk, they used extreme compression, making the fast movements virtually unwatchable. Compression should never be used in sports or other fast moving subjects, as it obliterates any details. The "birth of an axe murderer" fight with Vanderlei Silva was very good to watch though, earning the disk a star.	negative
title: less than one star [SEP] content: I should have read the reviews. The time span for life of this product is about a month. I gave one to my mother for Christmas and it is already dead. Will not heat. I would give it less than one star.	negative
title: Bits'n'pieces [SEP] content: I think many of the reviewers of this release have their minds clouded by nostalgia and sentiment. Although Guaraldi's music is pleasant enough, the best tracks on this compilation have already been previously released, AND they're in good quality stereo. The previously unreleased tracks are in mono and are mere fragments: "Surfin' Snoopy" is barely one minute in length, "Joe Cool" two minutes. The tracks have also been assembled from disparate sources so there's no flow to the album, either, and a playing time of barely 37 minutes doesn't represent great value for money. In short, this album is not one you'll be playing out a lot.	negative
title: Good, but very vigorous [SEP] content: This is a very vigorous style of yoga. If you are looking for mainly stretches, go somewhere else. It you want to raise your heart beat, this is for you. After following the video for a few weeks, I now use some of the moves combined with some less energetic ones from other styles.	positive
title: Don't bother! [SEP] content: I have had nothing but problems with getting this magazine. Numerous emails to the publisher and clearly they have no idea what they are doing. Missed 6 issues straight. I wouldn't bother subscribing to this unless you enjoy getting a headache.	negative
title: One bulb failed in first day [SEP] content: It's a really affordable solution so I thought I'd give it a try. Evidently it was the last one they had because they had to hunt around for it to get it shipped (and I don't think it's available anymore). One bulb failed almost immediately but the other one is going strong and I'm not tearing apart the fountain over that one bulb.Vendor's got some pretty cool products, though.	negative
title: My Son's Favorite Toy But Nose Quit Working [SEP] content: Right now this is my son's favorite toy and he isn't the stuffed animal type usually. He loves this puppy and carries it with him, pressing its nose making it play the itsy bitsy spider and dancing to it. Its precious to watch. But today the nose quit working and he is so upset. He cried and doesn't understand why it won't work. I guess a wire had come loose in its nose. Now I have to buy another one because its his favorite. I only gave it four stars because of that. It is very heartbreaking when your child's favorite toy tears up.	positive
title: It's OK. I learned something watching these. [SEP] content: It is not a bad series. I just got bored after the first season, cause they were no hot women to watch here. All of these women looked so normal. And their characters were crazy! I don't deal with normal-looking AND crazy women in my real life, so I really couldn't get into spending my free time watching them either. Glad I bought this boxset on sale.	positive
title: what a pain [SEP] content: I didn't purchase this on the amazon website, but through a local pet suppy store. I was so excited until I actually tried to put this on my bike. To sum it up the metal parts were VERY, VERY poorly tooled. At first I thought I might have bought a defective item, so I took it back to the store. When I opened the second one I was shocked to see the same problem. The nuts were all scratched up and would barely fit over the bolts. The large nut only fit after about half a can of wd40 and A LOT of elbow grease from my boyfriend (LAME! because I am strong and shouldn't have to ask somebody to do it for me). I finally had it all attached and took my dog for a ride around the neighborhood. That part was okay. When I came home I tried to remove the pin, so I could ride my bike without the attachment. The pin would not come out! I had to take my bike apart to take this stupid thing off. Then I had to pound the pin with a mallot to remove it.Really really lame...	negative
title: Seasoned practitioners--don't bother [SEP] content: This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase "Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness" by Shakuntala Modi.	negative
title: TrippLite OMNI1000LCD Not Recommended [SEP] content: Worked OK while it worked, but no warning that battery was dying or dead. Tripp Lite website has nothing about replacement batteries, what to get, how to get it, or how to replace it. The manuals available for download on the Tripp Lite website are generic, apparently applicable to all Tripp Lite UPS units, with no photos or specific instructions about the OMNI1000LCD, nor, as I said, ANY info re: battery replacement.My recommendation: LOOK ELSEWHERE. (My replacement for the TrippLite OMNI1000LCD, with which I am very happy, is a CyberPower CP1350PFCLCD UPS 1350VA 810W PFC Compatible Pure Sine Wave, comparable price, better performance, pure sine wave.)	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: The sound effects are fine as long as the volume is not too high. I hoped the projected time would be something I could see without my glasses while laying in bed, but it was not.	negative
title: Fantastic Audiophile-quality Headphones for not a ton of money [SEP] content: Pros:-Everything sounds amazing-Blocks out most outside noise-Fantastic bass response-Long, durable cord-Comes with larger phono plug-Adjustable-Can be amplified quite a bit without adding distortion-Not $150+Cons:-After prolonged periods of listening, they really start to hurt the ears. It's like someone is tightening a clamp around my head.-Any music under the quality of a 256kbps 44.1kHz MP3 sounds degraded (but that's because it is). Time to upgrade your library to some higher quality MP3s, or better yet FLAC.Other Notes:-Despite the pain endured by listening to music with these, I still keep these on for much of the day. ERMERGERRRD, such sound quality.	positive
title: A FOOLS LED DOWN THE PATH [SEP] content: IF THEY HAD ANY GUTS THEY WOULD REPORT ON BUILDING 7 THAT COLAPSED FOR NO REASON OR HOW A GIANT PLANE FIT INTO A 20 FOOT HOLE AT THE PENTAGON, HOW AMERICA IS BEING DESTROYED, AND HOW THE FOOLS JUST GO ALONG DOWN THE PATH W/O A THOUGHT TOWARD TRUTH. wE LOST AMERICA-GOD FORGIVE THE BRAVE WHO CARE.	negative
title: No Names, Not Tributes [SEP] content: These are a bunch of no names in the goth metal and dance music era looking for a foothold to get them someplace higher. This is not a tribute. This is a bad CD even if you like goth metal, some parts are good, but then to balance it out some parts are bad for each track, such as the music is totally great, then the singer throws the song off like Star Fers Inc. Other songs the singer is good, but the synth throws the track off, but some songs are just ultimately bad.	negative
title: Cohen demonstrates that Canada's military is in Crisis [SEP] content: This critique of Canadian foreign policy will humble readers who are under the impression that Canada has a notable place in the world comparable to its illustrious past. Andrew Cohen gives us a brief overview of the history of Canadian foreign policy, dispeling several myths including our supposed past of being primarily neutral peacekeepers. At the end of ww2 Canada's military was the 4th largest in the world with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons if necessary. More importantly, Cohen reveals information about the state of the current military detachment in Afghanistan which makes one wonder whether our presence there is more of a liability than an asset to coalition forces.	positive
title: A product I couldn't do without [SEP] content: This was a replacement for a similar product that we'd worn out. It's something I can't do without. I've had one in my garage in 3 different houses since I've lived in Florida.	positive
title: Very good [SEP] content: I wanted to buy this film mainly for the music, as I when I married my wife, we danced with this theme	positive
title: fashion'useful'valueable [SEP] content: This pocket plus knife has more than thirty kinds of fuction,every one is useful and well designed. This one looks very beautiful and useful wherever inside or outside.	positive
title: Solid Debut [SEP] content: I rushed out to Best Buy to pick up the new CD I've been waiting for. It's a solid debut.There are only two songs I don't like. One of them is "Mirror", which is just too much sexual information for my tastes. I love "So Sick"(of course), "Stay", and "Sexy Love"(if every man talked like that it would be ALL good!)	positive
title: Try Another Movie, Dry at it can get in a movie. [SEP] content: Very slow & difficult stay interested in the movie.Acting was below par.Difficult to get past the first part of the movie.	negative
title: User Friendly lil Poddy [SEP] content: Bought this for my son to get used to a poddy chair. He is almost 2 and is curious about poddy training. This is nice because it is so low to the floor and easy to clean!	positive
title: Kai......Great scent..too bad it doesn't last [SEP] content: Just couldn't wait to get my Kai as I always have loved it when tried on in a store. I was delighted when I sprayed it on, but was very disappointed to realize that the lovely fragrance barely lasts til you reach the door of the house. Too bad, I won't buy it again for this reason.	negative
title: Great goal for home use [SEP] content: The instep disc golf goal is a great goal for home use. It stands sturdy without wobbling and is made with good materials. The quick connect pins make it easy to assemble and disassemble. An inner set of chains would help keep a few more shots in the basket (maybe 2 in 10 slip through). Also the top post section could be improved by adding a pin to secure it to the lower post instead of just fitting over it.Overall this is a great basket and I plan on purchasing another one soon.	positive
title: simply beautiful [SEP] content: This is not only a great book but also a engaging CD, and listening to the audio versions of her poems tends to make me emotional every time. When you begin to go through such poem as Daddy's Song and listen to it on the CD which features her actual father on the track, I guarantee you can't help but to cry. You can see a performance of it on youtube but it really is a distinctly different version, unfortunately excluding her Father.	positive
title: Just awful [SEP] content: Researched this book while pregnant and was horrified. We decided to do everything &quot;wrong&quot; (eat, sleep and play on demand), and our baby slept through the night at five weeks. She's happy, well adjusted and a delight both at home and in public.Please look into Dr. Sears' book before even considering this one.	negative
title: please! [SEP] content: I mean, with all the rockers on this album, why did it turn out so lame and predictable? Its basically Sound Garden. The songs are all forgettable and the ballads are too many and boring. You would think that this would be one of the greatest albums of the year? Cornells vocals are still mellifluous and amzing and Morello's guitar rocks............but it just doesnt combine well to make a great album..........boo hoo	negative
title: goLITE [SEP] content: I have had my goLite just over a month now and am very pleased with it. I can tell that it makes a difference in my moods already. Like any new habit, it is easy to forget some days. On those days that I have forgotten to spend my time "in the sun" (as I call it), I can see how much I need that light. If you suffer from depression and/or SAD, I urge you to try this light.	positive
title: Ugggh! [SEP] content: This was one of the worst "romance" novels I've ever read! It took the heroine waaay to long to warm up to her partner in this novel. While I like when there is some resistance, (don't care for weak heroines) I found myself irritated at every other turn of the page by her off putting attitude. In the end when she finally, finally acknowledges her love, after everything he'd done to prove himself,-I wished he'd left and gone his own way. I was so irritated that I just wanted to hurry up and finish and be done. The ending did nothing to stem the sense of disappointment and frustration experienced while reading this book.	negative
title: Slick vacuum but weak link in design [SEP] content: We loved this vacuum from the day it arrived until the day it broke. The cleaning head is held onto the arm by a tiny plastic C-clamp which locks into place with even tinier plastic pins. A few months of very gentle use and those pins came off. Electrolux has now agreed to send us a replacement clamp, but the service person on the phone made clear she would send just one and that this was a "courtesy". What about 4 months from now when the new one breaks? This is clearly a design flaw, and the manufacturer should include 5 or 10 of these things for the vacuum to still work a few years after purchase.	negative
title: Understand Your Finances [SEP] content: (this review is based on an earlier edition)Most of us have some gaps in our understanding of personal finances. This approachable guide lays it out briefly and understandably. Since my attention span is short for this topic, this is the kind of guide I needed.For instance, the two-page section on DEALING WITH A LENDER, shows a loan application form with 6 boxed explanations for parts of the form.You won't learn everything you need to know in two-page bites, but it gets you briefed on everything from mutual funds, making a will, getting insurance, understanding credit card statements, 401(k) plans, your W-2 form, etc.Once you grasp the basics, you can find a book specifically on wills or whatever you are dealing with at the moment.Gaining control over your finances can start with this book!	positive
title: great used buy [SEP] content: altough a more recent cookbook by vegetarian times has appeared and a more gourmet one, i got this on for 67 cents used on amazon what a great bargain.	positive
title: Not long enough [SEP] content: This game is fast paced and action packed. All the moves are easy, the versus mode is fun, controls are tight. 2 minor complaints: The game is too short, and the music leaves a little to be desired. But you'll be too busy fighting hordes of enemies to notice.	positive
title: Awesome!!! [SEP] content: Great product!! It's a well made crate. The bottom is plastic rather than metal, so it's not noisy at night when your dog moves or turns over while sleeping. The plastic is textured so your dog doesn't slip and it makes for easy clean-up for when accidents occur. Hands down one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon!	positive
title: Just plain AWFUL!!! [SEP] content: There are no other ways to explain this book but STINKY, PITIFUL, and AWFUL! I sure hope that if you buy this book you don't actually plan on fixing anything specific. The authors of this book raced through and tried to give as little detail about the repairs they were doing as possible.I will never own another Chilton's manual. I suggest you stick with the Haynes manuals. The detail is much greater, the pictures are MUCH better, and they actually tore down and rebuilt the vehicle in the Haynes manual.Please don't waste your money on this pitiful excuse for a repair manual!!	negative
title: Doesn't last long [SEP] content: This player didn't even make it a year before breaking down. Bought it in April & it no longer displays a picture & it's only November. The player was handled with care & no abuse. Bought other cheaper models that at least lasted a full year before problems began. Don't waste your money on this piece of .........	negative

title: Context is essential to proper interpretation. [SEP] content: The Wedge will collapse naturalism and thereby eradicate the most debasing and stulifying possible context that humans have created for some time now. Much energy has been spent engaging in rationalizations to keep this interpretatio of reality alive, but it will fizzle out because of its conceptual and evidential inadequacies. Truly it is sad that some humans, because of arrogance and selfishness, have devised a scheme that has reduced so many to little more than lusty, greedy herds of disoriented, distracted, disillusioned beasts, who are easily manipulated via flickering images on a screen, rapid beats from a radio. People don't live; they just exist, robbed of dignity, and have become little Caesars whose power is contained in a remote control - changing the world by a push of a button. Aid the Wedge!!! May it help us understand us.	positive
title: Great Little Device [SEP] content: I love this little thing! It keeps track of your steps, calories burnt and a lot more. Very easy to program and use.	positive
title: Exposing Schemes [SEP] content: The hours of research that the author of Psywar on Cuba must have spent in pursuit of the declassified US government documents pertinent to this book is a mission in itself. The bombardment of propaganda and psycological trickery that the CIA exercised against Cuba is all layed out thouroughly by Mr. Elliston. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Cold War madness. Additionally, the book contains some wonderful examples of leaflets and posters from the CIA's crusade that are sure to amuse and dismay!	positive
title: Not Strong Enough for me, good price though [SEP] content: I had to return this product despite of the good price (paid $29.99) because:1. not strong enough (the older model is stronger)2. too heavy3. too noisyBasically it didn't do what I wanted it to do.But it's pretty subjective.I read lots of good reviews about this, that's why I gave it a shot at the first place.	negative
title: Does not shed light! [SEP] content: Worthless! I purchased one for my daughter and it does not work at all. It has to be pitch black for the light to even be visible. We put fresh batteries in it but to no avail. She just needed a little help reading in our very dim living room but since you can't see the light it's more like a really heavy bookmark.	negative
title: Has a number of flaws [SEP] content: I received this mug as a gift and find it has a number of flaws. First, it doesn't keep the coffee hot as long as other mugs I have owned. Another problem, and most annoying, is that it does not provide "nose" space. When I take a sip, the tip of my nose gets squashed against the lid, and my nose is not at all large.As someone else mentioned, it has an interior lip around the upper edge and when you rinse it, water gets caught in there and dribbles back down when you set it upright, so there is always a puddle at the bottom. The only way to get it out is with a towel. The mug is narrow and it's hard to get your hand down in there. I am a woman and my hands are average size.The lid is hard to position, too. I will say that this mug is leak proof, but my old Nissan leak proof was far superior.	negative
title: Looks cool works terible [SEP] content: I have used almost every headset in the last week and the H700 looks better then any onther headset on the market but sounds the worst. I had static when my motorola v551 was in my pocket. Also had complaints of an echo on the other end. Went to the Plantronics Voyager 510, the best I found at least.	negative
title: "Vinicus en la Fusa" with Toquinho and Maria Bethania [SEP] content: This album was recorded in 1970 in Buenos Aires in a bar named "La Fusa". La fusa was maybe the creator of a bar-style in Buenos Aires called "cafe concert" where musicians would go and perform live; New Orleans style if you like but with latin american music. Vinicius on the other hand a fantastic musician was much appreciated in Argentina and so he went there many times. This record perpetuates a night of bossa in Buenos Aires with Vinicius Toquinho and Maria Bethania.	positive
title: facts? [SEP] content: I can only speak to one of the mine explosions discussed in this book, the Burton Mine Explosion at Craigsville, WV in 1958. Many of Mr. Dillon's facts were wrong in that chapter. I'd think the names of the miners killed would be easy for him to obtain, yet some of them were wrong. Makes me wonder about the rest of the book.	negative
title: Eloquent language and description, yet a contrived plot [SEP] content: I eagerly awaited this book and was ultimately disappointed. The descriptions of eastern Washington are absolutely spectacular. The way the story and descriptions of the landscape mesh reminded me of Wallace Stegner. Ultimately, though the plot seemed contrived and not particularly compelling. I hope the author comes up with a better plot for his next effort.	negative
title: Blaze this up [SEP] content: this album is crazy. good to blaze in the car or anywhere. could've been more crunk tho but still, that song wit Luda TITE.	positive
title: Oh my this book needs an editor [SEP] content: How this got published in its present form is surprising. The author repeats, repeats and repeats himself and at the same time contradicts himself as well. By the end of the book he is raving about redemption, a savior scenario and all manner of hell fire and brimstone.I usually re-sell books after reading them. This one is going into the recycle bin. I do not care to add this the the stream of morphic resonance.	negative
title: My kids like it [SEP] content: great purchase, my kids like it a lot, we all learn and read along. my little ones cant get enough of this dvd	positive
title: good title because you will sleep through it [SEP] content: What a huge disappointment! We thought this was to be more informative. It was just a whining girlfriend ( no point to her being part of this dvd) the experts in this dvd was the only reason to watch it	negative
title: Excellent [SEP] content: I have this pda for about 6 months now and i love it. I had a sony clie before this which went dead on me so i was in the market searching for another pda. The sole reason i went for pocket pc rather than palm os was the wifi capability (Now i think palm os also offers wifi?) e805 has built in wifi but is more expensive than this one and is heavier also (bought this one cause its cheaper than 805) so what i did was bought sd wifi card and voila! i m online. This unit is thin, light and beautiful. You can easily carry it in your shirt pocket and wont be bothered by its weight or size. Screen is bright enough, no problems there. The only reason i have given it 4 rather than 5 stars is cause sometimes it would hang on me and i would have to reset it. Now i dont know if its all pocket pc which do this or is it some software glitch , so i thought would take the rating down a bit. All in all its a good one and is recommended. I wanted a well lit bright screen for my pda which this one has.	positive
title: Did not work [SEP] content: I bought this remote for my Rebel XTI hoping for a remote that would at least take pictures...remotely. I read a few reviews from customers that were happy, but also from some that said theirs didn't work. Well, i decided to take a chance on buying it since it was inexpensive compared to the Canon remotes, but it turned out that I was one of the unlucky ones. I've tried everything and even replaced the battery, but I just couldn't get it to work.So my conclusion is this, if you don't mind wondering if you'll actually get a working product, give this one a go. If you want to be sure of what you're getting however, pay the extra money and get the Canon.	negative
title: Great! Super easy to use. [SEP] content: I, or rather Santa bought this mp3 player for my son (5 years old) for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! The ear buds NEVER leave his ears. It was VERY easy to teach him how to use. He likes how small it is, it just slips easily into a pocket. So far it's stood up to the constant dropping and abuse from him with no problems. It charges fairly quick and keeps a charge for about 12 or so hours. Im not sure how many songs it holds but he has about 30 two or three minute songs on there now. I would definitely recommend this mp3 player because it cheap and reliable.	positive
title: A well-crafted Werewolf story [SEP] content: A tense story for it's time, full of neat plot twists and capable actors. The only gripe I have is that the Werewolf in question is mainly just a big Wolf-Dog, yet they handle it rather well, but despite that it's still a really well-made story. The protagonist is an interesting "grey area" type of character, straddling the line between anti-hero and anti-villain. Wish they had made more movies with him.	positive
title: Honestly, I am baffled. [SEP] content: The NinJew is billed as "Philosophy - Spirituality - Humor - Action - Adventure." It is a self-published 84-page paperback which jumps wildly from an adventure tale to a workout guide to a nutrition workbook. The text is accompanied by low resolution black and white images of the use of gymnasium equipment and the real-life adventures of the NinJew. Author Richard Walters has promoted his book via a campaign of [...] Friend Requests.The workout and nutritional information are well-founded and easy to follow, but there are plenty of easier-to-use books on the market. The adventure is just weird beyond belief, and the text is smattered with references to G-d and his great Omnimax theater. If you in author Richard Walters's inner circle of friends and family, this is probably a wickedly funny book, but as an outsider, well, I am just baffled. This appears to be a fun gag and nothing more.	negative
title: Good [SEP] content: If you remember watching these reruns in the 70's and 80's and have not seen them since - this is a treat... Just don't expect to sit down and watch more than 3 or 4 in a row... They are good, just a little repetitive.	positive
title: 4 weddings warmed over [SEP] content: I just sat down and watched Notting Hill again to try and see what I missed the first time. Result: Nothing. It is a warmed over (well slightly overdone) Four Weddings and a Funeral. However the latter film had better writing and casting. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts anyway, but the sister in Notting Hill was a feable attemt as was the "Bernard" Character. The only asset Notting has over 4 weddings is the soundtrack. That was a greatly missed opportunity.	negative
title: helps sciatica pain [SEP] content: I have arthritis and sciatica and found these exercises make me feel better. When I first did them, I thought some would cause me pain later but it was the exact opposite -- they reduced pain. Great stretching exercises.	positive
title: Frequently cuts off incoming messages [SEP] content: I've had this machine for around a year. It seemed to work OK at first, but lately it has been cutting off the incoming messages long before the maximum message length. Seems like if the person who is calling you speaks softly, it will cut them off.	negative

title: 5 Qt. cast iron Dutch Oven [SEP] content: Great price, free shipping. Fantastic for simmering soups and stews. Even used it for cooking a pork loin roast in the oven. Love it... Non-stick...	positive
title: Minimal crunchy sexy [SEP] content: There is something unmistakeably compelling about The Kills. VV & Hotel have a palpable chemistry on-stage that translates beautifully in the studio. There's this raw, urgent, detached energy to their sound that digs right into the soul of Garage Rock. VV's voice is clear and sensuous and Hotel has this sort of hoarse sexy whisper that compliments her perfectly.The fact that they choose to use a drum machine may feel incongruous to some rockers out there. I know it did to me at first. Yet as I've kept coming back to their stuff, I realize that it's part of their 'mystique' and definitely, for me, since there's no one else to compete with, makes this duo even hotter on stage."Keep On Your Meanside" will forever be embedded in my mind and heart, but "No Wow" will keep me going until I can see them live again!	positive
title: Rolo Chain [SEP] content: The chain is exactly as stated in description. It is sturdy and looks very nice. There was some confusion about the shipping service due to a miscommunication from the seller, but this did not affect the time in which we received the chain. We still received it very quickly. Thanks!	positive
title: I don't get the "picture" [SEP] content: As a new teacher, I am constantly searching out new and interesting ways to present material to my classes. Since grammar is particularly boring to students, I bought this book in hopes of finding some new, exciting way to teach it. Instead, I got a book with lots of theory but no real "practice", and a cd-rom that has pictures I could have obtained from the web myself. Noden has a wonderful idea, but he seems to have left out the most important chapter in his book: HOW TO USE IT! In addition, there is little said about the part of grammar we all have trouble teaching--the rules. Most of this book relies on content and revision of WRITING, instead.I like that idea, but with the burden of standardized testing, students need to know the rules behind the revisions, too. If you have time to come up with your own ways of using Noden's great concepts, get the book. If you don't, wait for him to come up with a practice manual.	negative
title: little package with a big result!!! [SEP] content: I saw the price and figured, I will try it, its not a lot of money. Well, you HAVE to get one of these!!! It vibrates faster and more intense than anything I have in my goodie drawer so far!! I love how its so compact too so I can take it with me when I travel. My boyfriend also likes how happy it makes me!!! I had several orgasms with it and he had better orgasms too since I was so hot inside!!!	positive

title: so far great,but sharp blade. [SEP] content: I received this as a gift and so far it works wonderfully. I chopped up small chunks of asiago cheese, whizzed it around about 5-10 times and "instant grated cheese" !Very handy for chopping walnuts and making dips too. The only warning is that you MUST be careful of the extremely sharp blade. In order to change the setting from "course chop" to "puree", you have to flip the blade over, and it is very easy to slice your finger "even if" you're being very careful. To prevent this, try wearing oven mitts or heavy-duty leather work gloves(from any hardware/home improvement store).	positive
title: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! [SEP] content: I remember watching this film when I was about 5 or 6 - my mother mistakenly assumed that this was a children's flick from the cartoon rabbit adorning the video sleeve. I couldn't sleep for weeks after seeing this movie - it certainly made me see rabbits in a new light. Years later, I decided to watch it again, as I had matured and was apt to scare so easily. Instead, I still found it to be a sick movie that sends shivers dowm my spine.	negative
title: 1 Step toward Commercial....But worth it [SEP] content: This is F2F's 3rd release. The first track is one of their best (I've never heard it live) "Resignation". This is the first song that got me into Face to Face. It goes right into a very commercial "Walk the Walk". "I Won't Lie Down" is one of my favorites. Great live song as well. The rest of the album is good as well. The best track on the album in my opinion is track 10. "Complicated". Another great driving song. An amazing live song. For the new fan who is a little timid of the hard stuff....This one is a perfect choice.	positive
title: Shallow [SEP] content: What a disappointment. The facts are slim. Old movies are passed off as representations of the crimes. In the Jack the Ripper segment, for example, we have lengthy scenes from inaccurate 1930s films. But by far the worst is the stupid music (that screech from "Psycho") and the even stupider, more banal narration.The "experts" who tell us about the killers are strutting, preening dolts who think that putting a label on something (e.g., the urge to kill) explains it. The killers are psychopaths, sociopaths, we hear from the self styled scholars of crime. So what? That doesn't explain anything or add one iota to our understanding. It would be better to leave all that out and just give the facts. I've seen TV programs that do a far better job of telling what happened.Skip this set of DVDs. Someone will surely do this subject better.	negative
title: Suspense [SEP] content: This book kept my attention (on the edge of my seat, attention) from beginning to end!If you like a suspenseful mystery, it is a must read.	positive
title: What would you think of a guy who... [SEP] content: What would you think of a guy who is directly involved in a major Washington scandal, the Plame affair, reports upon the affair as if he even could be an objective news source, failing to inform his viewers and readers of his role testifying before the Plame Grand Jury? How about a guy who promotes his own son's radio sport's show on Meet The Press without telling his viewers that it's own son that he is promoting? How about a guy who is Dick Cheney's personal Mr. Potato Head, wears "Bush/Cheney for President" buttons on the underside of his suit lapels, and then flashes the buttons at Washington cocktail parties like he WAS the dancing girl in the pasties??? Well, you get the picture...and now this Republican mole in television's Dick-bird seat on Sunday mornings writes a quaint little book about how his propensity for foping his family and servicing the Administration is the greatest thing since his daddie! One star, but only because I can't choose zero stars.	negative
title: Oh my God can someone please end thier lives now?! [SEP] content: This is the worst show ever. And you know what the funny thing is? I didn't even watch the show. Britney Spears needs to just shut the hell up. She isn't hot and she isn't funny. All she is is just trailer trash. and her dumba** of a husband should be thrown in Compton of East L.A and see what a real gangsta is. I feel sorry for thier kid that he has to live with these retards. I hope that one day they get what they deserve. If anyone honestly buys this DVD, and likes it, you shouldn't be allowed to live. If anyone buys me this, I am going to destroy it right in their faces and tell ask them what they were on when they bought this. Please God, do something about all these celebrities who think they are Gods.mr.eleFantZero stars. I hate how we have to put one star even if we absolutely hated it.	negative
title: WORST MICROPHONE EVER!! [SEP] content: I strongly suggest not to buy this product because for 1 these are terrible sounding and for 2 they are cheep looking. Im disappointed in this product they could have done a lot better for what they call a "Professional Microphone". Im curious on what their non professional microphone sounds like...?	negative
title: Again no magic!! [SEP] content: I am sorry, but I have to join those who did not rate 'Again the Magic' by Lisa Kleypas too highly. I never thought I could give any book written by Lisa 2 stars, but there you have it...I kept waiting for the book to come alive, make me laugh, make me gasp, but it did absolutely nothing for me! It was boring, and for a 391-page book, there was (IMO) absolutely zero conversation between the hero and the heroine. They had no spark, they were not happy....what a couple! Now there was a secondary romance story between Livia and Shaw- not that their story was great too, in fact for the first time ever, I didn't enjoy having extras in a book! However I liked Shaw much more than McKenna. I'm sure this was a one-off and hope the next Lisa Kleypas book I read turns out to be much better than this. Still love her books. Go Ms. Kleypas!!	negative
title: Hated this shaver [SEP] content: I have been using electric razors for years due to very sensitive skin & thought I would try something new. The reviews I read online of this Panasonic model were mostly favorable, so I figured I'd give it a try. BAD IDEA!This razor gave me a horrible shave (wet using a soothing lather). I had to keep going over & over the same spot repeatedly, it irritated my skin almost immediately, and it was very loud. I never got a close shave, no matter how many times I went over the same area & so I gave up after about half an hour of trying. My 5-year-old Remington shaver with a used blade gave me a smoother shave than this brand new, never-been-used shaver!	negative
title: spies [SEP] content: The book Point Blank was a pretty good for me.I would rate this book a four.The thing I really like about this book is that it had alot of technology and cool thing.This guy name Micheal J. Rosoe is one of the character. Micheal is very rich.He is a spy for the F.B.I. My favorite thing that Micheal J. Rosoe was a custom-made meredes with reinforced steel plate and bulletproof window. Another character is Alex Rider,a fourteen-year-old spy.alex is stuck in a broardingschool and he is trying to not get caught.I really like this book.I think anyone would like this book,if they like high technology and spying.I think i want to read more of this author books. written by William G.	positive
title: mano! negra! ya! ya! ya! [SEP] content: The final and most mature effort from Mano Negra, basically driven by Manu Chao before he went solo and ironic for that fact since it is so much more rock and electronic than his subsequent solo work. Mano Negra were a great, interesting, rocking band that were entertaining as well as thought-provoking. Some people have called them 'the latin Clash' and there are definitely similarities although the Mano Negra were obviously on the scene a little later. A great album for fans, but as others have noted, maybe Puta's Fever would be a better initiation to the band.	positive
title: Great Product [SEP] content: I think this is a great product to prevent razor bumps and to clear up your skin. The only thing I don't like is the smell. But it is worth the results.	positive
title: Fair [SEP] content: Dr. Barbara Kirwin draws on her years of experience as a forensic psychologist to talk about some of the the most eyebrow-raising cases of the past 20 years where the insanity defense was used and abused.She has seen a lot in her line of work and readers will appreciate her insider's view, but too much of this cheap book is a wordy and repetitive diatribe against the criminal justice system. Her memory is keen and I do not question her credentials as a psychologist, but she is neither philosophical nor wise enough to be a social critic. Much of the book is like listening to a child whine about a denied sundae.	negative
title: Needless Tampering with Script Mars Movie [SEP] content: Absurb tampering with a superb tale mars what is one of the best detective novels ever written. Unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, you'll want to skip this version. The best version si Basil Rathbone's 1939 version, if you can get over the fact that it's in black and white. Otherwise, Jeremy Brett's version is for you.	negative
title: Great system for testing water quality for aquariums [SEP] content: Product does exactly what it advertises. Some tests are easy to conduct, while others require that you don't lose the instruction guide (i.e. add 10 drops of chemical A, shake and wait 5 min then add 10 drops of chemical B, shake and wait another 5min). Tubes are sturdy and won't break easily when dropped; I have dropped two already and the cap stayed on, no water spilt and no damage to container. The color guide is a little difficult for me to read, since I partially color blind; but with a little aid from my wife there is no issue. I love the fact it comes with a regular ph test and a high ph test. Since goldfish like it a little above 7.5 then it is alot more useful when getting the ph perfect for them. I keep Red Ear Sliders as well and all 9 are health and have not had any issues with water quality since I got this kit.	positive
title: PSEUDO MILLER [SEP] content: Bob Chester was and still is criticized for being a carbon-copy of the Glenn Miller sound. His band is actually quite good and because we haven't heard his records umpteen times, his stuff is actually more fun because it's like hearing something brand-new for many big band enthusiasts. "Cuban Boogie Woogie" and "Octave Jump" are very good and Dolores O'Neil (as a trivia note, she was related somehow to the great Eugene) was a vocalist with an original, rather strong voice and her vocals hold up better than say, Marion Hutton's (I never thought she could sing worth a dime).	positive
title: How to Handle Adversity [SEP] content: It gave me a whole new outlook on suffering and how to handle it. I always want to glorify God. I have a daughter with MS. It has helped her thru her many struggles along with her strong belief!We serve a great God!	positive
title: BROKE 2 TIMES!!!!! [SEP] content: I registered for this when I had my son. The metal base broke at the bend from the floor base. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. 2 years later i had a daughter, put together the replacemnt. she is about 6 mths old, 12 lbs and the replacement broke in the same spot?! and just from my daughter rocking it herself, kicking her feet. Be careful.	negative
title: NOT BAD - BUT NOT WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED TO BE! [SEP] content: I've had mine for a week and it ain't what its cracked up to be. Cannot get the top to fully lock down therefore I am unable to "Self clean". For a normal litterbox - which this is essentially is because of the problem - it is WAY overpriced.	negative
title: Garbage [SEP] content: I have been an Act! user from the beginning, and this software is terrible. Everything said about this piece is true. The **ONLY** positive feature is that it installs a new version of Act! and leaves Version 6.03 alone. That way, when you get frustrated and remove the software, you can go back to your old version. If you have a Palm Treo device or Windows Mobile phone - forget the sync and forget the sync'ing with third party software. This thing is SLOW and will drive you nuts. DO NOT BUY IT. RIP OFF. You'd think they would test this stuff with some previous owners and get some real feedback. Geeze	negative
title: Not good for mushrooms [SEP] content: This slicer is advertised as an egg and mushroom slicer. However, I have gone through 4 of them in short order trying to slice fresh white and baby portabella mushrooms. If mushrooms are what you need to slice, I would try the professional model.	negative
title: Won't fit my 1 1/2" tabletop. [SEP] content: I really should've read the reviews on this, but I didn't see how I could go wrong. It's described very well and the pictures really sell it. I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet. There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present. For now, I am content with the bumbo. Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping.	negative
title: Irish Spring not original formula [SEP] content: It's a pleasant fragrance but it's not close to the original.Recently, my wife bought me a pair of Irish Spring Body Wash liquid containers. My love affair for Irish Spring was born again. It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance. Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip. It was time to get more.This time, however, I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring. Yes, I'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However, the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original. Not even close. Yes, it's the same striations of various green hues. And it's a pleasant fragrance which I really don't know how to describe.My suspicion? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring.	negative
title: This world has no room for Wide-ees. [SEP] content: Shoe sellers should have a unit of measurement for width. Inches and centimeters are only charted for length. I really, really don't think the average consumer knows whether they wear a 4A, M, C, 5E, etc. Most shoes in this world do not come with width labels! So, even though a slip on canvas was exactly what I wanted, I could only gamble at the limited selection of colors and sizes. I lost.	negative
title: really like the price [SEP] content: My vet put my dogs on this and the price at the vets was as much as these for 50 tablets. What a difference. Exspecially when my dogs will be on them forever. I can save a lot of money as still take care of my dogs.	positive
title: Best Calcium Supplement! [SEP] content: I'm very happy with this product because it has all the right vitamins in the right ratios to increase the bioavailability of the calcium. It's also a great price. Thanks!	positive
title: Not what you expect. [SEP] content: Some of the pictures were extracted from the movies and series.But they are smeared or otherwise distorted. Maybe for copyright reasons. But the other pictures are drawings/prints of paintings.There are so many other pictures they could have done. There areso many other ships. This calendar is not worth the time or money. make your own calender with pics off the web.	negative
title: Disappointing. [SEP] content: I love Ms. Kinsale's writing, don't get me wrong. My favorite character's are her creations-intelligent, human, far more intricate than norm-but these two just didn't add up. I felt sorry for them. The heroine had shown such promise in the beginning. What really bugged me, though, was there were periods of time when years pass and they didn't even see each other. It's just the next paragraph, and oh, they're together again. The plot twists were so offsetting and unbelievable. Or maybe this is just one of her earlier books, written before historical romances became less of an I hate you, I love you, let's get it on genre.	negative
title: Tease of tech [SEP] content: This movie arrived in good condition. The movie was a great teaser of the nature of tech and the issues that arise from loosing the human aspect of relationships.	positive
title: Magnificent! [SEP] content: The last installment to Night Angel 9 is just what I thought when I bought it. Peter has done a great job job in writing how they work and carry out their job. Great Job!	positive
title: It's cute [SEP] content: I didn't buy this for a child to play with but more as a keepsake because of the puppet's name so I can't really say how durable it is. I can say that it is well made for a puppet and really is adorable.	positive
title: Excellent readl!! [SEP] content: I thought that this book was very entertaining. It had an interesting plot. I liked the way it switched between the killers point of view and the cops. The torture scenes were a bit gruesome and they had me twisting in my chair in discomfort, but isn't that what a good novel should do? It made the horror of what the killer was doing to these men seem that much more disturbing and made the reader really want the cops to succeed in stopping the killings. I was up until 2:30 in the morning the other night and I couldn't put it down, even though I had to be up early for work. I really like the characters in this book (Jordan, Hill, Merrick). I first picked up The Torment of Others in the Charles de Gaulle airport having never heard of the author. I so enjoyed that novel and the characters therein, that I went and purchased all of McDermid's novels with these characters. The Mermaids Singing did not disappoint, and I look forward to reading the Wire in the Blood.	positive
title: programmingglitch [SEP] content: If you want to do some professional programming this book is almost a waste. It is very basic. VERY BASIC. Doesnt answer any of the basic questions. Okay. With MFC and SDI and MDI and all the supposedly cool and hyper smart stuff we at least hope to go beyond writing codes in SDI and MDI for saying "Hello World", and typing three stings as a document file. If that is supposed to be smartness....god save the world. No Help. With anything. Wont help you write a windows application. Unless ofcourse, you are the hello world kid. And get an ego boost once your hello world works!	negative
title: Hogue Grip [SEP] content: Grip was supposed to fit a Glock 19 but didn't. I tried to trim it, last thing I wanted to do, but it just got worse. I have other Hogue grips that fit perfect but not this one. Threw it in the trash.	negative
title: Flesh Number One [SEP] content: He stole the show when he opened for R.E.M., and I've been a fan ever since. This album epitomizes Robyn Hitchcock's style: jangly, funny, refreshing, and clever. This album has a sort of mystical air to it, broken only by visualizations of fat men, floating and and then exploding, leaving debris of skin and lunch leftovers on your sleeve. For me, highlights include the fun 'Tropical Flesh Mandala', 'Balloon Man' of course, and the nice little perfect pop number, 'Flesh Number One (Beatle Dennis)' which illustrates that when Robyn sets out to write something meaningful and a tad bit commercial, he can still do it without compromising.	positive
title: Too much politics, not enough action [SEP] content: This book was extremely disappointing. Besides being the typical Michael Stackpole style of 1% mech action and 99% boring politics of the inner sphere, this book felt like somebody said "I'm bored with the Clans, let's get rid of them and start something else". The casual way that the inner sphere defeats the Clans to stop the invasion left me thinking that Stackpole or maybe FASA just want to end it. So what are the Clans to do now??? Their whole reason for being has melted away, and with barely a tremble from the khans. This book just doesn't jib with the BattleTech universe. Skip it!	negative
title: Finally! [SEP] content: Finally a book about cottages that was well written, witty and you can really tell you are dealing with a writer that has a true aesthetic of a variety of designs. I love cottages, and have been lucky to lovingly restore three in my life. This book might just inspire me to get started on working on another. Great book!	positive
title: Outdated series of advertisements [SEP] content: This book is little more than a series of plugs from biotech firms trying to sell their technologies. It's seriously outdated anyway, so don't bother.	negative
title: this product does not include USB interface [SEP] content: Hi,I am so surprise to find that this product does not include USB interface as its specification describe.Only provide a parellel interface.As far I can not find a suitable interface for my laptop. I think it is better that Amazon provide an option to customer to select, or clearly tell customer the default config of the interface.Anyway,my printer can not be used now.	negative
title: It's about time!!! [SEP] content: Finally, one of the best series of the 80s makes it to DVD!!! I loved this show growing up, and watched it again when one of the cable networks started running the series. And unlike so many of the shows that I thought were "so great" when I was young, this one withstood the test of time for me. The actors, the stories, the interaction and by-play between Rick and AJ, everything. Yes, there are some "iffy" episodes (what series doesn't have them?), but overall, this is a solid series that has been FAR too long in making it to DVD.	positive
title: More serious, but not up to the name in depth. [SEP] content: God Emperor of Dune is a thought-provoking book. It is certainly the most philosphical so far, and portrays an implausible though fascinating picture of humanity in which deliberate oppression manipulates society. It is about the use of power, the danger of seeking absolute truth, and the importance of rulers retaining compassion for humanity and individuals. I went through the book quickly and could not put it down, mostly because I was fascinated by Leto II--an extremely complex character which I have come to think of as Herbert's idea of the mind of evolution itself, though with some traces of humanity. The dialogue is also fascinating. When I finished it, I felt like I had read a study of power in all its forms, with a plot thrown in as an afterthought, so I could't rate it very highly as a novel.	positive
title: More like 4.5 stars. [SEP] content: GYBE are basically a neo-progressive band and thus they tend to be a bit too pretentious... but I don't care a fig whether they pose as indie snobs as long as their music is this good. This EP consists of two "suites" (the term "track" or, worse, "song" is definitely inapplicable), both of wich build up terribly slowly, so slowly that in fact after a while you'll end up wishing they adopted a faster pace but that, again, brings us back to the pretentiousness business. The instrumentals are wonderful, sometimes they have an epic flavour, other times they're both soothing and evoking. Well, needless to say, this is music that shouldn't be listened to before 8 PM, you wouldn't get in the mood otherwise... if you love ambient pop and post-rock you can't definitely miss this release (also try their latest effort) !P.S. Try something by Rachel's, the Dirty Three and Silver Mount Zion.	positive
title: Dehydrator [SEP] content: During the holiday, Grandma has a special recipe for beef jerky, my original dehydrator was dropped, and was broken, so I had to get another, so Grandma could make her special beef jerky, and I search the internet, and found that amazon.com had the best price for what I was looking for, and it was delivered on time. Thank You for making my holiday a special one.	negative
title: made me die a little inside [SEP] content: watching this movie made me stare outside of my window picturing me jumping outit made me wonder if i was ever a prisoner in a country somewhere if it would be used for torture,i concluded that it would be okay to watch it after a couple of days in prisonthe movie starts off allright, the music when that silly guy walks was quite hilarious,although the acting was pretty bad where the girl gets lost,the movie then starts getting confusing when the guy with the hands outfit starts talking to the rockit hurts my stomach just remembering this filmhowever i will be buying a copy for my friend,i can already picture his face	negative
title: Much better than Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper [SEP] content: My little girl is not a big Barbie fan, but she loves this movie. She is 4 and is horse-crazy right now. She has watched this movie over and over again. She watched Princess and the Pauper once.This movie is worth the money. It comes with 3-D glasses, but watching the show in 3-D is optional.This is a great movie for a young girl who loves horses, likes to dream, and reinforces the idea that girls can be strong, competant heroines.	positive
title: buckwheat pillow [SEP] content: I have a severe sensitivity to odors. They trigger my asthma. In all the write ups about buckwheat pillows, I never saw reference to the fact that buckwheat hulls have quite a strong smell to them. Therefore, I was never able to use the pillow. When I inquired about returning it, there was such a large fee involved that it really was not worthwhile packing it up and shipping it back. The advice I got was to empty out the hulls and let them air out. I had already done this....it has been several months since I started airing them out and the smell is still too strong for me to tolerate. I'll give it some more time, but had I known about the odor, I certainly would never have ordered the pillow.	negative
title: Great Carpenter Jeans [SEP] content: Extremely happy with the quality of these jeans. My husband immediately noticed and loved the leather addition, which protects the jeans from the use of tools. And besides that, they look good too!	positive
title: Get hooked on the doctor!! [SEP] content: I saw some of the shows on tv from different seasons and decided to watch it from the first "new doctor". I have to say I was so glad that I bought the series, I get to watch them whenever I want to. The stories are so good this is what family entertainment is all about. There is no season I don't like.	positive
title: Fast but crashes frequently [SEP] content: This sped up my graphics, but after installation, my computer crashed frequently. I had to replace it with the old video card just so I could use my computer.	negative
title: Pure Talent.... [SEP] content: After reading the obviously favorable reviews of this cd and really liking Grouch and Eligh's No More Greener Grasses, I had to order it from Amazon. WOW. Awesome lyrics and enough intricate, bass heavy tracks to please anyone. Like other's have said, if all you know is Chingy and Nelly, well, chances are you might not "GET" this album. I won't say you won't like it because even if you don't understand it at first, the more you listen to it the more it will grow on ya. I consider this one of the best hip-hop cd's I own and that's saying something considering the size of my predominantly underground collection. You will not be disappointed if you pick this cd up off Amazon. Do it. Rep these skilled cats and let people know who the real mc's are.	positive
title: Nightfire 007 [SEP] content: Fun, exciting game with james bond atmosphere sounds, graphics and weapons. This was fun, except it was way to hard, even on the normal setting. Characters appear very grainy and it was to tuff to tell who was the bad guy. Very frustrating game with no save points until the end of the level. I would always get to the end of a level, then die, and have to spend another twenty plus minutes to get to the end again. The characters bounce around to quickly, and it takes numerous shots to put them down, even about three head shots before they die. I finished it with cheats. For unlimited ammo - pause then R - left - L - right - Up - Select - right. For Unlimited health pause then R - left - L - right - Up - Select - left. Level select pause then R - left - L - right - Up - select - R. Good luck, you'll need it.	negative

title: Bought TaxCut instead - doesn't require activation [SEP] content: I was a loyal Turbo Tax customer until I found out this year that they have implemented an annoying product-activation system, which doesn't allow you to easily install the product on more than one pc at home. I have a laptop AND a 2 desktop pcs at home, so the product activation headaches make it not worth the purchase.I purchased TaxCut instead and it is terrific, does the job, doesn't have the annoying problematic product-activation, and I will be a loyal customer to them from now on. I suggest that you purchase TaxCut instead of Turbo Tax.	negative

title: MY FAVORITE CD OF ALL TIME [SEP] content: I stole this CD from my dad and currently claim it as my own. I grew up with "Truckin'" and "Friend of the Devil" and never knew how much they would impact me. This CD should be issued to everyone at birth.	positive
title: I liked the scent of this product and ... [SEP] content: I liked the scent of this product and it wasn't too sticky either. I prefer this over a solid stick. I would recommend this product to others.	positive
title: What a piece of junk! [SEP] content: A cliche-ridden piece of evangelical hog-wash. The only people who could love this series are a truly frightening cult of christen's who thankfully do not represent the whole. Even if I could buy into the authors' theology, I would rather join the bad guys--locusts and all--than spend time with the stupefyingly dull, self-righteous protagonists. The writing is soooo bad, all I wanted to do is get to through last page so I could throw the book away.	negative
title: A good read [SEP] content: Like other author's book, this one is also easy to follow, a good bedtime read. Unfortunately like other books it lacks more specific detail on the subject although it is present more here then in the other books.The whole series is a good eye opener but author would do all of us a favor if he would make all of it into one book.	positive
title: Good [SEP] content: This is a good album and Abilene is in my opinion one of his best songs. Even still, if I had to compare it to his others I would put this one at the bottom of the pile. If your a fan you'll love it.	positive
title: Works and looks good [SEP] content: We replaced an old fan in our kitchen with this one. This fan works well and looks good, but it's very LOUD!	positive
title: Bluntly gets to the point [SEP] content: Scott Lindquist does not mince words. He gets to the point, talking about a dirty subject in real terms. Not long-winded or swamped with cold statistics or vague descriptions of personal rights violations. Because of his to-the-point manner, Scott's book quickly covers what is important: The campus rapist profile, the escalating steps to the rape and the cover up shame. Good piece of work.	positive
title: Claritin Allergy 24 hour tablets, 10 mg, 45-tablets [SEP] content: The order for these was placed on September 17, 2012 and the expiration date is November 2012. I'm really sorry I bought these.	negative

title: Expensive hassle, no jet spray. [SEP] content: This is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. It simply does provide what you want in a garden hose nozzle.It is very well made, has a comfortable grip and a swivel base.It just does not have any useful spray patterns. No matter where you set the rear flow adjustment or where you turn the front nozzle it only puts out a chaotic mess. No jet stream was attainable.It required way too many turns of the front nozzle to change anything.Not recommended.	negative
title: I LOVED IT [SEP] content: I LOVED IT! THE book was amazing AND AWESOME. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT BOOK. YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY	positive
title: Euforia is nothing compared to " Limite" [SEP] content: I purchased this CD thinking it would be the same or similar to " Limite " but the truth is that it doesn't sound the same, as much as they try they can't be even near as good as they were with Alicia. The distinguished voice of Alicia Villarreal is what made them " Limite ", in the other hand you should buy Alicia's new CD 'cause it's really good.	negative
title: I missed something somewhere... [SEP] content: Everyone gave this really high reviews? Why? I wasn't impressed. And still can't get over his ego. So what, he can sing and dance. So can half of B2K and where did the other ones go? This kid has ego issues...evident in his music and interviews...and I will say this....if he can get over then MAYBE he'll get somewhere in the industry. But the CD was more irritating than impressive. Then again, I need lyrics on top of talent. Good for teeny boppers, bad for me.	negative
title: Fevre Dream?? [SEP] content: I am an avid George R.R. Martin fan, but I was really disappointed with this graphic novel. First, the story seemed contrived and second the illustrations were awful.Write full novels George!	negative
title: A Filthy Commercial Success... [SEP] content: You Chumps that complain about what is or isn't on a compilation are pathetic. If you really like the Stones then you already have everything good. If you rely on someone else to tell you what's worth having or important, then you're just a sucker that's ripe for the taking. Buy, borrow or steal the original whole albums(remastered) 'cause there's ALWAYS great stuff on 'em that doesn't make the "greatest" hits or box sets. I give this 4 stars for the songs but leave one off for thinking we fans even need this contrived concoction. Seriously, it's like talking to children...	positive
title: This is funny...?! [SEP] content: With a market crash just behind us,this couldn't have come out at a worse time.Several major religions have programs of foodstorage for emergencies.Making fun of human fears isn't a real good thing;having lived through the bomb shelter era of the 50'sI have to say that atomic war isn't something that is easy forpeople to be comfortable with.There are cities all over America with 1950'sbomb shelters.I'm sure this fellow thought this was comedy, but it is justpoor taste? The Bush administrationlike the Eisenhower one before has feed on our fears,but they are real fears that we have to deal with.	negative

title: Bad design [SEP] content: The Krups XP4030 is a major disappointment. While it does make excellent espresso it is not capable of adequately frothing milk. I have been making cappuccino every morning since 1993 and have previously owned several steam powered machines and a pump machine that have all been satisfactory and were capable of excellent frothed milk, this machine isn't up to the task. I returned the first one the day after purchasing it and picked up an identical replacement that was only slightly better. After working with the machine daily for 3 months, it still hasn't produced a single adequate cup of cappuccino.	negative

title: Great Movie [SEP] content: As a die hard fisherman I have always enjoyed this movie. I have never been able to find it on DVD until I logged into Amazon. I did however make the mistake of not reading that this was the PAL version so it is incompatible with all of my DVD/multimedia devices. I eventually modded my computer just to watch this movie.Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Joe Pesci movies or just likes fishing in general.	positive
title: Student [SEP] content: It's a really good book and I found it to be interesting.It's a very dramatic book and gave me alot of details to better help me understand what it must of been like to be of that time in history.	positive
title: Twirl-a-tie is better than sliced bread. [SEP] content: It works as advertised. I bought three and they saved me a lot of space in my closet.	positive
title: poorly made... flimsy [SEP] content: This is a terrible product. Its poorly made and very flimsy. The base is worthless. Stay away from this product. Its a waste of money.	negative
title: Excellent documentary about the Battleship Yamato [SEP] content: I bought this along with the Japanese movie "Yamato", aka "Men of the Yamato". Nova uses a few scenes from the Japanese movie, but tells the story of the ship's service, sinking and discovery much better.	positive
title: Not the MUSA version [SEP] content: I bought this for my Kindle due to the excellent reviews for the Musa version without looking at the sample first. Once I opened it up, it was clear that this is NOT the Musa version but a straight translation by Longfellow, which is far, far from what I was looking for. I'm calling customer service about this. The $2 for the Kindle version isn't the point, but it isn't even CLOSE to what the reviews match too. And when typing in Musa's name for a search, this is the only link that comes up. Very disappointing from such a stellar organization like Amazon.	negative
title: A disjointed tale containing two fine set pieces [SEP] content: East of the Mountains was a very disappointing follow up to Snow Falling on Cedars. Snow was a suspenseful murder story, combining a compelling criminal trial, a disturbing return to the internment of Japanes during WWII, a fine description of landscapes and a touching love story.East of the Mountains is a disjointed tale with little of interest. A man ill with an incurable cancer has a car accident and then is sucked into a succession of improbable events that is broken up only by two longish and compelling set pieces.The first is a reminiscence of youth in this region of orchards as the protagonist met and fell in love with his eventual wife.The second is a brutal depiction of a battle during the Italian Campaign in WWII.At the end of the book, the protagonist returns where he started, symbolizing neatly a book that achieves very little, as even the central story of how to deal with death gets nowhere.All in all disappointing.	negative
title: Crap [SEP] content: I saw this in theater and it bored me to death. Annoying performances, ridiculous script and dialogue, and bland visuals. Everyone talks about the bizarre visuals and creepy styel. HA! Just because there are some off the wall colors and sets, it doesn't make a movie "wierd", "scary", or, most of all, GOOD! What a joke. And all the reviewers calling this "gruesome". Huh? A movie that combines gruesome S&M visuals, good plot points, dialogue, acting, and story is Hellraiser or Hellraiser II. This is like Hollywoods glossing over of those flicks. The plot seems a bit similar to Hellraiser II (i.e. heroine gets lost in killers world, must find way out of bizarre landscape of macabre images). Pointless.	negative
title: A review 20 years in the making [SEP] content: I tried to read this book while in grade school. But the book's vocabulary and concepts were too difficult to understand (even with a dictionary). Maybe I was dumb, who knows? Now twenty years later, I just finished reading this book from cover-to-cover. It's an interesting book, but the ending is SUPER-abrupt. I expected a show-down between the forces of good and evil. But the story literally came to a screeching halt with the usual "love conquers all." Well, I'm not saying that love is a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I just expected a much better ending.	negative
title: If a spy movie could be light and fun, then this is it! [SEP] content: Walter Matthau plays a Miles Kendig, a CIA agent pushed out of the field into a desk job by a CIA youth movement. The story follows Kendig as he exacts revenge upon those in the agency who are responsible for is "emasculation".Matthau's performance is vintage Matthau and he is supported by an excellent cast (Julie Christie, Ned Beatty, Sam Waterston and Herbert Lom). Special effects and stunts are minimal, good dialogue and story are plentiful.This movie is a fun and entertaining romp through Europe as the cagey Kendig stays one step ahead of his pursuers.	positive
title: Horribly Depressing [SEP] content: I am a fan of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Every storyline was extremely depressing and most of the characters seemed to have a lot of hatred, especially the children. I don't mind reading a depressing book if it seems to serve a purpose, but if there is a purpose to this particular book, I didn't see it. The only reason I continued reading till the end was because I love the author and I thought this book would have to turn around at some point, but it just ended, without any of the characters having any type of closer. I am extremely disappointed to say the least.	negative
title: Camera ok..............share station......very very poor [SEP] content: The sharestation is probably the worst piece of equipment I have ever purchased. Worked when it wanted to the first couple of months, now it doesn't work at all. I have always liked JVC products but after this dreadful experience, I am gonna have to think long and hard before I buy ANYTHING from JVC. This item will not recognize ANY disc, even the ones I made with it	negative
title: Skip it [SEP] content: Off humor, not really that funny. The movie is very slow in spots. I would skip this one as it is not worth your time.	negative
title: Quality of this book causes much confusion. [SEP] content: On the surface this book looks very informative. It does give a broad understanding of J2EE.BUT, I found the numerous errors and typos to be very distracting to the point that I had to write this review. I would bet there are typos on almost every page of text. Some are so bad that I could not understand the entire topic. Others were less obvious until I read other sources that contradicted this book. In other words, I thought I knew the topic until someone else corrected me. Very bad!Despite the reviews that maybe correctly portray the overall book, I highly recommend boycotting this publisher for putting out such a poor quality book. I for one will try my best to never buy a Prentice Hall book again.	negative
title: good two for one [SEP] content: Both movies are alone worth the price, but as a two on one disc, it was unbeatable. Bought separately it would cost twice what I paid for. Running Scared is more gritty then A Man Apart, which Vin Diesel stars in and did a great acting job for an early effort. He had hair in this one, while Paul Walker stars in Running Scared as a 12 year undercover FBI agent trying to hit the Boston Mobs. But are riveting dramas and a good back to back offering for the evening. I'd recommend it.	positive
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: I ordered this DVD and discovered that it would not play in my region! Be careful when you order from 3rd party sellers!	negative
title: Horrible...Just Horrible [SEP] content: This movie could be one of the worst I've ever seen. The acting is formulaic, the action and story are too. The only difference between this movie and other "action" movies is this one takes place with pirates and on ships. Some of the scenes are beyond laughable (for instance, Geena Davis, in one scene, outruns a team of horses while jumping through windows, dodging obstacles and leaping out another window). If you are aged 10-13, you might like it, otherwise consider yourselves warned. Oh, and the "bad-guy death" scene is the funniest thing I ever saw, but wasn't supposed to be.	negative
title: Stinks [SEP] content: This thing had such a strong odor, tried cleaning it with different soaps, did no good. Just threw it away. Buyer beware!	negative
title: One of the best bun workouts ever! [SEP] content: I have practically every exercise DVD ever made; I have to say this is the one I grab; especially if time is limited (if you are in a hurry, skip one set) This purchase was well worth the money and more! The reviews I read prior to purchase made me reluctant to purchase, but I took a chance and am glad. Who CARES if the models are smiling or not?? They have incredible bodies and that in and of itself is motivating! If your butt improves instantly (which it will), does it matter who is smiling?! Each section is three exercises, and each is done in three sets with a stretch after each. If you have limited time skip a set, but don't skip an exercise. You won't be smiling when you're done working out, but once you look in the mirror you WILL be! Easy to follow workout. Could have been laid out better (exercises lying down, jumping up, then down again), but it's a minor annoyance.	positive
title: MORE OF THE SAME [SEP] content: THE POLICE ACADEMY GETS MORE CADETS AND THEY ALL WORK ON BRINGING DOWN CRIMINALS. THIS WAS THE LAST SEQUEL THAT STEVE GUTTENBERG WOULD RETURN FOR. VERY BORING AT TIMES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, STILL MUCH BETTER THAN THE SEQUELS THAT WOULD FOLLOW. THE HIGHLIGHT HERE IS A YOUNG DAVID SPADE.	negative
title: My daugher likes it ... [SEP] content: We purchased this walker a few months before my daughter was born thinking that it was a good price so why pass it up. Well, when it finally came time to open up the box, the music didn't work. In the instructions it says that there is no way to replace the batteries ... well, if you happen to be married to a very determined "handy man", it can be done. It's some type of watch battery that costs about $15. When the music does play it is extremely loud so we don't even use it after going through all of that trouble. We don't want to hurt our little one's ears. She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though. She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet. I also purchased a stand alone jumper and feel that it was a little more appropriate and money better spent. Just my opinion though. :)	negative
title: Works great, but could be thicker [SEP] content: It looks very fragile, as if it would tear if a stray fingernail scratched it or you tried to fit a little too much. No problems so far with moderate handling, but I wouldn't recommend getting rough with it. All it takes is a pin hole leak to render it useless.Air is vacuumed out easily just by firmly pushing on it. Like the other reviews, I have found slowly sitting on it to be a better method than rolling the air out. The included Sure Zip lock helps to seal the bag easily, but it can be detached and get lost so take good care of it! There's only one seal but I would have preferred two for redundancy.My biggest gripe is it's lack of vertical height. Though the dimensions are just nice, you can't really fit a lot into each bag before the seams look practically bursting. And like I mentioned, I dare not test its limits.In conclusion, great value if it's on offer but don't expect it to last a lifetime!	positive
title: Sincerely embarrassing [SEP] content: Watching this movie, your body feels more stressed and hemmed in by the constant assault of sacharine liberal platitudes than the impending arrival of genocidal militias, which you almost forget about. By the film's excrutiating end, I was half expecting the helicopters to disembark a team of chiropractors. It's hard bashing something that is so sincere, you feel like a bully. However, might I suggest putting on the cans and listening to Peter Gabriel's Biko over and over for two hours while looking at postcards of Bruce Willis and Africa? The pain will remain the same but will work out cheaper.	negative
title: What a great toy! [SEP] content: This is a super cool toy set. My two-year old son and four-year old daughter love it!! Everything is the perfect size and made very well. The iron sounds real. The clips and hangers are a fun addition. My children love ironing their clothes or a doll's outfit and hanging them on the clothes rack. There is a sprayer to which you can add water. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be able to spray (it seems like it is), but I've not been able to get it to spray as of yet. This is a great tool to help your children (esp. boys) with the simple tasks of life. I would buy this again!	positive
title: Equally rich reading [SEP] content: One of the book blurbs from our Press states this to be `the best travel book' of the year. No, no, and no - it is far more than a `travel book', it is instead several rich reading hours of travel, history, anthropology and environmental concerns and delights.We do read of traveling in Orkney (Scotland) where the author was accompanied by her mother, a lady of botanical study, and of the Glades (with some funny education in house-boat handling) and wandering through Greece - a flow of history - and a charming portrait of Belize, an extremely underrated destination for the historical curious.Constantly throughout the book and, obviously the through the author's travel, ecological concerns, tinged with modern guilt arise, but never to the level where our admiration and interest are obstructed and always thought provoking.A delightful read and I will watch the author's web-site to see if any more "travel books" arise in the future.	positive
title: you call this music? [SEP] content: This was the worst CD I've ever laid hands on.My friend gave it to me for my birthday,and when I listened to it I gave it back to her in exchange for something else.What annoys me is that the music would be ok if *Nsync didn't sing it.Their annoying,nasal voices really get on my nerves.Don't waste your money on this!	negative
title: Love this pan! [SEP] content: I have the 11 1/2" size and it's great, you can fit 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in it or 4 or 5 salmon cakes - to give you an idea of the size. It heats up and cooks evenly and browns up your food perfectly. I bought this to replace a Calphalon non-stick skillet that everything stuck to and was a nightmare to clean. This Cuisinart skillet is a nice weight, not too heavy like All-Clad, and not too light. It is SO easy to clean. The most you have to do is soak it a few minutes, then wipe it out.Advise to other stainless steel newbies, it heats up much faster than non-stick or hard anodized cookware, so watch your heat - high is around 6 as opposed to 10. And you want to use some sort of oil, butter or spray to cook with, and put it a cool pan, not when it's heated up or it will burn onto the pan.I look forward to cooking when I use this skillet and I plan to buy more from this line.	positive
title: Kathy Smith - Super Slimdown Circuit [SEP] content: I borrowed this workout from the local library before I decided to buy it. What I like about it is you get effective sculpting of the upper and lower body. The upper and lower body sculpting segments are each about 40 minutes long. It's different from a workout that concentrates on weight training. Each move is displayed by one of Kathy's exercise group members to ensure you do the moves properly before you begin the exercise.There is a cardio segment where you can follow at a slower pace or the ramped-up pace by emulating the exercise group member you choose. When it becomes a little more intense, a 2-minute timer appears on the screen so you know you will be working at that capacity for a short time. This is also about 40 minutes long.This is like getting 3 separate workouts in one DVD!	positive
title: A fresh perspective on making music [SEP] content: I would recommend this book to anyone who plays music because it offers a fresh perspective on performance. I have played the violin for over 20 years and until I read this book I still got nervous before every performance. The most valuable lesson in this book was how to take the focus off of myself and how I was playing and instead focus on bringing the music to life as a service to the composer and my audience. It may seem simple, but the author presents the information in a beautiful and convincing manner. I'm now buying a copy for my sister who is also a violinist.	positive
title: I think y'all owe Courtney a little "Thank You" [SEP] content: There'll be some strange and crazy happenings on this Nirvana box. Songs like "Mrs. Butterworth," "Token Eastern Song," "Talk To Me," "Raunchola," "Immigrant Song," "Opinion," "Do, Re Mi," "Old Age," and a LIVE version of "Big Long Now" just to name a few. Aw hell, just go here for the complete track listing(http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2004/nov04/20041102_nirvana.html). As much as you hate to hear it, this box couldn't have been made possible without the cooperation of Mrs. Love Cobain, so give the woman some respect, folks.	positive
title: Robert Benchley Was One of the Great Humorists [SEP] content: Although some of his work is dated, the writings of Robert Benchley are classic humor and should be included in the curriculum of every English class or creative writing class. He should not be forgotten. I bought this book on Kindle, and have been enjoying it very much.	positive
title: Logan's Run [SEP] content: Logan's Run Is one of my all time favorites, fun 70's camp. The quality of the blu-ray is fantastic even though I wish there would have been more extras on the disk.	positive
title: Idiotic [SEP] content: My extremely low opinion of John Waters work, and particularly the later, higher budget stuff, has absolutely nothing to do with his subject matter. It has everything to do with his inability to write a script and to direct a movie with any coherence whatsover. The only funny moments in this film, or any of his other films, is when an actor of Tracy Ulman's abilities brings something inspired to his tired collections of idiotic potty jokes and strained attempts at outrageous sexual humor. These moments make up about 1 percent of his films, if that. Awful. I guess he keeps getting money to make this garbage becasue people keep buying it, and all power to him for that.	negative
title: Kinking hose [SEP] content: This hose promised to be commercial grade and never have a problem with kinking. It is a nightmare. It kinks constantly, in numerous places. We are disappointed to have paid extra to have a product perform so poorly. If it weren't so difficult to mail back, we would not have kept this item. The only thing heavy-duty about this hose is the weight.	negative
title: The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams Season One. [SEP] content: I chose "The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams for my Niece Juli,she loves the fact that it is rated for all ages,that means that her children can watch it.	positive
title: Incorrect History [SEP] content: Credit is given to some but not all that are actually a part of this history. Where is Nikola Tesla in all of this? Yet again a 'historian' is not acknowledging the true participators in hisotry.	negative
title: undelivered [SEP] content: I never received this product, so I can't really comment on the product. I can comment that I have been ripped off by the folks who were supposed to send it to me.	negative
title: I hate condoms [SEP] content: I generally hate condoms but my partner makes me wear them AND double up so they never break. These don't seem to need to be doubled up IMO. Maybe the cheapo Chinese ones do but these feel strong and elastic enough to hold up! "You can never bee too safe" she believes... Anyway, it's good quantity and priced well too. I just wish they didn't change the prices so often.	positive
title: Use the cards, forget the gameboard. [SEP] content: We play this Charades game as a family with ages from 5 to 55 and we all have fun acting out the clues. But we don't use the game board at all; we have never thought it added to the game. The best part about charades is the acting not the board competition, so we just use the cards and sometimes the dice. Each card has 3 options/clues going from easiest to hardest. We'll stack up the cards; each person takes a turn picking the top card and acting out one of the clues. Sometimes we'll just pick one on the card we want to do or sometimes we'll roll the dice to determine it. The clues are typically animals and actions (e.g. brush your teeth). They are not movies or books like in other charades, so they don't get dated. It's too bad they don't make this game anymore; we found a used copy to give as a gift.	positive
title: Good stuff! [SEP] content: If you own the album, you'll want this video as well. It captures the energy, humor and creative soul that made "Country, Rhythm & Blues" the listen-to-it-over-and-over musical masterpiece it is. It's worth the price just for the Lyle Lovett/Al Green duet alone!	positive
title: Elegant setup and easy-to-use [SEP] content: I bought this item after reading a review online and I must say that I was extremely impressed! It was easy to set-up and use and I had it set to go in about 5 minutes.The router is configured via a web browser and the instructions for use are excellent. That is if you even need to use them, you can usually use the standard setup and it will work just fine.It comes with a built-in firewall protection and allows a multitude of advanced configuration options even DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)It works with both standard cable modem/DSL IP configurations and PPOE setups.	positive
title: How does a sane man like this band? [SEP] content: I loved early 90s grunge rock. I listen to my cds on a regular basis, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, even some of the more obscure bands like Mudhoney i've gotten into. This band just wants to be like Pearl Jam and all of the early 90s grunge bands only they dont have the talent to do it. The band is terribly subpar including Mark Tremonti who is the most overrated guitarist ever. Scott Stapp is the worst singer/songwriter i've ever heard and i have a voodoo doll that i use to put various curses on him so this band will never make another record.Go buy some early 90s grunge, Alice In Chains-s/t says Jared, go get that. Creed ....	negative
title: Useful for MT students [SEP] content: The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because it isn't quite as comprehensive or useful as two other related texts from the same publisher (Diagnostic Bacteriology A Study Guide, and Medical Parasitology A Self-Instructional Text). The format is fairly similar two the other two as well.	positive
title: annoyed [SEP] content: Okay, the seat looks comfortable but I have not yet been able to install it on my bicycle because the clamping system is totally non-standard. Nowhere was there a picture of the underside of this saddle which would have helped me realize that I will also need a new (straight) seatpost to install this saddle on my bike. So, I'm annoyed. Beware: if you have a flanged seatpost you will need to also purchase a straight seat post to go with this saddle.	negative
title: Be Your Own Brand [SEP] content: This is one of the most valuable books I've read. It's very insightful concepts and ideas inspired me to go after some long-held career goals just by using my natural abilities. Thanks to the author, it's working!Newt ShoupLansing, Michigan	positive
title: Awesome for college students [SEP] content: I received this book as a Christmas present and it lives up to its name- PDQ! I am in college and cooking can be difficult with limited time, supplies, and space to cook. The recipes have very few ingredients, are very fast to make, and taste great. Its hard to find a veg cookbook that satisfies all three requirements. Plus there are an assortment of types of recipes like Italian, Mexican, Spanish, Asian, American ect. Plus it tells you what ingredients to substitute to make a recipe vegan and when you shouldn't. Love it!!	positive
title: An absolute snore-fest [SEP] content: Yes, the photography of the movie is beautiful. However, watching the story was horribly slow. It was just boring to see how the relationship between Harrer and the Dalai Lama unfolds so slowly. No emotional strings were strummed. I sat there watching the movies like I spent seven years in Tibet. And when there is action, it is unfairly depicted. The movie makes the Chinese army into a mob of dehumanized villains. I feel that this is the most uncomfortable, high-production movie I have sat through in a very long time. If you want good drama, watch something like The Shawshank Redemption. If you want good cinematography, watch One Hour Photo. If you want a DVD coaster, use your Seven Years in Tibet DVD. Avoid this piece of junk unless you want to fall asleep.	negative
title: Uncomfortable Movie [SEP] content: I need to preface by saying that my taste in movies has changed. I used to love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hostel type flicks, but I don't so much enjoy the torture types that are all too possible. As long as there is a layer of fictionalized separation, I can enjoy. In this case, the movie provides an all too possible eventuality of a normal family being tormented by a pair of social deviants. So the basic story made me uncomfortable. That said, I do believe that the movie is well done; good acting, very well done camera work and sets. High production values. If you're a fan of this type of flick, its for you.	negative
title: This one keeps you guessing to the end. [SEP] content: This is the most recent installment on the life and times of the Iris House Bed and Breakfast and its owner, Tess Darcy. Once more, Tess has fallen head first into a murder, the death of Edwina Riley, an elderly quilter and possibly the most hated woman in town. Discovery of Edwina's secrets and how she collected the secrets of the town adds interest to many of the characters. The characters were well written and drew me in emotionally...I actually grieved over one of their deaths! The true killer never even entered my mind as a possibility until almost the end. Tight and quick action in this story, though I was disappointed that Edwina's house and history weren't more explored. In particular, her old and crumbing mansion and her own past, which is always looming over the story, but never really seen. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable read, hard to put down.	positive
title: A Southern-born political scientist's dream [SEP] content: This book tells the public and private sides of Senator Strom Thurmond. I wasn't sure whether the authors liked or disliked the Senator. That was great! This is a must-read for anyone who wants to appreciate the true Statesman of South Carolina.	positive
title: Good choice for parents too. [SEP] content: My mother got this for me when I was about 3. She put it together and then used it to get me interested in human anatomy.I'm not a doctor now or anything, but I have a very good understand of human anatomy and still find it interesting.So now I pass the buck. I'm buying this to put together for my 3 year old so that he can learn about human anatomy too.	positive
title: Very Usefull [SEP] content: This is a very versitile tool Im glad I got it. Only drawback is that it lacks torque on the low rpm side.	positive
title: The great twist never comes. [SEP] content: I felt like this whole movie was a build up to something that never happened. I kept expecting a great twist or at least some explanation as to why the room is haunted. It never came. Very disappointing.	negative
title: Instructor Review [SEP] content: All in all, not a bad textbook covering the basics on introductory clinical psychology. Loaded with lots of photos and side-bars, the text could have been improved with the use of color vs. B/W shaded images.The text also comes with a CD with added, useful information.Clinical Psychology Concepts, Methods, & Profession	positive
title: huge disappointment [SEP] content: The author's single minded attack on the appeasers make me wonder if the older generations are really that stupid--but experiences tell me that cannot be. I cannot believe that Chamberlain and others would be so stupid as to ignore all these "facts" as piled by Manchester--and Machester never really dug into the mindset of the people with different opinions. The books just goes on and on repeating how terrible these appeasers are without letting us how these people reached their conclusions, and what the public was like back then in general.	negative
title: My Fav When I Was Little! [SEP] content: I had several Richard Scarry books when I was teeny tiny, and I remember loving each one! I am now 29 and about to have my first child and was so excited to come across this book. It will be a great addition to my collection that my mother has saved from when I was a child. I can't wait to share this book with my little one. I hope you and yours enjoy Mr. Scarry's line of children's books as well.	positive
title: Good but could be better [SEP] content: The book does cover a large number of techniques, but none in any detail. If your already a painter this book can be very instructive.	positive
title: Disappointing.... [SEP] content: Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors...I have read all of his work. This was a complete disappointment! If this is your first JONATHAN Kellerman read--Please buy one of his earlier works. The "Santa Fe" story was the worst, the ending just left me hanging and wondering what has happened here..? The "Boston" story was a bit better but not much. I would say, skip this one, Mr. Kellerman has much better work out there.RD	negative
title: A Disappointment [SEP] content: At the beginning I enjoyed this book. The Sparrow is a Jesuit Sci-Fi novel and this combination is interesting. The nosedive begins when the characters easily manage to secure a live-a-board astroid (Jesuit financed) and then travel to a planet light years away. At this point, Russell asks us to believe Fate brought these friends together for this mission. This is a difficult state to reach with her heavy handed writing style. Still, I stuck with The Sparrow hoping its contrived elements were leading up to some profound religious or moral idea. Unfortunately, the ending crumbled away. I found myself reading a 21st Century author's version of the story of Lot. A version long on the misery, and very brief on the implications.	negative
title: 2 time loser [SEP] content: In the beginning I loved my shark. It picked up all the crumbs my kids made and lots of cat and dog fur. I used it at least twice a day. After a month of raving about how wonderful it was, the handle broke off. I tried to get a replacement but the part was unavailable. Figuring I just had a case of bad luck, I bought another one. This time I bought the one with the additional side brush. The side brush was certainly not worth the additional ten dollars as it didn't do any better job than the original one without it. After a month and a half of use the handle broke off (in the same place) on the second shark. Great concept but I cannot afford the monthly replacement costs. I guess it wasn't bad luck but poor quality.	negative
title: Should be a movie [SEP] content: Oh my gosh, this book should be made into a movie. You seldom find a great scary movie anymore, well this book would make a great one! It would be in the money with The Sixth Sense and Signs etc. I wish I had discovered Douglas Clegg earlier. I started with Dean Koontz and have everything he wrote, but am finding it hard to find these older ones of Clegg's. I got it from the library. This book is so exciting all the way to the last page. I found myself reading faster and faster as the excitement grew. Do yourself a favor, try to read this before it is gone.	positive
title: Best Bike Mirrors available [SEP] content: These are the best bike mirrors available by far.The price was a very large discount,Great transaction in all respects.	positive
title: Mine broke down 2 times for less than a year. [SEP] content: The reason I chose Panasonic DVD recorder over other brand is that product is still made in Japan. Most of other DVD recorders now are made in China. I really fell in love with it when I first received it. This is my dream machine I have been yearning a long time ago, so I can retire my vcr. But six months later the machine broke down, I took it to Panasonic to have it service. The machine is still under guaranteed so I don't have to pay anything. Panasonic has good service. And a week ago my machine broke down again. I don't know if I can trust Panasonic DVD recorder anymore.	negative
title: An admirable attempt [SEP] content: While the characters are strongly built and an interesting structural device has been built in, YELLOW JACK never quite gets off the ground. Every once in awhile the characters will do things simply to push the story in the direction the author wants, and the novel itself doesn't really seem to have a point or any sort of conviction. What is quite admirable are the museum catalog descriptions that extrapolate from the speaker's life based on his art, and then the actual descriptions on that life from the speaker himself. But in the end its not quite worth the effort.	negative
title: Very poor book. None of the book content was on exam! [SEP] content: I read this book cover-to-cover. It was so poorly done. It's almost like the author has no understanding of the SCSA exam at all. I took both SCSA exams and neither one had any questions that were related in this book. If you want to pass the exams, I highly recommend that you not read this book! Poor, poor, very poor.	negative
title: didn't live up to expectations, disappointing & meandering [SEP] content: The premise is exciting and unusual, however the promise is never fulfilled. The Visitation for which the book is named is incidental in the book and goes nowhere. Characters come in and out of the protagonists' lives with no rhyme or reason and do not affect any change in the characters (in particular, the Virgin Mary has no immediate or apparent affect on the two main characters's lives). They serve no purpose. Characters who could be interesting are left behind with no further storyline. The story takes many directions only to not develop any and instead go on yet another direction. This could have been a coming of age story, it could have been comic, it could have been compelling, unfortunately, it is none of those things.	negative
title: Satisfied [SEP] content: I had fleas, and the problem was "dying out", because i had sprayed all sorts of other flea products (mostly Raid in the purple can), and was vacuuming like crazy everyday, and throwing out the bag - but I got this product and placed it near the entry door because the fleas were coming onto me by a feral cat outside. Not only did it catch some fleas, but it caught random other bugs like house centipedes, flies and beetles. It's very bright, so don't sleep near it, but I leave it on because now it's a comfort knowing that there's something "at work" while I'm sleeping. It came with two sticky pads, but I bought a spare pack as well.	positive
title: Great entertainment [SEP] content: I love the martial arts scene in the movie but the human interest part of the movie really makes the movie much more fulfilling. While the plot line of Chinese versus Japanese or Western invaders have been used thousands of time, Ip Man, the character, represents the ideals of a teacher and role model better than any other character I can think of and you just can't help by root for him.	positive
title: Revlon RV 544 [SEP] content: Excellent performance. I haven't bothered using the attachments. Some reviewers have complained about the location of the on/off switch. After the first use, that is no longer an issue since one quickly learns how to hold the unit.	positive
title: Money will spent [SEP] content: I moved back to my mom's house after having my baby. I live in the basement with my husband and daughter. We have a separate entrance around back. There is no light in the back yard. I didn't want to spend a lot of money to contract an electrician to hook up the lights so I started looking for another alternative. I came across this item and was pleased by all the positive reviews and purchased the flashlight. All I can say is wow. How can something so tiny radiate so much light. We will be satisfied with this buy.	positive
title: Junk [SEP] content: Since it works only on one circuit it's really great if you need an intercom from one side of a room to the other, except it'll feed back if you try to use it. Otherwise there is no mention that it works only on one circuit so you'll end up spending an hour or two trying to figure out why it works when you test it, but why it won't work when you finally put it where you want it. If you didn't understand like I did that some home smart systems run transmit along wiring you'd never figure it out and it still took me awhile to figure it out.That bullpucky about 1500 feet? Who has a house with a 1500 ft circuit? What one room a fifth of a mile long?I long for a company that is smart enough to do the research themselves. I DON'T want 500 choices where 497 are crap. I want THREE choices. I want the best only cheap, medium, expensive. Retailers should do something to earn their money like do some testing on what you sell.	negative
title: not worth the money [SEP] content: Good sturdy bag, However not worth the price once shipping is included- it is smaller than it looks in the photos.	negative
title: worth reading and re-reading [SEP] content: I read Animal Farm years ago in school, and now again for a book club. It was an enjoyable re-read, and richly rewarding. You notice more and more meaning in it every time. As you read, it serves as both a satire on specific historical events, and a commentary and universal, timeless human nature that shines through in every situation in which there exists a power and information differential.	positive
title: What Junk!! [SEP] content: ...[Let] me tell you, this phone is more trouble than it is worth. Reception is horrible -- so bad that sometimes I had to swith to my cell phone which had much better reception. The answering machine resets everytime the power goes out and resetting it is much more trouble than it should be......	negative
title: This is a very funny book....... [SEP] content: This is a very delightful story....and makes for very funny reading, especially at the Christmas Holidays! I highly recommend this book to everyone!	positive
title: Very old [SEP] content: It is very incredibly old book, all pages have been filled out with pen or pencil. I can not use it because all exercises have been done, I have to buy a new one. It was incredibly cheap but it is very fast, Thanks for everything	negative
title: Good book [SEP] content: This is a good book about Union Cavalry operations with Sherman. Good book if you like civil war history. Worth your money.	positive
title: Best Dylan DVD [SEP] content: Awesome footage and dialogue. I would recommend this to any Dylan fan. The description of how he went from folk to rock is fascinating.	positive
title: I love Bill Bennett, but this is way over the top [SEP] content: Even though we went to the same Jesuit high school, and I would vote for him for President, this is just a little too 'holier than thou'. Come on Bill, Fr. McHale would never be so judgemental, or preachy. We've just entered a 'French phase' politically, and the latest election results show the people are way ahead of the political leadership in your party. This whole affair wouldn't get the time of day in any other country, and I can tell you from my contacts abroad that the U.S. is ridiculed not for Clinton's behavior, but for our media obsession with what my friends overseas correctly see as a personal, family problem, seperate and distinct from the governance of the Free World. Would I invite Mr. Clinton to dinner at my house? No. Would I want him to leave office over this? Also no. It's time to realize that the Puritan Morality is dead and buried. Welcome to the NEW WORLD.	negative
title: Not Just for Urbanites! [SEP] content: Urban Gun Dogs offers practical advice and common sense solutions with a creative twist for anyone interested in training their spaniel. It is a well-written, comprehensive guide that belongs on every spaniel owner's bookshelf... and is one you'll find yourself reaching for time and again.	positive
title: Poor Quality [SEP] content: After unpacking and assembling lamp, I plugged it in and was very pleased with the quality of the spectrum of the light. The lamp worked for TWO MINUTES before it the bulb started flickering. The bulbs never went out completely but they just kept changing intensity. Very poor quality.	negative
title: Broke easily [SEP] content: I gave this to my husband for Christmas and it broke just 2 1/2 months later. He didn't use it as a hammer either, just normal wear and tear. The inner plastic part that holds the blade broke. Worked well while it lasted though.	negative
title: Silverbullet [SEP] content: I've seen alot of werewolf movies and this is by far the scarest for me. I think the special effects were great. It's alot scarier then American Werewolf in Paris or The Howling. I loved the Howling but it doesnt scare me quite like this one. I can barely watch it. That too me makes a great horror movie.	positive
title: Good product, a little expensive [SEP] content: I was very excited when I found this product because I had not seen one before. However, I found the same product at Academy for $15.00 cheaper 2 days after I received the item.	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: Very practical and usefull. One time one radio fell aprox 1m but it resist the impact without a scratch. Very good performance.	positive
title: NOT HER BEST BOOK [SEP] content: I was disappointed in this. I love Poirot, I love Christie, but this was only mediocre. I could get this type of mystery from Dorothy Gilman or someone else who mass produces mystery. Don't get it, please!	negative
title: Boring DVD [SEP] content: I like Pierce Bronson but this movie bored me to death. I could not stay awake while watching it. It was slow getting into the movie and once it did pick up, the same traits as the previous movies were obvious. I think the movie was overrated. There was action but it is the same story as the others. Guy is a spy, sleeps with everyone girl he meets, uses spy gadgets, and in the end continue sleeping with the actress from the movie. Same ole story...	negative
title: Politically Incorrect [SEP] content: This remake of a classic film is an abomination. Supposedly, thethrust of the changes was to remove "racist elements." I have watched the original many times, and I don't see any racist elements, unless you consider the depiction of Africans kicking the ... out of the British Army to be racist. In the remake, a mysterious black bodybuilder guides Harry Faversham step by step through his odyssey. The Ralph Richardson character is reduced to a screaming idiot. Please, watch the original and throw this one in the roundfile.	negative
title: pleased with my purchase [SEP] content: I bought a Suburban that the previous owner had a little too much fun with. The mirror was broken and I needed a replacement. I called the dealership and gave them my vin to get the actual part number. The Left one and Right one are one number off from each other. Make sure you check with the dealer before you buy to get the actual number for the right wire harness... They wanted $450 for the replacement. I went with this one and it works fine. It doesn't have the feel of the factory one, but all of the mechanics work perfect. I recommend buying a pair. They won't match your stock one on the other side if you buy only one. But they look good together. -J	positive
title: Best of Live in New York Series [SEP] content: None of the live in new york cd's come close to the energy and muscianship on this alblum. It contains an amazing in unison Teen town between Jaco and guitarist. In this cd Jaco covers everthing from Mcartneys Blackbird to Hendrix's Pirpule haze. Great solo's and good sound quality add to the mix.	positive
title: Not worth the money [SEP] content: These signs are cardboard and blow over in just the gentlest breeze. Definitely not worth what I paid. I will be going out to buy something sturdier and these will be tossed in the garbage!	negative
title: Fantastic concert [SEP] content: This was a fantastic concert. I had the chance to see Iron Butterfly on this tour at there concert in Berlin in 1997. This is a good remember of this concert.	positive
title: eats ink [SEP] content: Good for scanning, print quality is average. Previously owned an HP printer, which was bulker, so I bought this printer because it was more stream-lined. They also had a special deal on it when we bought our computer. However, it eats ink much more than the HP. Also the ink for the Cannon is harder to find in stores, and is more costly than other brands. I bought ink for this printer about a month ago, after using the printer for two weeks, the low ink display came on. It kept showing this everytime I would print. Two weeks later since the first display came on, the ink is now completly empty. Typically we print about ten pages a week. The HP printer was more expensive, but the ink was less, and the Cannon was cheaper and the ink is more. Maybe that is the trade off.	negative
title: Super! [SEP] content: Wow, I loved this book. This was my first read from this author and am very pleased. Look forward to the others.	positive
title: Mom Your Fired [SEP] content: Well, lets put it this way, I'm 26 now, and I read the book when I was about 9. It hit home at the time, and I think my daughter could use it when shes that age. The book focused on a young girl who was embarassed of her mother. I'm sure you can remember feeling that way at times as well. The girl then comes to understand that her mom has never meant to do any such thing, and realizes that love is all that matters between the two of them.	positive
title: not a very good buy [SEP] content: the product arrived on time, but the quality is poor. The light is too dim. would not recommend buying	negative
title: Too thick! [SEP] content: This product is so thick, I can't even get it out of the bottle! Not sure if it's dried up or what's wrong with it, but not usable.	negative
title: It's an eraser. It erases. [SEP] content: This thing is a little weird looking. It looks like a little cardboard box. But it does the job as well or better that the more usual Expo erasers, plus it is nice to be able to rip off a sheet and have a clean eraser every few weeks.	positive
title: Only good for bagels [SEP] content: If you are planning on using this toaster for waffles or regular toast forget it. The slots are wide enought for bagles but with smaller (regular) size breads they slide down and get stuck. I sent mine back.	negative
title: It's a disappointment [SEP] content: This one, from an accomplished and popular artist, is a disappointment. He seems caught up more in the harmonics of these tunes -- which are sadly similar to one another -- than he does in the rhythm. The result is clever chord changes without a steady tempo. Most disappointing is the audio quality. It's either his left hand on the frets or his right hand doing the plucking and strumming, but there are ugly squeaks that occur much too often, and it quickly becomes distracting. I'm a huge and steady Pizzarelli fan, of both Bucky and John, so this outing is saddening.	negative
title: cool book [SEP] content: not the best read ever(kinda long and drags out at the end), but very unique and powerful story. certainly worth the read and the buy.	positive
title: Suprisingly aggressive and never without agenda. [SEP] content: One needs only to ready the first few pages of this book to learn what lies in store for the reader - a whiny and consistently backbiting deconstruction (or at least an attempt at it) of the US government and international policies.Unfortunately, I didn't stop after just the first few pages, but powered on to the end. It's not that the materials or concept of finding faults with the US foreign policy is bad - it's that this book is. It's delivery is terrible and the agenda of the writer is clear.There are better books for histories of US foreign policy & actions & snapshots of current affairs and how things need to change.	negative
title: Cheap collar [SEP] content: While my dog did not bark for the two hours that she had it on, the collars connection snap did break. I found the collar out in the yard about two hours after I initially put it on her. I would not buy from this company again.	negative
title: A unique but boring book. [SEP] content: The Giver started out pretty good but as I read it it really started to stink. Children of 12 and under should not read it because of lack of understanding. As the end comes it realy gets annoying.	negative
title: Project Mangement [SEP] content: This book is too technical and not really practical. I was not satisfied when applying it to project management. I suggest to find search other books in project management. Not a good resource.	negative
title: almost a year now [SEP] content: I purchased this keyboard last January. I could live without it, but I've found that it makes entering text a lot easier. I have had some of the same problems that others have had with it. I've found that if you wiggle the keyboard while its connected to your visor, and the visor is on, then problems with hotsync are more likely.My biggest issue with this product is that I couldn't ship it outside USA. I had to ship it to a US address and then get it forwarded to Canada. Well I have it now, and you can't have it back.	positive
title: If you love pride & prejudice, this is a must see [SEP] content: This story is clever. Originally, I saw it on Netflix and had to buy it and have my own copy! Ive watched it multiple times and never get tired of it.	positive
title: Fabulous source of information [SEP] content: I found this book to be clear, easy to understand, and full of information on a variety of questions regarding Islam. It's writen very well and is great for people who have never heard of, or learned about Islam. It's even great for people who do have some history with Islam. A joy to read and I highly recommend it.	positive
title: No Chorus [SEP] content: If you don't like hooks and chorus and enjoy pure rap, this album's for you. This is an emcee not BSing w/ commercial ish. Pure lyrics. Due to complex lyrics, this album isn't meant for uneducated individuals. If you're smart and like rap, cop this album! Let the mind stimulation begin.	positive
title: too much swearing :( [SEP] content: every other word was F--K and MF, so I was disappointed with it! I still love Ice Cube though.	negative
title: Not worth what I paid for it [SEP] content: I thought this would be a perfect container for my son's diaper bag. Boy was I wrong! Yes, it has a sliding close lid but it doesn't stay shut. It doesn't click into place or have a latch or anything. So, if the bag was bustled the lid would slide open and dump everything out.	negative
title: An Updated Classic [SEP] content: As a clinical psychologist who uses the Rorschach regularly and teaches it to graduate students, I have always relied upon this volume as a bible of sorts for all-things-Rorschach. The newest edition is a wonderful updating of the classic. Despite being about the same number of pages as the last edition, this volume packs much more information in, and is written in a more concise and relevant way. Exner has updated some of the historical lore regarding Hermann and the roots of his test, as well as incorporating a full chapter on controversies surrounding the Rorschach. Furthermore, the interpretive section is modeled after the format of the very useful Primer on Rorschach Interpretation, and incorporates all of the recent changes and innovations in the Comprehensive System. This volume could easily be the "one stop shop" for Rorschachers, as it has normative data, administration and scoring guidelines, and a well-organized interpretive section. Who could ask for more?	positive
title: No comparison to Feynman [SEP] content: After reading this book and then reading other comments on this book, I felt compelled to put in my two cents worth. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, this book is NOTHING like the Feynman lectures. Those books are so well written they can be read and understood by people with no background in physics. This text is complex and elegant in some places, but not something I would really recommend for a beginner (ie. someone unfamiliar with abstract models of computation). If you want a book that conveys the same material in a much more concise and understandable manner, buy the Sipser text.	negative
title: Mixed Emotions [SEP] content: This series could be so much better than it is - I have to say Caillou is pretty whiney. Also - why does he have no hair? He looks like one of those poor kids w/cancer. Also - lastly, what kind of name is Caillou?? Anyway, my little three-year old loves Caillou but i wish they would make him less WHINEY. I love that everything (including the kitchen sink) is in primary colors.	negative
title: History of Art, Revised, Janson [SEP] content: I purchased this book to prepare for an art certification exam. I used this test back in 1984 while earning an art degree. It traces the history of art from the Ancient World to the Modern Art. It has four sections stating the primary sources which serve as a self review. The illustrations are beautiful, and the text contains plenty of interesting facts and descriptions of the art and their meanings. I found the typeface size slightly small, but it is clear and precise. The book weighs seven lbs. and it has 1,032 pages. It is a hardback and it comes in its own hardcover pocket.	positive
title: Parent Manual on Sex terms: A prep for sex education of children. [SEP] content: This is a must have book for parents of young children. Parents in the monogomus-marriage religious traditions (Jewish, Christian,& Muslim) will value this book as their manual to learn to speak comfortably with each about sex, and, when time indicates it's needed with their children.	positive
title: Broken before first use!!! [SEP] content: I got this lens for Christmas. Got it out of the box to try it out yesterday. I accidentally dropped it, not a big drop just a small drop but onto a tile floor. The lens broke in half and is unrepairable. Warranty does not cover drops. Do not buy this item! It is plastic and cheap. We all have those accidents, and I have dropped my other lens in even worse conditions, and they survived just fine. Spend a little more and get the metal body it will pay for itself in the long run.If you do ignore this warning, prepare yourself for buying a replacement or be extremely careful with it. I may have been extremely unlucky, but I feel that this lens will break for most people, its just a matter of time.	negative

title: Collective Soul "Home" DVD AND CD [SEP] content: I've been a Collective Soul fan for 11 years and they just keep getting better.The DVD AND CD capture the spendor that is Collective Soul.If you've never been to a show,this collection will make you want to go.The ASYO enhances their music with their playing and heart, especially Ed's "Pretty Donna".The Soul fans have been waiting for a "live" DVD from Collective Soul for a long time and now have been given a true testament from Collective Soul.I am glad I found their music 11 years ago and hope they keep playing as they have.The Dvd and Cd is a must have so buy it today!!! Rob Hudson	positive
title: Remedial Rhetoric [SEP] content: I enjoyed the book so much that I signed up to received regular emails illustrating "figures" of speech, as they are used popular media. Jay Heinrichs presents the fundamentals of rhetorics in an unpretentious and transparent manner. A lot of information is presented, and I have come to regret, like Heinrichs, that rhetoric is not taught in schools. I would have benefited from having learned these concepts in grade school. Having been persuaded the power of these techniques, I did get a little bored with the ending, where he makes a case that a rhetorically-trained society would be a more democratic one. While I enjoyed the book tremendously, I didn't give it a "5" because I felt the production of the book was poor. I had to send back my first one because it was defective (missing 30 pages), and the layout of the pages looks like it was done by a high-schooler. Also, I thought the conclusion a bit anticlimactic.	positive
title: I can't belive I have to give this a star! [SEP] content: Limp Bizkit is the worst all he does is talk it isn't even muisc and he obsessed with bad words. And he bad as heck!	negative
title: If you don't share your body, friends will swim away? [SEP] content: This book is great for the water and has beautiful art, but it has a disturbing message. The deeper meaning that I want to keep away from my child's subconscious is that he must give away body parts to make friends. Even if one takes the shiny scales as a metaphor for money or toys, any friend that stays for what he gets is an opportunist in my opinion. I will teach my child to share and to make sacrifices for his friends when they are in need but not with this book. When my child learns to read, I will remove this book from the bookshelf.	negative
title: Well, you get what you pay for [SEP] content: The sound is very poor but this is a nice solution for let's say listening to your iPod while you cook... if it's right there next to you. Also, the sound quality is not so good either.However, this are pretty cheap speakers so you are only receiving what you paid for.	negative
title: A Gothic masterpiece [SEP] content: Bob Dylan once said, "Don't criticize what you can't understand", yet a number of people who are clearly clueless about Jacob's Ladder have done just that.Jacob Singer's Book of the Dead journey of the soul is the thread that holds this dark, surrealistic quagmire together. I believe the biblical Jacob's Ladder was a ladder connecting Earth and Heaven, like the Earth-Sky conduits evident in so many Emily Carr paintings, hence the title choice by Bruce Joel Rubin.The more Jacob rages to hold onto life and to make sense of the kaleidoscope of horror that keeps exploding upon his consciousness, the harder his personal demons bite back. Only at the moment of final surrender can he see that the Enemy is himself, and he is able to release his previously earthbound soul from its prison of fear.As one astute reviewer put it, the ending is the point of the film.	positive
title: Have to stand up to see caller id. [SEP] content: I'm amazed at this design flaw. I don't have space to wall mount this phone, so It must sit on my desk. However, when it sits on the desk, the display is tilted backwards (away from the person sitting at the desk), so I must stand up to read caller id display (to decide if I want to answer the phone). How annoying. The whole reason I got a speakerphone was so that I could work uninterrupted at my desk if I wanted to answer calls. Now I have to stop my work and stand up to decide. If you can wall mount this phone, the display would be easily visible, and the phone might otherwise work great. I never got as far as to try it.	negative
title: WOW........MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS [SEP] content: Santa brought my 2 yr old daughter this Loving Family House & Stable. I was going to try the TownHouse, but it was sold out. Well, I am glad we started with this, she just LOVES it!! She loves the horses, the people, everthing. She got some extras from family members who must have an IN with Santa. She plays for at least 30-45 mins at a time, which for a 2 yr old is HUGE! I think for her birthday she will get a few more Loving Family items. I give this a FIVE STAR!!!	positive
title: Excellent Labels [SEP] content: These have never jammed my printer, are easy to peal off, and are strong enough to adhere to an envelope without worries.	positive
title: I own it, you shouldn't [SEP] content: I purchased this product as a spare. I left it in my garage in the box and when I needed it because my other unit failed, it had been a few weeks over a year since its purchase. I plugged it in and the fan worked the display functioned, everything appeared fine. The unit never produced an ounce of water. I called the warranty people at the company, and they were unresponsive and curt. Said if I mailed the unit at my expense 800 miles to some service center that they might cover the parts depending on which parts had failed. Do youself a favor and look at another brand of dehumidifier.	negative
title: Supertramp??? NOT!!! [SEP] content: I'm a big Supertramp fan and I have been for years. I have just about every album from Crime of the Century onward (well, I drew the line after Free as a Bird). However, for some reason, I did not have this particular album so I went ahead I bought it. Well, now I know why I did not have it. It's because this album has nothing to do with the Supertramp band we know (and love). Honestly? If you want Supertramp-like albums, I recommend Roger Hodgson's solo efforts. If you think you'll have another Supertramp album, you will be disappointed big time. The sound is as far as it can be from the "classic" Supertramp sound. The songs are melodically weak and boring (although they were written by Hodgson). No catchy tunes here. So, unless you are dying to spend some money and don't know where to, I'd not get close to this album.	negative
title: Great book [SEP] content: I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers, and I was so excited when I found this book. I was not let down, It may not be something I read again like I do Kinsella books but few are. I loved it, it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care, I still fully enjoyed this.	positive
title: Awesome! [SEP] content: Nothing like the shine of chrome on a 1970 Buick GSX....it may only be 1:18 but it looks like it's 18:18. :)	positive
title: An excellent mix of entertainment and education [SEP] content: As a die hard fan of "Seinfeld" and a person without previous exposure to philosophical concepts, I found this book entertaining and educational.The book is a collection of essaies by different authors, using characthers and situations of "Seinfeld" for introducing us to Kierkegaard (using Kramer as an example of the aesthetic stage), Socrates (with a funny comparison to the dual role of Jerry as real person a TV show characther), the moral life and, of course, the meaning of "nothing", among other topics.Not all the chapters were equally interesting, but most of them are very enjoyable, as the style and language is never too elevated. The book includes a episode list, a chronology of philosophers (with a quote from each one, so you can rapidly get the idea of their thinking), and a brief, but funny, description of the authors.Highly recommended.	positive
title: This Album is Great!!! [SEP] content: Hey ya'llthis cd is the best of all KoRn Albums...If you have some problems with your life?You wanna scream with all your angry?This cd will help you...	positive
title: More of the same old Satanic Panic stuff [SEP] content: If you've read one, you've read them all. Smith offers nothing new here and worst yet he mixes up Wicca with Satanism. If you enjoyed the first 2 Witchcraft movies then you'll love this! The most memorable part of this book is the dedication, the author dedicates this to Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Straub, and so on. Well, I call that an insult. For if the masters of Horror are inspiring work like this then they must be stopped! For true Satanic horror read Rosemary's Baby and Dark Debts!	negative

title: Love it! [SEP] content: If your child plays with their Pocket very much, you will want this. My son plays with his daily and this charges has saved a ton in batteries. Very nice and easy docking station, and charges quickly. We couldn't live without it!	positive
title: Way too expensive [SEP] content: I bought this product and it is sitting on my dining room table. First of all when you read the booklet it tells you that you should be 5 months pregnant or more. I am 4 months pregnant and I cannot hear a thing and I don't think that I will ever hear anything. My advice is wait for your prenatal appointments. This product is way too expensive and it is a waste of good money.	negative
title: Hats off to EPIC [SEP] content: Recieved this yeasterday and spent 6 straight hours playing it.I have the pC version and have been a UT fan for years but I just enjoy XBOX/360 more and im more comfortable with controler.The graphics in this version are absolutely stunning in 1080P glory and excellnt 5.1 Dolby Digital audio.In multiplay I was given a choice of join a match or hosting.All the maps are here plus 5 exclusive to 360.No modding capabilities but who cares?Some do but I don't.The online multiplay was smooth and lag free.Buy this with no regrets.9 out of 10.	positive

title: Lance Lopez Sucks [SEP] content: I have to agree with the Austrailian reviewer that Lance Lopez offers nothing on this or any other disc. His regurgitated style is nothing more than a duplicate copy of overused Hendrix licks. There's nothing new offered here and the disc and lopez himself, are a disappointment. I am usure why anyone would buy this, or any other Lance Lopez record.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.	negative
title: "UP" lets me down [SEP] content: I love & have loved Peter Gabriel for many years. He is a brilliant, intuitive, insighful artist. I saw him perform live last December 2002 from first row seats. He is a fabulous live performer. I was and still am terribly disappointed by "Up." It is muddy and overproduced. I remember unwrapping the CD in my car immediately after purchasing it in the store, feeling like a child on Christmas morning, only to open my packages to find dirt & mud & rocks. I don't recommend it. Buy all of his other albums.	negative
title: Finally, a poacher that works in the microwave! [SEP] content: Never thought this would be avaliable. I have tried for years to poach eggs using glass cups and never have perfected it.I bought two. One for the office and one for home. Works great, you may have to adjust power/time a little but the eggs turn out close to the old fashioned way. Yummy!	positive
title: Helpful for teen self-esteem [SEP] content: I got this book to better understand my daughter who was 14 at the time. She took the book away from me to read it. I kept hearing "this is ME!" and "look, mom, this is why I am this way." She felt reassured that she was normal and is embracing her strengths. She has been happier with herself and is interacting with other teens and adults much better; she has "come out of her shell". I highly recommend this book to introverted preteen/teens and their parents. It really describes the introverted traits well and the questionnaire is helpful. MJM	positive
title: Chutzpah in its most ditasteful sense [SEP] content: I was surprised to have received this propaganda leaflet disguised as a book in the mail. it turned out a few Jewish friends of mine have received it as well. It arrived with an impersonal spam-like letter that spoke about some divine inspiration the author experienced in a dream..Sid Roth, keep your dreams to yourself, they belong with you in your bed. How dare the publishers send out a cheep proselytizing brochure to people's homes and mask it as an inspired work of literature.This should be illegal	negative
title: The True Story of the Bataan Death March [SEP] content: This is an excellent documentary on the American and Philippine defenders who resisted the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World war II. Tragically ... shamefully, for months they fought heroically without reinforcements or supplies due to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Europe First" policy. He even ordered General Douglas MacArthur to escape to Australia while Major General Edward P. King "surrendered" the 75,000 Americans to the Japanese. It's after this surrender that the heart wrenching "Death March" took place. The sacrifice and suffering these men endured is told in bold detail through film footage and first-person accounts from fifteen survivors. This DVD is a "must have" for any WWII history buff. I rated it 4 stars only because it should have been an hour long instead of 30 minutes. Today it seems everyone in the armed services is called a "hero." This film introduces you to real Heroes in every sense of the word.	positive
title: Removed pomegranate stain! [SEP] content: I was cutting up a pomegranate and accidentally sprayed my white shirt with it. (Never cut a pomegranate in a light-colored shirt!). I tried to use the stain remover that has removed wine stains before without a problem. It only made the pomegranate stain worse! I then remembered about a tube of Didi Seven that had been sitting in my laundry room but I had forgotten all about it. When I applied Didi Seven, the stain disappeared entirely within seconds!	positive
title: Blades are horrible [SEP] content: The blades continue to separate and fall off. Very very disappointed.As soon as the blades come in contact with whatever should be cutthe blades come apart.	negative
title: Don't really know tennis balls [SEP] content: I am not qualified to professionally rate tennis balls, but here is my two cents. I bought these as a dog toy to that end they do good and were a good price. I am not sure what punishment; a puppy GSD or a tennis racket would be worse	positive
title: bad seller [SEP] content: I am not able to review this item since I never received it. There was a mistake in the address and it never reached me. When I discovered this mistake, I tried to contact the seller but was unable to find even an email. There is no means of communication with seller that I was able to find. I even went as far as contacting the postal service and they put a request in with the shipper to contact me, but there was no attempt at communication whatsoever!!! I will be very uneasy to ever buy from Amazon in the future and if I do I will look for contact information to the seller first and only then place an order.	negative
title: "Hold your chins up high..." [SEP] content: This movie is THE funniest movie of all time. Period. Airplane, The Naked Gun, they're close, but they are by the same duo of Zucker-Abrahms, so we are in that league with Brian Donors. The title had to be the only thing holding this movie back from the mass market. With quotes like "Hey cabbie, isn't that meter going by awfully fast?" "YOU must be a speed reader,""..well you got me there" and "Lilian, Rocko, Rocko, Lilian....in order to tell you two apart, one of you is going to have to start wearing a mustache." It can't be beat for 1 liners. BUY IT NOW!!!	positive
title: Junk! [SEP] content: Space bar was stuck within the first 5 minutes of use. Never did unstick so I sent it back. Great return process, just a poor keyboard.	negative
title: Keenan is national treasure [SEP] content: Actually, I am far from the type to peruse gay, broadway-based novels. Quite the contrary. But by the time I figured out what "Blue Heaven" was all about, I was laughing too hard to quit.I can't remember just bursting into laughter so often reading a novel. Keenan ranks up there with Christopher Moore and Tom Sharpe as one of the handful of funniest writers alive.It was only after reading his books (and fretting for him to do more) that I realized he was also the writing genius behind the "Frasier" TV show, certainly one of the better-written shows ever.I won't try to impress you by layering on verbiage here: just get this and read it. Make sure you don't have any liquids in your mouth at the same time.	positive
title: simple entertainment [SEP] content: Ah, the old viewmaster that I use to play with back in the 60's. I purchased a new viewer and wanted to find interesting 3D reel cards to entertain my children. The viewmaster is old school entertainment and only captivates the new generation of children as a trivial antique toy that Dad shares with us...Nice 3D pictures of Kennedy Space Center during the height of Nasa's space adventures.	positive
title: Great Coffee Maker [SEP] content: This model is a step down from the Cuisinart coffee maker that was top rater by Consumer Reports. It brews great coffee. The timer function works flawlessly beeping when the coffee is ready. There is also a beep when it turns itself off. Clean up is a breeze as the pot, it's lid, and the filter basket can all go in the dishwasher.	positive
title: Great gift [SEP] content: This was a Great gift for my 8 yr old niece. It is great for her to learn more about her own feelings and to be able to express that and hopefully look back on how she felt at that time in her life. All the things she likes and creating memories she will remember.	positive
title: Pooped out after changing color cartridge [SEP] content: I had the same problem as another user of this printer only it was when changing the color cartridge. I worked with an HP technician and they could not help me. Basically the printer melted down after I attempted to change the tri-color cartridge. It would no longer recognize the cartridge even after cleaning the cartridge and the printer contacts. It will not print correctly with the black cartridge either now. I've had it for maybe 1 1/2 years. HP printers used to run a lot longer. I'm moving on to another brand.	negative
title: Starts out good but ends in too much ego [SEP] content: This volume is nowhere near as good as Morris' other works. It starts out interesting enough but ends with nothing but letters of praise for how wonderful Dr. Morris' students think he is. Morris can do much better than this.	negative
title: Skynard [SEP] content: The music is fine. The same can't be said for the CD. It played fine at first but within 2 weeks it started to lose cuts and be less and less reliable. The same player plays other CD's with no problems. This one is heading for the recycling bin.Don't waste your money.	negative
title: 526 [SEP] content: This was a great book and I couldn't put it down. It really reassured me in my faith in God and helped me ease with losing my dad.	positive
title: Not worth the money [SEP] content: After reading the vague and extremely basic instructions, we tried to make our first batch. about half way through, the rollers jammed. Tried contacting the manufacturer only to be told the warranty doesn't cover this problem because they deemed it misuse. So I disassembled it and freed the rollers (due to poor machine work). Then the thickness adjustment knob failed. The thin metal used to make it actually tore. Don't bother with this one. Maybe others aren't so bad.	negative
title: OpticSale is the worst vendor on Amazon [SEP] content: Do NOT buy anything from this vendor. They do not stand behind their products. I ordered a set of Uncle Mike's swivel loops that rusted in less than 3 months. The gun was never exposed t water/rain. I contacted the vendor but they refused to send me a replacemnt pair of swivels. I quess $10 would bankrupt them. Never again will I buy from these clowns.Uncle Mike's Quick Detachable Super Swivel with Tri-Lock (Blued, 1-1/4-Inch Loops)	negative
title: POP it is [SEP] content: I am a school librarian and my class and I are writing this review. Everyone thinks it is a great classic. We have done pictures in the various styles displayed in the book and have had the greatest time. We will be visiting the museum nearest to us which has modern art just to see where Ms. Isadora's inspiration came from. We want to thank her for letting us see the world in a different way.	positive
title: One half of the golden couple missing [SEP] content: I would not buy this even though it has Rolando Villazón, but only because I already have the one which also has Anna Netrebko!	positive
title: Wow A Very Sad Almost... [SEP] content: Wow, I listened to the NPR interview with Maya Rudolph and Terry Grose and was captivated by the movie's content. I have two breatuful daughters and a lovely wife. We have had our beautiful daughters and many tough time that the movie failed to relate to on so many levels. The ending dailog was the worst. If I had been asked to write the lines I could have saved it but the lines were put to film. Is there something less than one star. The one was only for trying. What I would actually rate this movie was that you invaded being a human with children. Nothing redeeming for those who have childred and love them.	negative
title: Werewolf the Forsaken = WTF = What The F@%k [SEP] content: Seriously WTF says it all. White Wolf will definetly go under in about 2 years if they don't ever re-release the old system. Here is a message for White Wolf, taking out the point of Werewolf (the apocolypse, the wyrm) and leaving them just standing around with there claws up there butts then I might as well play a werewolf in d20 modern. Honestly, give me WtA or give me White Wolf's death.	negative
title: Excellent [SEP] content: I love this book. I'm so sad that I will never be able to read this book for the first time again! I would say that there are a few technical errors in this book, but it's beauty and originality far over shadow any of that. If you are thinking of reading this, please do!	positive
title: not worth the effort [SEP] content: The boot tops look great in the pictures, and the idea is a good one, but they simply never stop falling down. The effect is ruined when your flimsy "boots" are always dragging down to your ankles.	negative
title: Anguishing Post-Holocaust Novel [SEP] content: This novel is the story of a Holocaust survivor and his attempt to juggle three women in mid-20th century New York City. Although there are some amusing moments, this is not a book to be taken lightly. The devastation these people have suffered because of the Nazis has all but left empty shells. Singer's style in this novel is quick-paced and straightforward with remarkable dialogue.	positive
title: HORRIBLE CD! [SEP] content: I just got the cd,and listened 2 it.IT WAS HORRIBLE.All they are,are white rappers, (a.k.a POSERS)Rich thinks he's blck,but da lyrics is WACK!!I thought the cd would be tight,but I WAS WRONG!DEVON CANNOT SING!Whoeva gave da boy 10 solos needs 2 be dragged into the street,shot and killed,and SO DOES DEVON!(DON'T BUT THIS CD)!!!THE lyrics have NO meanin,and "girl on tv",was nothin but a rip of TQ'S "WESTSIDE",and their song"westside",was also a rip of tq's"westside",and what do they know about WESTSIDE ANYWAYZ (TV?)	negative
title: Novice to Expert in One Book! [SEP] content: Rarely does one run across a book that allows one start out knowing absolutely nothing about a specific product but in the end leaves you feeling quite comfortable and even competent at supporting others on that product. Small Business Server 2000 Best Practices by Harry Brelsford is just such a book. And instead of the typical dry technical diatribe, Harry's personality and humorous quips are sprinkled throughout - keeping the reader awake and very interested.	positive
title: can't be ezier to use it [SEP] content: I don't have too much carpet to vacumn, so this is perfect for me. I tried several other kinds but I don't like the heavy weight monster vacumn at all. There is only one master bedroom upstairs, and living room down stair come with Carpet, so ez to carry it every where. I am suprised how it work, it could clean my kitchen, stairs, and even wood floor very well. The only thing I worried about is the battery life, it takes hours to recharge, but last for about an hours or so. Good enought for me though.	positive
title: disappointed [SEP] content: I had a Clairol 3 panel mirror for 15 year and loved it. The lighting on the Conair mirror is not bright enough at ANY setting	negative
title: great new sound [SEP] content: Listeners who like Ruben Blades will like this group, and since Celtic, Salsa and African music all come from the same place in the heart, this is a nice addition.	positive
title: Good, Versatile Microphone [SEP] content: I've been using this microphone for years. I have two of them, actually. I didn't buy them as a matched pair, so one is a bit brighter sounding than the other. That can be an advantage, as I use the darker mic for overly bright sound sources, and vice-versa. I've used these mics with good results in my project studio, on vocals, guitars, and hand percussion, and actually earned a major film festival award for music I created in that studio. I think the mics sound particularly good on female voices (as a number of reviewers have noted). The figure-of-eight pattern offers the flattest response curve, and I almost always use that for vocals. (The cardioid and omni pattern give more treble/upper mids boost--useful for some applications, but a little harsh on my voice.)Bottom line: This is a well-made, versatile microphone that will do pretty much anything you ask of it.	positive
title: A Used Ipod 80GB [SEP] content: For a used Ipod, this one was in fairly good looking condition. However, it wouldn't sync to any library in excess of 150 songs. I took the unit down to my local Apple store, waited in line for about 1 hour and was told that the hard drive was defective. They reformatted for me, but it still wouldn't work. At my expense, I sent the unit back to Coral Reef Electronics. I don't believe this unit was adequately tested by them (there was 1 song on the drive, which is not much of a test), otherwise they would have caught the problem.Although Coral Reef took the unit back (and refunded the purchase amount) without giving me a hard time, I would be very careful what you buy 'used' from them.	negative
title: fairly average film [SEP] content: say this film the other night&while the cast was interesting&certain things worked overall the story itself never quite jived with all the Folks involved within the film.things seemed a bit off.Dan Aykroyd was pretty good here as was Walter Matthau but the film just didn't move me enough.	negative

title: Still Trying To Figure Out Where All The Hype Came From [SEP] content: I finally broke down and purchased this book after several episodes of picking it up off of the shelf, scanning the back cover and buying something else. I should have followed my first, second and third instincts and left it in the store. I read it in the space of an afternoon and it didn't live up to even 10% of all the hype it has generated. I don't know which book all of these people who gave it 4-5 stars read but the one I read had boring and materialistic characters, a predictable storyline and an abrupt, boring ending. I hope her new one is better but I can't even waste my time reading it to find out.	negative
title: waterproof and reliable [SEP] content: 100% waterproof as I have taken my dog swimming many many times with it on. It is 100% submersible. I love the 16 settings and the warning sound. I've has it for almost 1.5 years and the battery is needing frequent recharges but I definitely would buy again.	positive
title: Wayfarer Redemption (VOL. 1 - 3) [SEP] content: This series has impressed me so much. Sarah has joined the list I feel are some of the best fantasy writers. If anyone is a committed reader of D&D;, dragonlance, Terry Brooks, Robert (R.I.P) Wheel of Time Series!,Forgoten Relms, ect.I will always support sarah in the future.	positive
title: Compelling and exceptional [SEP] content: I am not Jewish nor was this book required reading. In fact, theboys in this book.... But I found this book deeply moving andsatifying. I am not going to change my Faith because I read it, andit seems to me that it is encouraging that belief is held as deeply asis illustrated by the characters in this very fine work. I am goingto read the sequel because I want to know what comes next in the livesof these intelligent, admirable characters. This is one of the bestbooks of fiction I have read in a long time.	positive
title: Where is the software [SEP] content: Just got the package. There was no CD in it. The web address given in the book to download the software is not correct. Not good.	negative
title: Overrated [SEP] content: It is a quick read so if one is interested they should pursue it, but with hesitation. It is not as good as the hype.	negative
title: NON-STICK COATING PEELS OFF [SEP] content: I had high hopes for this product but it was not quality teflon and so the silver border around it was tarnishing and the teflon started to peel. Since this was made in China, most of the stuff is cheap material and not worth wasting your money on.Your best bet is to do it in water or I've had reasonable luck with the inserts that they sell in Bed & Bath or facsimile.	negative
title: The charges would be damning if only they were true [SEP] content: But as we've seen, O'Neill & Corsi's account is rapidly falling apart. In recent days we've seen evidence that O'Neill does have strong ties to the Bush family and there is even some question as to whether or not O'Neill even witnessed any of Kerry's actions in Vietnam. Corsi himself is also a rather non-credible source most notorious for his anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic statements posted on a conservative website the Free Republic. At this point there are too many veterans who are debunking the claims that the authors are making, and the authors themselves are far from credible. While it's true that every once in a while non-credible authors can speak the truth, it's usually a safe bet that they won't. If you're looking for truth, don't waste your money on this book.	negative
title: The horror, the horror... [SEP] content: ABC realizes they canceled the 24th most popular show on television. They pump out half a season of Galactica 1980. Pretend it never happened. Oh, Lord, say it never happened...	negative
title: A disappointing re-hash of the original. [SEP] content: At the end of "Jurassic Park", the dinosaur island was destroyed. Butit turns out that they're still alive on another nearby island.There's a different team of good guys whose well-planned operationturns to chaos, and a different team of bad guys who stop at nothingtrying to recover the gene-manipulation technology. Ian Malcom, themathematician, is back from the dead to wisecrack us with his chaos-theoretical predictions. There are two different kids getting drawninto the operation by accident, again demostrating that people beyondthe age of twelve are no good at operating modern computer systems.And of course there's the main ingredient: a good helping of dinosaurs;cute pet dinos as well as vicious beasts slashing and eating people alive.The plot moves along much too predictably. If you haven't read "JurassicPark", read it instead, it's so much more original. If you did read it,read it again; "The Lost World" might give you some bad deja-vus.	negative
title: Baby Einstein Music Car Mirror [SEP] content: The concept is great! Too bad the product doesnt work! I was so sure this was the perfect product for my baby and I...that I immediately gave my husband the fisher price monkey one I had. It may not have had frills, but at least it lived up to its function! This one always sounds like its on its last breath, even with new batteries! The remote has never worked! TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!	negative
title: Didnt work [SEP] content: It will not play it on my DVD player and it is too much hassle to send it back for another one. Sorry.	negative
title: Bad Translation [SEP] content: I am now almost completely through the entire book and need to post a review about the translation. While many reviews tout the excellence of the translation, I believe the translation is actually sub-par. I feel the paragraphs are choppy, and the sentences don't flow into each other. In addition, there are multiple spelling errors, including spelling one character's name incorrectly - multiple times within a single paragraph! These are simple things an editor could have fixed...	negative
title: So glad to still be able to find these! [SEP] content: Love my aircleaner. filters no longer available in store. a relief to find them here. it came right away, no problems.	positive
title: Not What I Expected [SEP] content: I received this pan..., I returned it... This pan was not what I expected. The pan is very thin, the lid doesn't weigh much more than several paper plates. The lesson I learned is to try to find cookware in a local store, inspect it, then if cheaper order on line. The only problem with this idea is that this pan was not available locally. I wouldn't suggest this piece to anyone.... If the price was [cheaper] it might be worth it. Don't think you are getting a great bargain, like I did, when you look at the regular price. It is a bargain pot at an inflated price.	negative
title: Koontz lost sight of the plot! [SEP] content: I read a lot of books, all genres, & used to be a big Koontz fan (back in the Watchers & Strangers days) but this book was awful. The description on the back cover did not jive with the book at all. Whatever was the point in Bartholomew losing his sight? Too many details that had no bearing on the plot. I couldn't take one more verbose paragraph about Edom & Jacob and their penchant for disasters...enough already! It appeared as though Koontz changed his direction midstream. Very disappointing & I do NOT recommend this book.	negative
title: What did they do????? [SEP] content: OK, to start I'll tell you the good and the bad.GOOD-It has cool cars. Driving missions, with a shooter?, thats cool. Another thing that is good is the graphics.Nice citys,and environments.BAD-To start the AI is the STUPIDEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. They run around like they dont know were they are going.Thats the biggest problem. Next the levels, AND the game are way too short. There is no blood. You cant run over people in the driving mission. You shoot the guys in the head and they dont die? STUPID!!!!I WOULD NOT ADVISE BUYING THIS GAME.	negative
title: Stories about the good old days. [SEP] content: If you want to read some poorly organized stories about Bob'sgood old racing days, this might be the book for you. If youwant to learn to drive quickly, this book will disappoint you.	negative
title: Awful, don't waste your time! [SEP] content: What the heck? What a awful movie! So depressing. I got a headache! It was the most pathetic movie I've ever seen! They had no will to live, totally passive. I got so irritated with this "so-called" movie. What a waste of my time!	negative
title: Marvelous! [SEP] content: This book was great. It was long, thick, and juicy. Everything a book should be. I couldn't put it down, but when I reached the end, I was sorry I was done, and wished I had read slower. This book was worth every penny... one word of advice, don't read this if you scare easy or late at night when you are at home along.. or if the power goes out.... just a tip. :)	positive
title: hot curling brush [SEP] content: This is a good hot curling brush. I only wish it had an auto turn-off - you know how frazzled you can be in the morning! This brush works very well though - heats well and is easy to use.	positive

title: p90x [SEP] content: p90x was sent to me on time in excellant condition. I have been using it and am withen 6 pounds of my goal weight...can see that muscle definition is built.	positive
title: boring [SEP] content: I read the book in 1 day. No, not because it was such a gread read that I couldn't put it down. I kept reading it because I was thinking it just has to get better. But that never happened. It's just a dull book.	negative
title: The world is a shopping mall. [SEP] content: The book is written in rhyme with a cadence closely resembling "One, two, buckle my shoe." It protrays a happy girl's life (Barbi's) revolving entirely around shopping, getting dressed and going out with boys. Ken has the presence of a manikin. There are many children's book that teach counting through rhyme and rhythm. Most that I have seen are more substantive, more human, and more fun than this book.	negative
title: I'm sorry, but [SEP] content: I loved Meg O'Brien's Jesse James series and was disappointed when they ended. I read Gathering Lies - the first O'Brien book I read since that first series and really liked the book. It was very good. But Crashing Down? I agree with one reviewer. The author should have just written her own life story instead trying to fit it into a suspense novel about other people. I found this book very dark and hard to get thru - meaning there just wasn't anything there - nothing compelling you to read. I made it to 2/3 thru and just skimmed the rest. I didn't like the character development of Nicky and I didn't get much in the way of a growing love relationship between Nicky and Callie. Her descriptions of the abuse scenes were chilling, especially since you knew from the forward that they were based on her own experiences, but the rest of the book seemed to be lacking something. I tried to read to the end, but just gave up.	negative
title: The perfect solution [SEP] content: The bracket mounts very securely to the side of the crate, and the bowl nests nicely in the bracket. No spillage at all, and water is constantly available to the dog.	positive
title: Lame and unfunny [SEP] content: There were some great characters in here but either the actors, script writers, or the director couldn't bring it together to make it funny and entertaining.	negative
title: The Bad Begining [SEP] content: This book is about three children named Violet,Klaus,and Sunny Baudelare. These three children live with an distant realitive named Count Olaf. The children live with him because there parents died in a horrable fire that burned down the house. Count Olaf wasn't very kind, they made them do many chores. But there is a kind lady that lives next door that becomes a friend at first sight. This story takes place in a city past Hazy Harbor in a town of Tedia, on Louse Lane an unpleasant road. During this story, many tragic events happen. If you're searching for a happy story, with a happily ever after ending this isn't the book you are looking for.	positive
title: Great shoe order 2 sizes smaller [SEP] content: Love the shoe, great for narrow feet, however I recommend going a full 2 sizes down, not the size and a half recommended. For my narrow feet, I needed 2 sizes down in the narrow still, but the draw string really helped fit my heels well unlike most shoes!	positive
title: the best war book ever [SEP] content: i like the poetic value of this book it makes it so you want to read it more than once .deffinitly a good buy.	positive
title: cool capacitor [SEP] content: its my first time using power acoustik brand and i can tell u the it works great i had this capacitor in my car and works awesome!	positive
title: Wonderful start, but got lost somewhere in the middle [SEP] content: A great fan since "Weaveworld", Clive Barker has never disappointed me, both in his writing as in his movies. Reading the back sleeve of his latest "Galilee" I counted to buy his best book so far, but how wrong a person can be. After an intriguing start, a tantalizing idea about the two opposing families and promises about a possible clash of godly forces, I was left with turns in the plot, characters and storyline that almost completely put me off. Too bad that a beginning so impressive can grow so stale, and takes so many pages to do so.	negative
title: Somebody needs to apologize! [SEP] content: SMH.... I watched Charlie Murphy's video, "I will not apologize" but someone damn well should! He's doing a stand-up show in Boston and it is not as funny as you would hope coming from Charlie Murphy. I did not laugh nor find humor in his video at all. On Dave Chapelle he was pretty funny, I am sure that is because he was backed by several comedians on the show, but he is doing a stand-up routine all by himself and he should really have some help because he bombed this one. I did not purchase this video from Amazon, so I cannot speak on delivery but I will say, save your money because this is a piece of garbage. I hope this helps...YMMV. NEOSOUL	negative
title: not as pictured [SEP] content: I bought this pendant assuming it would arrive as pictured. It does not have a bail - only a ring which is facing the opposite direction of the ring pictured. It is much smaller than I expected. I am not pleased.	negative
title: He liked Angels Glow better [SEP] content: After reading some reviews for Angels Eyes, I decided to try it. Bad decision. My shih-poo won't eat it when I mix it with yogurt like I did Angels Glow. Also, it doesn't say anything about cutting back on the dosage once the staining has stopped. I was only using the Glow every third day. It made a nice paste when mixed with yogurt that Harley would eat right off my finger. After reading more reviews, I'm going to order Tylan Powder (it's the main ingredient in both) and try it.	negative
title: Inexpensive product but poor sound [SEP] content: My old Sony broke so I purchased this one after reading several reviews. Quite frankly, the sound is surprisingly poor. Even my 5 year old Sony sounds better than this.1. Hiss: Listen to the radio and you will get this when the volume is turned on above 3. 2. Bass: It has XBS, but once you turn it on, 'bass' is going to dominate the music. 3. Clarity: For instrumental music such as jazz or classical, this does a decent job. However, when listening to vocal music, the high octaves sound as if someone recorded it using a very dull microphone.All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I think you could spend your [price]on something else.	negative
title: Long-lasting [SEP] content: I use these batteries in my electric toothbrush. After a few months of use, I noticed these batteries last much longer than the Duracell alkalines that I used to use.After four months of regular use, I've only had to change the batteries once. They've lasted so long, I haven't even gotten the opportunity to try out the charger yet.	positive
title: I was expecting a good movie [SEP] content: for the likes of it I was expecting a nice sci-fi, fighting movie with a lot of good stuff but then it turned into a mushy tale.This one is about Rutger Hauer and he is killed by his friend played by Mark Dacoscos and then he is brought back to life by scientists so he can kill his nemesis. sort of like The Crow as Hauer is killed and then he is brought back to life to avenge his death. theres nudity in this one	negative
title: A space mystery disappointment... [SEP] content: Normally I try not to read reviews before I get to read the book so that I am not prejudiced, for or against, by the reviews. Now I wish I had read the reviews as it would have saved me some time and money. I am a big McDevitt fan, but quite frankly this story left me "high and dry". The characters are well developed and even interesting, but the plot itself is so lame and the premise behind it is so preachy I found it often annoying. There is very little science in this "science" fiction novel. Indeed, it could easily have been written as a western or a 1930's film noir script. There is far more Sherlock Holmes, than Hawking or Einstein in the story. I hope McDevitt's future novels are more interesting than this one was, but then again it wouldn't take much.	negative
title: Not very good. [SEP] content: I am a history buff. I was disappointed in these. Same old archival footage that you have seen a hundred times before, and not any new insight on the battles. Boring. My advice is don't waste your money. If you know nothing of history, you might find them useful for understanding a history class, but very little here.	negative
title: Kiss of the Night [SEP] content: Absolutely enjoyed this book and all of the characters. Loved Vane's masculinity and his soft side, and thought Bride was wonderful. Look forward to actually reading more about Valerius after this book, when previously I couldn't stand him. I am new to this series, and am finding it gets better and better with each book!	positive
title: The best Rochester, the best overall...but an awful Jane [SEP] content: If you want to see an awesome Mr. Rochester, this film is a must-see. William Hurt gives a rich and layered performance as Rochester, really digging deep into the character and making us realize what a tortured man he is. His rendition of Rochester is unequaled.On the other hand, Charlotte Gainsbourg has nothing going for her except her looks. (Which is undoubtedly why she was cast; she very much looks the role.) Her Jane is wimpy, simpering, and even a little dumb. In short, she is not the Jane Eyre of the novel.The rest of the cast is quite good, the cinematography is lovely, the costumes great, etc. But for me, Ms. Gainsbourg's performance severely detracts from the film.	positive
title: There are better frech movies [SEP] content: Coming out is not an excuse to make poor movies like this one,it is slow nad ok when You are 20, but other then that is not really whort it, if You haven seen it, dont worry!	negative
title: excellent for little kids [SEP] content: This is my 4 years old's first ski trip,there's a lot stuff to buy.This goggle is inexpensive and fits well, 4 stars for the quality.	positive
title: PG at it's worst [SEP] content: This movie though rated PG is full of sexual comments and profanity. Daniel Stern even says Fu------dge. Unless you want your children to be taught the birds and the bees from a deviant loser I would steer clear of this Movie. In one scene all the boys are peeing on a man below for an extended amount of time. The children in it are entertaining overall, but Stern is an overboard actor. He is obviously acting the whole time, nothing about it is natural. The children do a decent job acting.If you are getting this for children, I would pick a different movie. I pitched my copy in the trash	negative
title: Meh. [SEP] content: For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas. We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away. I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight. It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky. To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast. I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it.	negative
title: CAPTIVATING [SEP] content: This is a movie I could watch over and over and never get tired of watching it and listening to the music -- I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a Willie Nelson fan !	positive
title: Horrible Software and Support [SEP] content: After using the Printer, which is a nice unit, I had numerous Software related functions that did not work on the Printer. I called HP for some help but found their Tech Support to one of the worst.I spoke with two (2) different techs who could not solve the problem and told me to contact Microsoft.I spoke to Dell and Microsoft who both spent time trying to solve the problem and both agreed that the problem was strictly an HP problem.I never solved the problem and returned the Printer to Amazon for credit.I am now using a Dell printer with no problems.	negative
title: Poor quality. [SEP] content: This item although is cute, the quality is sub-standard. The elastic in the sheets is barely there. The sheets come off every day. If I had more of a selection of kids sheets in a queen size, I would have never purchased this item.	negative
title: Mediocre effort [SEP] content: Some pretty good songs. Some songs just OK. And some just plain awful and NO songs on the same level as Lovin County or My Hometown. Overall a dissapointment.	negative
title: Proud Petunia Pleases [SEP] content: Petunia is a silly goose who finds a book and believes she'll be wiser if she's seen carrying it around. And the other barnyard animals actually think she *is* wiser because of it. The thing of it is, she's still just a silly goose, who gets her friends into all sorts of scrapes."Petunia" is a pleaser but gets a little too philosophical in the last two pages. That's okay-- the first pages and clean 1950s illustrations make up for it. A classic.	positive
title: I'm sorry but Kenyon will always be my favorite writer [SEP] content: I found this book to be amazing, as all her books! Any book with Acheron, Nick and the DH I will be buying as soon as it hits the shelf!	positive
title: Avoid This Book [SEP] content: I should have read the reviews on this book before reading it. I managed to finish it only because I kept hoping for Beatrice Lacey to come to her senses. The incest plotline, which captivated me in V.C. Andrews' works as a teenager, now repulses me and made me want to throw this book into a raging fire. I can only recommend this book to people who thrive on watching people self-destruct. I think the author was shooting for something similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde), and grossly missed the mark.	negative
title: it does sand wood, but. [SEP] content: I replaced my old mouse with this thing. It does sand wood, but the vacuum port does not fit either of my standard vacuums. The bag collects some dust but the motor cooling fan blows stray dust all over the shop like a hurricane! Had a few loose small items on the bench and some plane shavings etc. and the wind from the motor fan did a nice job of clearing off the bench! So the dust collection feature is nothing but a joke. I'll return this unit and go back to my old mouse thank you very much. Don't waste your time carrying this thing home if you need a dust collecting sander!	negative
title: Two years, broke down twice [SEP] content: We purchased this product based on consumer reports, ratings. Loved how roomy it was. Everything was fine till 1 year and 1 month. Stopped working. Amana agreed to fix it although it was outside the one year warranty after some conversation. Some electric part had melted.Now it is broken again after two years. Top shelf is not cold. We are told defrost board needs to be changed.Unfortunately it has not worked for us. On a positive note, it helps you clean out the fridge every year and start fresh :)	negative
title: Don't work very well. [SEP] content: For some reason, the cartridges do not seem to provide enough N20 to whip the cream sufficiently. I've been using this product for years and have never had this problem before. Perhaps the cartridges weren't filled to capacity. Don't know.	negative
title: The FORCE and where it all began... [SEP] content: I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book. I thought over the last 30+ years I have seen all the behind the scene photos, video and related available material and read all the trivia that has saturated the galaxy from STAR WARS. Well - I was wrong! - my eyes opened to more photos, more trivia, more details than I could possibly imagine - own this book and take your "FIRST STEP INTO A LARGER WORLD"I love seeing all the behind scenes photos, candid shots, shots of production and movie magic in the making ! Another book goes into my Star Wars collection, and I am sure it will not be my only one..."NO There is another!"The Making of The Empire Strikes Back ~ and I will own that as well.	positive
title: YES! [SEP] content: I actually purchased mine at another place, but that's ok!The upside to this machine (like others) YOU control what you're putting in the ice cream....you decide the quality of those ingredients. As the user of this product you are also able to control the quality of ice cream produced.I've been using mine for about 2 years. I can say, without a doubt, if you get "crappy" ice cream from this machine you better look in the mirror. I have made from crappy, to seriously THE MOST AMAZING ice cream I've ever had in my life in this machine. It's all about using the right ingredients, letting it churn just the right amount of time, and freezing it properly. It takes some time, but once you get that figured out you'll slap yourself every time you try and buy ice cream at the grocery store.Anyways, I'm a novice. This machine is pretty straight forward, easy to clean and maintain and I highly suggest it to anyone wanting to make home made ice cream.	positive
title: At East Wild Yam Cream [SEP] content: Originally received jar from sister and liked product. It helpswith unwanted facial hair if used regularly also.	positive
title: Funny [SEP] content: I liked this book. Mona is likable and the story kept me engaged. I will look for more books by this author.	positive
title: Good fun [SEP] content: I enjoyed this movie! Maybe not as well-rounded as my Big Fat Greek Wedding, but it's still a sweet, charming movie. Very feel-good and romantic with colorful and endearing characters. Not too deep, just good fun!	positive
title: Bad ingredients [SEP] content: After reading the ingredients I'm not so sure I wanted to this to be sprayed into the air that I breathe. I never used it.	negative
title: Number One Cats Fan Speaks [SEP] content: I spend a lot of time on Broadway and Off. I am always loking for good renditions of show tunes to add to my colection. I must admit that my tastes run to a very specific area, so I do not care for some of the songs on this CD, but that is not speak against Miss Church and her talents. The show tunes and one or two others I find very pleasant listening and I hope that someday she may find her way to the Bway stage. Even if you are just an old show girl like me the Cd is worth getting.	positive
title: Not happy [SEP] content: This grinder does not work well. It doesn't stick to cabinet as advertised, the food hangs up in it, and lets liquid run all over. I would not buy it ever again.	negative
title: Fortune-Telling: Reveal Inner Truths With the Tarot Nova and [SEP] content: This was a disappointing kit. You should know that you get a copy of Palm Reading : A Little Guide to Life's Secrets (Miniature Edition), which can be bought separately a couple of dead presidents. The description of the kit does not explain that you only get the miniature book on palms and the tarot deck and a pamphlet to describe the cards. The palm book is very basic and very limited in its graphics, which you need to explain palms. The deck is cute but very basic in its illustrations. This could be of interest to someone who knows nothing about either palm reading or tarot but don't bother if you want something with meat to it.	negative
title: Very disappointed! [SEP] content: I can not believe how many dog toy manufacturers get away with calling their products durable! Every bit of advertising for this product is directed toward how tough it is. In fact it is not at all, my Boxer had both ends chewed off and the stuffing pulled out in less than 30 minutes. I know toys aren't indestructible, but if I am going to spend this kind of money on a dog toy I expect it to last considerably longer than the ones priced much less. In short, do not waste your money if you have a large dog!	negative
title: good, hard to remove and put on [SEP] content: These shoes are perfect for camp. They clean easily and dry quickly. My son has gotten them a bit muddy though, and you have to make an effort to get the muck out from inside the toe, or his toes are totally disgusting at the end of the day. He can abuse them as much as he likes though, and they still look good. He likes them a lot, very comfortable	positive
title: Garbage Cables [SEP] content: Stay away from these cables. They have zero shielding. Artifacts galore onscreen! Stick with "Blue Rigger" cables!I bought 4 cables - they were all defective.GURU	negative
title: Excellent until it broke [SEP] content: I'd just like to mirror the comments of many other reviewers. I like my MuVo quite a lot, but after three months of use the Volume Down button has stuck semi-permanently making it very difficult to change tracks.If it were a reliable product it would be excellent.Dennis	negative
title: Great learning tool! [SEP] content: This book is a great learning tool it gives you the right information that is needed to prepare for the PHR.	positive
title: Real Music not PUNK!! Try Minor Threat if you need PUNK [SEP] content: Miss Murder and Rabbits on Road Kill are gems. Don't be afraid to admit it.. Long Like Winter and The Missing Flame show the band venturing in somewhat uncharted water.. The more you listen you will realize how lucky we are to have a band that is as interesting and talented as A.F.I.. I do listen to their old stuff from time to time, but lets be real-- Sing the Sorrow is close to a masterpiece as we are going to get nowadays. Decemberunderground is more evolution, lets hope they continue.	positive
title: mostly superb [SEP] content: Mr. Wallace isn't just funny (and he can be wickedly funny), he has a superb command of language, isn't afraid to use words, is beautifully observant, and has a great sense of character. All of those gifts have converged in a couple of these essays to make them, or parts of them, utterly memorable. Unfortunately, there are some long dead moments within each essay that make me stop and think, Now here's an example of really bad judgment. What's unfortunate is that Wallace's mistakes tarnish the lustre of his finer moments. Without the extreme bad here, though, we might not also have the extreme good. And in the end it's worth it. There are a few writers who always get grouped together with Wallace in literary commentary, but not a single one of can hold a candle to this guy.	positive
title: not worth THAT much! [SEP] content: The comics by Yumi Tsukirino are very cute and I would recommend them, but not for $300! If the seller isn't willing to part with it for a normal price (I see these books costing about $5 each!) then they shouldn't have it up for sale at all. That's ridiculous.	negative
title: Great shipping from vendor, Decent pad [SEP] content: Ordered and received with-in days so kudos to the vendor. Also got a two inch pad. Between the two the 3 inch is better if you are a bigger adult. I have a 4 inch pad I bought a few years ago which I like better as it is a higher rated memroy foam. At 5.5 you can tell this is memory foam, but it isn't quite up to the higher rated pad. For the price though it will revive an old or cheap matress and make it liveable. These various memory foam (vs just foam) have helped my back a lot and I would recommend these types of products. Thicker (3"-4") and higher density foam is better. (the two shredded pillows actually aren't too bad either which was a suprise.)	positive
title: Brake controller [SEP] content: This controller works well for the price. After determining the settings (both loaded and unloaded) for the various trailers I tow, setting the controller for each trailer is a snap. The only thing that would make it better was if it had memory settings so I wouldn't have to keep my cheat sheet in the truck.	positive
title: Love this thing! [SEP] content: We got this for my son to make trail foods, but have been using it to dehydrate lots of stuff. Apple, pear, banana chips. Fruit leathers. Jerky. Veggies. Almost anything you would put in a jar for canning.Likes: Simple to use. Easy food prep. Jerky gun works great. Cheap to operate.Dislikes: If the jerky gun was 1/2" to 1" longer it would hold a 1/2 lb. As is you have an extra refill cycle, adds maybe a minute to your process time.Definite recommended product!	positive
title: Unique [SEP] content: We were one of your first customers from 20 years ago and have saved tons of money and have had great experiences because each B&B is unique, we continue to tell hundreds of people.	positive
title: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.... [SEP] content: This book is the perfect cure for insomniacs. Not recommended for those new to French history. History should be written by great story tellers and not by the Sandman!	negative
title: Green Beret DVD Does Not Work [SEP] content: For the third time the DVD did not play. It stopped 1/2 to 3/4 of the way thru. I thought I was getting it from another vendor but apparently not. I didn't bother sending it back the 3rd time.	negative
title: In Plain Sight [SEP] content: This is a new author for me. I read the first book in the Ivy Malone series and had to quickly read all four to finish the series and I wished for another. I enjoy reading her books. I hope you will give them a try you will find them fun reading too.	positive
title: Sizzla's best album yet! [SEP] content: This is Sizzla's best work as a artist, he should make more albums with this vibe. One Love!	positive
title: What? [SEP] content: I'm not sure why the description above mentions the inner city when it had nothing to do with it. Two brothers and a friend who've grown up together become hired hit man for mobsters. The conscience of one starts playing tricks on him and another one wants out of the game after a particular murder. I guess the producers of this film were trying to put out a psychological thriller but it was psychological flop. One of the actors seemed like he got high right before shooting the scenes, the annoying little sister with no acting skills that I was hope would get killed by one of the brothers, and the second half of the movie with one of the actors playing opposite himself as his conscience, was entirely too much to stand. And what does the title have to do with the movie?	negative
title: Misleading condition [SEP] content: I decided to purchase this product "New," with the guarantee that it was "factory sealed," and when the VHS arrived it was clear that the factory sealing was around a very used video. It not only had a "Sale $4.99" sticker on the slip cover, but it also had a "50 cent charge if not rewound" sticker directly on the video. Had I known I was getting a used video anyway I would have simply paid the lower price!	negative
title: Britney watch a little bit of Gaga! [SEP] content: I have seen at the same time both Lady Gaga's Monster Ball and this Femme Fatale. Britney's performance and intensity looks so poor when compared with Lady Gaga. She should play live, and not use recorded voice. When she dances it feels like a robot she should put more emotion. All in all, the songs are good, but I can't find the spirit of this show.	negative
title: Essential Reading for the Student of Christianity [SEP] content: If one really wants to know what the early church was like, written by an intellect who was actually there, not a historian, this book is essential. Amazingly many, many topics of current interest, if not debate, were addressed millenia ago in the early church. Here one will find their origins and the early discussions. No student of Christianity should be without reading this book.	positive
title: Doesn't work for a lazy susan. [SEP] content: I should have read the reviews! Not only does the product details claim this lock works on lazy susans, the picture they use is showing it on a lazy susan! Well, I just put the lock on and I can only rotate my lazy susan a quarter of the way. I will also be mourning the loss of my $7 and be seaching for another lock.	negative
title: If you are looking for Christian music to exercise to, skip this DVD [SEP] content: I have dome several Leslie workouts, and continue to do them even though I am not thrilled with the music. This DVD has similar moves and workouts, but the music, with the exception of "Here I am Lord" is not discernably Christian music, which is why I bought the DVD to start with; it's some bad take on Disco music. "Here I Am Lord" is not music that fits in very well with the workout either. At he beginning of the DVD when the song is used, there is no beat to work out to. In short, if you need a different workout DVD this DVD weuld be OK but do not buy it if you are interested in working out to Christian music.	negative
title: Great read [SEP] content: My daughter, who is ten, loves this series. She has read both book one and book two and can't wait to read the additional two in this series.	positive
title: cool baby book [SEP] content: Three years ago I purchased the coolest baby book ever so when I found out we were expecting I thought I would never find another one.This book is the three year brother to my first(same maker and designer) although I didn't know it when I bought it online. It is a three ring binder with all the essentials of a baby book but also has plastic paper holders and several pages for photos. My first son's book has turned out wonderful so far and I think this one will be just the same.I am looking forward to adding wonderful memories and photos to this book for my second son.	positive
title: Not a replacement ignition switch [SEP] content: This item description is not accurate and is misleading. I thought I was buying a replace ignition switch assembly for a Geo Tracker.This item is an inertial cutoff switch to interrupt fuel flow in a crash (this item is in addition to a normal functional factory ignition switch system). NOWHERE IN THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS THIS INFORMATION GIVEN. I am now stuck with this useless item due to the 30 day refund policy.	negative
title: Very wearying tale of nonstop bloodshed [SEP] content: I'm a fan of Miike, but _Izo_ is just too much. There's no plot whatsoever, just a poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time and space and killing everyone who crosses his path. That's it! End of sentence! If you think you can stand over two hours of this, give it a try. If you're looking for something with even a rudimentary plot, you might want to try something else, like _Audition_ or _Ichi the Killer_. I'd rather watch the incomprehensible _Gozu_ again than be forced to sit through _Izo_. It is a beautifully-photographed, but ultimately pointless film. Maybe the 6th or 7th other film Miike directs this year will be more interesting.	negative
title: Do Not Buy This Product! CHIPS PAINT!!! [SEP] content: My Husband is a researcher, it does not matter what it is he researches everything before he buys anything. He read all the reviews and short of putting a hitch on the back of my 2006 Honda Accord (which is what we bought today)he thought this was the best product for the money. The first thing we discovered was that this bike rack does not work well at all with a spoiler. We put the top of the rack below the spoiler at first and it came loose after 10 mins on the road, so we decided to put it above the spoiler, which did not work out well either but did hold. When we returned home and took the bike rack off I have 3 pea sized chips of paint scraped off the back of my car. I will highly upset about that. This happened on the bottom part where the pads are suppose to prevent that from happening. I would not recommend anyone buy this product unless they want to touch up the paint on their car.	negative
title: Really small-check dimensions [SEP] content: This item came on time, and in good condition.I failed to read the dimensions of this book,and was surprised when it was a little tiny book.Would be a nice Easter Basket Gift, or Trick or Treatsurprise.	positive
title: Make it stop! [SEP] content: Anytime a washed-up celebrity tries to grab the spotlight again with a music "album" (and I use that term loosely), it inevitably results in disaster. This is no exception. What hubris it must take to put out crap like this.Oh, and quote: "Corey's legendary acting ability has been well known for years." Corey - is that you?	negative
title: Dissapointing Re-Edit [SEP] content: During a recent discussion of erotic movies (not to be confused with Erotica) with a friend, we decided that this movie was one of our favorites and decided to order it. Having seen it only twice myself when it appeared on HBO in the late seventies, it remained in my memory as very erotic though not terribly well acted. The cut available (R rated) from this site is not the same cut I, nor my friend saw when viewed shortly after it's original release and I'm reasonably sure that even in it's raw, formative stages, HBO wasn't airing an X-rated version. If you're looking for the steamy, sexy version you remember, this aint it!	negative
title: great product [SEP] content: The Hamsa was just like I expected. I had already ordered one before and the service was just as great. The delivery was very fast. Thank you so much.	positive
title: Better than a vacation [SEP] content: In a world of the sad, the bad and the ugly, Monarch of the Glen is the best vacation from the daily drearies: and you only pay the price of the vids. Gorgeous scenery, excellent acting, clean comedy, it's a morale boost for when the frustrating bits of life get you down... and you don't even have to put your dog in the kennel and use up your vacay days from work.Recommend it with the highest of ratings. Watch it once a year and you will rarely want to spend another pence on petrol prices. Unless of course, you absolutely must visit Loch Laggan in the Spey Valley of the Scottish Highlands where this series was filmed.Grab your scones and single malt for an evening of pure escapism.	positive
title: Not worth the time [SEP] content: Does not work like it should. To much time trying to figure it out and then you get very minimal results.	negative
title: Cheap and works [SEP] content: We're upsold stuff we don't need all the time, this stopwatch breaks that trend. You could spend $50+ on a Robic but why? You'll never use all those functions. This is simple, fits in the hand and has good action on the buttons.	positive
title: Wish I could give zero stars! [SEP] content: Mr. Kupelian appears to be the one promoting evil here. Bigotry, intolerance, and HIS elitism over minorities in society is disgusting! Disguising hatred as freedom is his evil.	negative
title: Entertaining [SEP] content: This is an entertaining history of the Elm Creek area and it's participation in the Underground Railroad before the Civil War.	positive
title: wrong blanket [SEP] content: It looks fine, but... When I saw the composition, I couldn't believe it.I received 55%wool & 45% synthetic, instead 70%wool.Maybe wrong shipment???	negative
title: The Price Of Self-Indulgence [SEP] content: This book is noticeably more psychological than the author's other novels, but just as suspenseful and engaging. The story deals primarily with the misuse of technology for fulfillment of desire. The characters must deal with a proverbial alien vehicle that changes the human that touches it. Tension throughout the book leads up to a heart pounding ending.It is not the most uplifting, ideal novel, but it's fun recreational reading.	positive
title: Meaty [SEP] content: Though I did not find this one to be an easy read, it is by far the meatiest (other than the Bible itself) book on Kingdom Theology. It isn't really for new believers, but I would definitely recommend it for any person looking to really define their faith. Beware though, it will take time to get through it.Also, this book has been the biggest step to my faith this year.	positive
title: Sorry about the confusion [SEP] content: yipeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!! this was good. I espesially liked that one song by Rammstein. I also liked that one by Rage. the others are crap exept Club to death which has kind of a morbid title but it rocks your socks. oooooooooooooooooooo mayralin manson is a he/she. when i was listning to Club to death I tried to do t. the matrix sound track was good. i thought the matrix soundtrak was totally rad. just kidding. but not really.	positive
title: A horrible printer [SEP] content: I cannot find anything good to report about this printer, except that it was easy to set up. All of the moving parts just feel cheap and junky, like they are ready to break at any moment. The print cartridges jam about 50% of the time. Photos are printed crooked on the paper (on a slight diagonal). There are orange and yellow lines through the middle of the photos. I have had so much wasted paper because the printer decides to spit out sheets of random letters at any time. This printer is going back.	negative
title: does this game really suck THIS BAD??? [SEP] content: i've "played" this game for about 3 hours now (walking around killing wolves, digging through dungeons). yeah, it's early, but i won' tbe giving it much more attention if it doesn't get a WHOLE LOT better. i'm running around outside kvtach doing a little sword dance against tan pooh colored pointy eared guys and i can't even tell if i'm hitting them or not. they're hitting me though. load times SUCK, graphics (animations) suck, i can't be bothered with the lame-assed story line cuz i'm so fed up from the rest of the crapiness, and i had to go through shopping at Gamestop to get this ("do you have a card? wanna be a memeber? want insurance? i beat this game in two days. the best part was..."),i'd think this was a complete scam if so many people weren't over the moon about this game. what am i missing? the good news is i'm not bummed about getting th regular version now since i'll hardly be wasting any more time on this one. neat red sky though. pfft. rip off.	negative
title: Coolest music ever recorded [SEP] content: Dean Martin had style, confidence and incredible charisma. Add his laid-back velvet vocals and you have the ultimate easy listening CD with this compilation of the best of his years at Capitil and Reprise. All the classics are included here - Everybody Loves Somebody, Return To Me, You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You - and in my opinion, his greatest recording - Ain't That A Kick In The Head. This CD is perfect to unwind with after a hard day at work - kick off your shoes, sit back and relax!	positive
title: A note to all of you ANGRY fans [SEP] content: The reason this is not true to the game as much as you wanted it to be is becuase he had to write it before the game was released. So shut up about that.	negative
title: beautiful [SEP] content: This was a wonderful collection. My only complaint is the last story is written as it would have been spoken, which is great if your Scottish, but being I couldn't figure it out.	positive
title: A Little Of Everything [SEP] content: More than just recipes, this book also includes several sections writing about the region and it's relationship to cooking techniques. Also included are explanations of many ingredients, unique to Mediterranean cooking.The book is full of scenic Mediterranean pictures and pictures of the food as per recipe. And this is all done in an overall good balance, with respect to the actual recipes.A hard-core recipe book, it is not. But for someone new to this type of cooking, it is a great primer, that also gives you a little peak into this part of the world.	positive
title: An excellent book to grow up with [SEP] content: This book is wonderful for children from ages 2 and up. My 2 year old is not yet ready to learn definitions, but the book is filled with colorful, easy to see pictures, in which he can identify his beloved Sesame Street characters, as well as the activities that they portray. This is one of the few books that he doesn't want to put down. So many pages makes it something new each and every time we pick it up. I cannot tell you the extent of the knowledge he has gained from this book. Several of his daycare teachers have told me how amazing he is in what he knows and comprehends for a child his age. His knowledge and perception of things took off immediately following our Sesame Street Dictionary reading sessions. This is a book that will continue to give as he grows older and begins learning the concepts and definitions of these words, not to mention when he begins reading and writing!	positive
title: Didn't work for me [SEP] content: The twist to fit concept intrigued me. Thought it was the answer to my problems in a decent fitting headphone for my ears. I thought wrong. If you have ears of size you feel is a little different don't buy these. Couldn't tell you about the sound quality. Since they didn't fit properly I sent them right back.	negative
title: it didnt work I sent it back and the person who sent understood the problem and full refund. [SEP] content: it didnt work ! I am still looking for ine that works I had one enjoyed playing it now i want another one/	negative

[SEP] content: As a strength training professional, I heartily recommend this book as a great place to start your journey to your muscular fitness goals. Its greatest value is the identification of specific regimens for specific body types. Every woman is different and should be trained according to her frame and metabolic tendencies. Kennedy and Greenwood-Robinson have done a very admirable job at provide great examples from the major body types and the pictures are tasteful and inspiring. Good work!	positive
title: Packed with astonishing persuasion techniques [SEP] content: Everybody whose success depends on their ability to persuade owes it to themselves to acquire this unique know-how. And if you want to be sure you can resist unwanted persuasion, you'd be wise to familiarize yourself with this powerful methods so you can protect yourself against them. Donovan's techniques really work.	positive
title: Just a Little Extra Reach [SEP] content: Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible. If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition. The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies. You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice.	positive
title: disapointed with content [SEP] content: This CD was surposed to be about the year 1932.There were weird clips about events that were not introduced well and not at all informative.There was more raw info about the year on the back cover but content was terrible.Nothing about what things cost back then, sports info, state of the U.S., or the world.It was a waste of money.	negative
title: Soft Natural History [SEP] content: Well-written, but the author's grasp of "real nature" seemed rather slight and superficial. Clearly more literary than natural-historical. On the other hand, the doctored Polaroids that illustrate the book--very clever!	positive
title: The Vow [SEP] content: I love the story behind this movie even before I saw the movie which I love so ,When the Blu ray edition came out I had to have it to add to my collection. This is a movie for Anyone that has ever been in Love or wants to be in Love, It renews you hope that True love does exist and flourishes in today's crazy world	positive
title: Who's singing? [SEP] content: I was very disappointed in this CD - I didn't hear the distinctive Bryan Ferry voice I love. I played it once, not even to the end & haven't played it since.	negative
title: Excellent for Art Teachers [SEP] content: I teach K-4 art and this book could not be better for my unit on patterns! The kids absolutely love following along with the patterns as I read. As we look it over a second time, I challenge them to find the patterns in the pictures (the book is overflowing with them) which really helps solidify the concept visually. Administration loves any excuse for the support teachers to incorporate literacy into our lessons so the book really is a perfect fit. Even the kids who are a struggle to get to participate in most things love adding the "POP" and "SHARK!"as we read. I highly recommend Pattern Fish to anyone - fun to read and see the kiddos really getting into it.	positive
title: the kind of game when ya wanna brake the controller [SEP] content: When i got this game o was so excited as i had played the first medal of honor: Frontline, which was an awesome game, this game is so crappy, it's unbelievable, graphics are N64 compatible, voices are all of sync with the person who's talking, oh and dont even get me started on the controlles for the game, they are so messed up, you will spend half the time you play the game just trying to figure out how to play it, overall this game is just another one of those games that ends up with a broken controller.	negative
title: Wonder why this book has just come out now?????? [SEP] content: Terrible, just terrible! Shows just how fearful the members of one party have become that they have to try to smear another candidate's good name and war record. Whatever happened to truth, honesty and fair play? It's a sad commentary on today's U.S. politics.	negative
title: Stand Up Blows [SEP] content: Everyday Sunday is amzing for the fact that they got an A&R drunk enough to give them a record contract. Maybe they're related, I'm not sure. But this cd is terrible. I like Hanging On and Stand Up.	negative
title: Kristen's review [SEP] content: I like this book because it is interesting and different from others that I have read. Also I like it because the book is about a future that is not real. There are no animals in their make-believe world. The people can't make choices. That is why I like the book.The book is about a boy named Jonas. It's about how he was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. He and the Receiver try to think of a way to change their community. The people in the community lie about things and don't know that it is wrong. Jonas and the Receiver are the only ones who know that they are lieing and they know they're not doing things that are right.Who would enjoy this book are people who like some drama. If you like people try to do the right thing even if they have to break law in your books and all the others than you may like this book.	positive
title: 5 line retractable clothes line [SEP] content: This clothes line is working great for me. The receiving handle had to be bent to allow the handle of the clothes line to fit into it, but other than that it is perfect!	positive
title: Rare part/Cheap price--WRONG PART!! [SEP] content: I have looked all over the place for this part and could only find a small number of places that sell this hub--without ABS. And this is by far the cheapest. Most other prices were above $200 and a couple were even above $300. I suggest you purchase from here, you might be searching for a while to find a price this low.--SPOKE TOO SOON--READ COMMENT	positive
title: Starts well. Ends poorly [SEP] content: The structure of the characters were interesting. Less written would have been an improvement. Too much warm up. Author could have shortened the manuscript. I fell asleep reading this one. Better luck next time. A tint of Greek methology. Life in the 90's???? Give me the 20's to'59	negative
title: harold melvin & the blue notes 15 all- time greats [SEP] content: I was very disappointed with this CD. It was remakes and live music, and the remakes were terrible. I don,t think that Teddy Pendergrass was even on this cut.I would not recommend this CD.	negative
title: Excellent product at a good price! [SEP] content: After comparing prices from a number of sellers, this is the best price to be found. Plus the product is the same as those selling for a much higher price. Amazon has been very consistent in its quality of products it offers along with very high quality service.	positive
title: Forget my last review [SEP] content: This book is bad,why because native americans have an oral tradition of their beliefs they do not write about it in books.	negative
title: Does exactly what It needs to [SEP] content: This product does exactly what it is listed to do. I replaced my 512mb stick with this and my machine runs faster, simple as it can get. Also, The Game.	positive
title: Kindle edition is awful [SEP] content: I bought the kindle edition and the reading has been a nightmare. Two main reasons:1. Why do they keep referencing page numbers (i.e. see pag. 287). How the hell I am supposed to go to that page in my kindle!2. The mathematical symbology craps. Many formulas are wrong, symbols lost, exponents lost...I think Amazon relies too much in OCR software for the scanned documents and this software is definitively deficient with math symbols. In addition, if someone at Amazon would have read the kindle edition they would never have offered it to the public!	negative
title: Excellent Debut Album, Top 10 of 2008! [SEP] content: After Edmund is a great example of the new wave of Christian rock bands that have come out in the last few years. Similar sound to MuteMath, The Fray and Snow Patrol on the mainstream side (all favorites of mine) and Leeland, Deas Vail and Ruth (my favorite new Christian bands). "Thank God" kicks it off, and I find "Fighting For Your Heart" "Come and Rain Down" and "Like A Dream" to be the other highlights. Excellent debut album and top 10 of 2008 in my opinion!	positive
title: pitiful [SEP] content: Has not given me any indication of fuel in tank or left.. magnet works poorly. not recommended, i would get something that weighs the tank	negative
title: The Man of Steel' girlfriend never looked worse! [SEP] content: Quite simply not worth the space this review would take up. And can someone stop this Adrian character writing those aweful Margot Kidder reviews.	negative
title: Ice Cold... [SEP] content: Being DIE HARD WIGGLES fans, we purchased Cold Spaghetti Western because it was the WIGGLES... Don't waste your money.It's pretty bad and usually they are right on! My three kids (2,3,4 yrs) left the room!?! Usually, they are GLUED to the Wiggles. Too much talking, not enough songs, and a inconsistent "plot." Try Top of the Tots, Wiggle Bay, Hoop de Doo, or even Space Dancing before buying this one!	negative
title: After looking at both Ipad and Kindle [SEP] content: I decided to buy Ipad. It is a multipurpose device that is light weight and had long battery> I enjoy the nice color screen that Kindle does not provide. And if you really want to buy an ebook from amazon you can do still do so on Ipad but not the other way around.	negative
title: Very Good Album!! [SEP] content: This is a very good album by Helix. Certainly not their best work, but that's a testameant to the band, not a knock on this album. The songs are rock n' Roll without a doubt, but with a very melodic and catchy tone to them. I guarantee you'll be enthralled by the deeply hypnotic "Storm". You'll be singing along with "Midnight Express" and "Rockin' Rollercoaster". Of course, that's only the beginning...I could go on and on, but I won't. I recommend this album	positive
title: Individualism begins to melt away [SEP] content: More stellar cuts from a truly inspired session Coltrane held in October of 1960 was perhaps overshadowed by counterpart MFT, though the quality on both nearly remain interchangeable...not quite up to anointed levels of his most provocative quartet days, but injecting a fresh edge into structural predictabilities so as to render them new once again.	positive
title: Nothing against Celine [SEP] content: The music on this album is just great. Celine is one of the greatest artists in the world. [...]	negative
title: Doesn't clean silver jewelry [SEP] content: I bought this product specifically to clean my silver jewelry, which came out of the basket just as tarnished/oxidized as when it went in. Cheap toothpaste and a toothbrush works better - I'll stick to that from now on.	negative
title: Machete [SEP] content: Danny's performance in Desperado was more "down to earth" and entertaining than his role in Machete. Yes, action, violence, and gratuity sex are in this film; however, the director makes Danny take the action to beyond earth heights and far into fantasy. Attempts to suspend disbelief does nothing to regard Danny's knife scenes beyond comical or at best on a par with the wonderous flying martial arts actors who blithly skip on water in Chinese films. Danny is a solid character actor who deserves a better director. The film will make one question their blood lust motives.	negative
title: wonderful tale [SEP] content: This was my favorite cartoon movie as a child and now I look forward to sharing the endearing tale with my son!	positive
title: Remarkably Functional [SEP] content: I brought this camera to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,200 ft) in sub-freezing tempertures. It took picutures beautifully and survived the difficult journey intact. Buy lithium batteries (per manufacturers recommendations) and you don't have to replace them as often.	positive
title: A Better Choice [SEP] content: The music on this CD all sounds the same. I bought & really enjoy her other album "come as you are" & recommend it to everyone.	negative
title: Forced To Write A (Truthful) Review [SEP] content: Ok, so I was just gonna watch the movie, keep my thoughts to myself and get on with my life... until I saw some pretty outlandish reviews. I thought, "Those poor zombie-lovin' folks are gonna fall right into that trap of thinking this is a great movie unless someone stops them!" Someone's gotta set the record straight."The Rising Dead" is your basic low-budget zombie flick and like so many others, falls prey to the same elements, over and over again. The shaky acting, the thin, drawn-out script, etc. "Fast paced action"? It's about as fast-paced as a lullaby. I will be honest, the movie does boast an attractive cast, and I will give them points for their attempt at special effects. Also, filming in the lush tropical jungle was nice but don't be deceived. "The Rising Dead" probably won't make any Top 10 Lists.	negative
title: good quality [SEP] content: I just have the pedal 3 weeks now, its responding well on foot movement. Kick sound ist hard, and there is a plastic side too that can be set to be the kicking point of the mallet, the mallet is square formed not round. For what I play it is too hard, but thats always so, I am more into classical percussion and Jazz, I simply put some cloth around it to make it sound softer. For Hardrock I play it as it is, without softening.Nothing to say about log term quality, but it seems sturdy.	positive
title: Junk [SEP] content: The only thing I asked for Christmas was a foot spa. Be careful what you ask for. Like the other reviewers have stated, it doesn't maintain water temperature AT ALL! The water gets darn near cold within 5 minutes. The extra attachments are a waste. It's an overall COMPLETE disappointment. I should have done more research. Now that I have... I'm taking this back and buying the HotSpa Foot Bath with Water Heat Up. All the reviews from all the websites I've researched say that the HotSpa heats VERY well and you can add salts,and soaks and whatnot to the water. You can find it cheaper than the Brookstone which I understand also maintains water temperature well.	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: I recently received "50 Splenda Recipes" By Marlene Koch and was very disappointed. As I began reviewing the recipes I realized that the ingredient amounts had been cut off. As anyone knows, a recipe is no good without the amounts. My husband was recently diagnosed with diabetes and this book was important to us. Thanks for reading this review. Debra Bennett	negative
title: Great office relief [SEP] content: I have muscle tightness in my neck 24/7, and working on my computer all day isn't helping to relieve it. I pop my elasto gel in the microwave and use it at least twice at work. It does its job. You just have to keep reheating it because it cools down easily.	positive
title: Candy's Best Studio CD [SEP] content: This is probably Candy Dulfer's best studio recordings. My personal favorite is "Gititon", a very funky composition. However, to truly appreciate Candy, you need to see/hear her live. Unfortunately, her best CD, "Live in Amsterdam", is not (yet) available in the U.S. Listening to her playing live shows that she is more than just a (very) pretty face. For instance, the studio recording of "For the Love of You" is good, but the live version featuring Angie Stone is outstanding. So buy this CD and pick up the live CD on your next trip to Europe!	positive
title: At the crossroads [SEP] content: This book is rated 1.5 stars. That's too high for trash like this. It hurts me a little to make that comment, being an avid WOT fan and all, but it's the brutal truth. By now whoever's reading this has probably heard about the flaws of this book so I won't go into great detail on the matter. Instead I'll just give a short summary of the problems: 1 dimensional characters, stalled plot, uninteresting scenario's and an overall sense of bordom are what make this book so terrible. Literally nothing happens. I don't care to speculate on why Robert Jordan's works have declined so much in quality over the past few years, it's really not important. The fact is once he was a great writer, now he's not. Like many of Jordan's long time fan's, I'll definetly think about whether or not I'll pick up the next book in the series.	negative
title: This book is for unglazed clay dishes, please note [SEP] content: A solid book of recipes, but I wish before I had ordered it that I'd known that it's solely for unglazed clay pot cooking, such as with a Romertopf - and that's actually the pot that is discussed in the introduction. Unglazed pot cooking is great, and one day I will purchase a Romertopf or similar, but for now I have two new glazed cazuelas and an olla de barro. I'm sure the recipes will work just fine; I'm just a bit disappointed in the narrowness of the target audience.	positive
title: Good story [SEP] content: Good story, not for everyone though. Definitely sex-oriented (of the guy on guy persuasion) at times. If you are amused by goth culture, this book is likely to be at least entertaining to you (I can so see people I've met in each of the groups described). Constantine's descriptions are very vivid and pleasing to read.	positive
title: One Touch Uploading [SEP] content: If you like simplicity in a camera, EasyShare might be a good choice for you. The base charges the battery, holds the camera safe and easy to find on your desk, and uses a USB port to connect to your computer. To upload pictures, simply touch the button on the base. Easy as that.	positive
title: Amazing Sound for a 60s Classic [SEP] content: I have owned numerous releases of the vinyl and CDs of this album over the years, and I would have to say this is the best sounding one of them all. The packaging is top notch as well, with the CDs encased in a great box that replicates the front and back covers of the original album.The music itself is great, of course. As it would turn out, this would be the only real album legendary guitarist Jeff Beck would record with the Yardbirds. Shortly after this released, the Yardbirds lost Paul Samwell Smith, gained Jimmy Page, and then lost Jeff Beck. For a short time, Beck and Page led a two pronged guitar attack, which two of the best songs on this collection, "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago" and "Psycho Daisies," capture. It always leaves me to wonder what could have been if only the Beck/Page era had lasted longer.	positive
title: Unhappy customer [SEP] content: I bought the guitar from my son. He loved it at Christmas. However, the strings were always moving out of the slots. Therefore it needed to be tightened. When tightened the whole neck of the guitar broke!! The guitar did not last long at all:(	negative
title: Unreadable [SEP] content: This is an overlong book made worse by sloppy writing. The same distant, cold style is used for both technical descriptions and supposedly ardent human interactions. It's like reading one of those pseudo-English user manuals that come with overseas audio equipment. The reader is left clueless as to which characters/ideas are important and which aren't. Everything is painted with the same brush. Combine that with less substance than can sustain a long novel and tedium sets in very soon. I admit I gave up on the book after 300 pages.	negative
title: Excellent [SEP] content: A great story with wonderful characters! The Bestseller is fascinating and fun, especially if you are interested in the publishing industry. Very entertaining!	positive
title: Deeply disturbing [SEP] content: According to Rachel's parents, the God they believe in fore-told and allowed the slaughter of innocents so that His message of love and redemption could be spread around the world. What a disturbing image that creates. It certainly is not a God I care to worship. They claim to quote Rachel's journals, in which they believe she wrote of God's prophecy about her coming death and the death of twelve others. If these are indeed Rachel's journals, it's possible that she was experiencing some type of premonition. How disturbing to think that she did not feel confident enough to tell someone. We cannot speculate about what might have happened, but to know that she kept such feelings to herself begs the question "Why?" Finally, the self-promotion of her parents and people like Bruce Porter at her innocent expense is the most disturbing element of all. Rachel, like the others, did not deserve to die. Neither does she deserve this continuing exploitation by people who love her.	negative
title: Very short lived product [SEP] content: I bought this antenna from an Amazon vendor after comparing reviews of similar antennas. My experience is only one data point, but this antenna functioned for only a bit more than a month before failing. It was mounted on the cowl of my Toyota Landcruiser, so not in a place of extra ordinary heat, vibration or other conditions that I would have thought might cause failure in a product purportedly intended for use on a vehicle or vessel.For the short time it did work, it was not noticeably better than a less expensive Garmin auxiliary antenna I owned previously. The Garmin died after about 18 months, and was mounted in a similar spot on my Range Rover Classic.For the record, this vendor warrantied the antenna and offered an immediate replacement.	negative
title: Will not play on Computer CD Drive [SEP] content: I have over 230 CDs from many different artists (including Mike Oldfield). This is the ONLY one that will not read on a computer because of the NAZI security features! I am a huge Mike Oldfield fan but I cannot transfer this to my mp3 player like every other CD I own. I can't even buy an mp3 of this album! Complete BS! Nothing wrong with making mp3's if it is for my own personal use (no sharing). Wish I had never purchased this!	negative
title: Absolute, best compilation I've ever heard [SEP] content: This is, as noted above, the best compilation I have ever heard - of any style of music. I haven't heard the album in probably three years, but the trax are so darn haunting - I still have the loops running through my head when I think of this album. This was my first exposure to trance/ambient, and I have been dissapointed with every trance album I've purchased since, because I have still not found its equal in fluiduty, addiction, or in being solid through the entire journey.	positive
title: It's like comparing a 4 cylinder to a V8 [SEP] content: Much less power than my old WaterPik even at the highest power level.The stream of water is very weak although the motor is much quieter than my old one.I'm disappointed.	negative
title: Too Many Other Good Things To Do [SEP] content: Gave this movie forty-five minutes, but it was so slow moving and seemingly pointless -- okay boring -- I gave up. Don't waste your time.	negative
title: Villaware Waffle Maker V2001C [SEP] content: Most noteworthy feature of this quality heavy duty family waffle maker is its quick recovery - the 2nd, 3rd, 4th batches cook as quickly as the first. This is not typical of all competitors' waffle makers and buyers who intend to cook for a family should consider this when comparison shopping. I bought through Amazon because this model was recommended to me, and I could not find it in any local store. Too bad there was no choice of shipping options, I received it in 2 days but at a very high "shipping cost" - could have waited longer for a less expensive method.	positive
title: white too light [SEP] content: Love this heating pad and the size is good for my back. The color white on the cover gets dirty too fast. i would like a dark color as I have seen on other pads such as dark blue.	positive
title: Great item for a great price! [SEP] content: I was a bit unsure at first, but this product was definitely worth the buy. I'm not sure how it works for MAC users, but it works wounderfully for XP and Vista. My only problem is that the Stylus won't read until I start up photoshop on my XP. But on a Vista, the system reconfigures perfectly for it.Wacom has better quality tablets, but the size and features on the Genius beats it hands down with the price. Any other company would sell for maybe $300+.I HIGHLY recommend getting it if you're after your starter tablet, or if you just don't have much money to spend.	positive
title: TOO DARN SAD! [SEP] content: This book is not an uplifting children's tale. It depresses me. I find the fact that the dog dies at the end (spoilers) inappropriate for children.	negative
title: BEST BOOK WRITTEN...EVER!! [SEP] content: I recived the book, and read it all in one night....Then read it over again. Del James is really one of the most TALENTED of all writers out there. His stories were done with taste and satisfaction. I hope he keeps them coming!!	positive
title: WOLVES OF THE CALLA - book 5 [SEP] content: This is a Christmas gift for my spouse. I also purchased the first four. I feel sure he would rate it 5 start, as he likes all Stephen King novels.	positive
title: You get what you pay for.... [SEP] content: I should've known that $19.99 was too little to pay for a leather planner. While the leather cover itself is nice enough, you should know that the inside is basically an inexpensive, plastic planner with cheap metal rings and pages that are not extremely functional. Every time you open up the planner, the plastic insert inside slides and moves. I'm sending it back (unfortunately with a $5 restocking fee).	negative
title: Helpful, but best to read "Miserly Moms" [SEP] content: Being an at home mom of two, I was in love with Jonni's 1st book "Miserly Moms". I was excited to read "Frugal Families" but instead was dissapointed to find that it contained much of the same information.........not my best "frugal" purchase!The content, although, would be valuable to someone that has never read her first book.....but I would suggest that they try MM instead....	negative
title: so far so good [SEP] content: Had to replace the original due to an awful noise and leakage. I had some reservations about buying a used remanufactured one but decided to give it a shot due to the price difference. My Honda's running well with no more noise or leakage. Mechanic said this was a good deal and I probably saved $50 from what he would have paid.	positive
title: Great information [SEP] content: In the beginning of the book you will find yourself laughing out loud by reading the truth, nothing but the crude truth splattered right there on your face!A little too deep into the vegetarian population makes you think twice when you are to take a bite at that delicious BBQ of yours, and really you will have a different way of thinking eating habits.A great reading full of information well written indeed, you will not be able to put the book down for a minute and will want to finish it all at once!Ciao and have fun skinny bitch!	positive
title: The Greatest.... [SEP] content: A wonderful CD which nicely showcases the talents of one of the greatest violinists ever. I loved it	positive
title: Time to Kill the "in Death" series [SEP] content: This series quickly became childish, repetitive, over priced and boring. I did enjoy seeing books of this series, including this one, in the "any book for $4" bin at a big box grocery store. I'd pass, even if they were free.	negative
title: SIMPLE!!! [SEP] content: I'll keep this short and sweet! G.I.Joe: The Rise Of Cobra is a horrible movie!!! Being a huge G.I. Joe fan since I was a kid, I was utterly disgusted with this movie! Being an open-minded critic...I fell asleep 15 mintes into this thing. It was torture! I could go on and on about why this movie is terrible...	negative
title: One of the ones that linger..... [SEP] content: There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said except that this is one of those books that make you not want to start another one. I listened to the unabridged audio version, which is read by the author. It added to the authenticity and flavor of the story and the culture.	positive
title: Enlightening [SEP] content: I have always been an advocate for overseas adoption, but after reading this story I am more inclined to encourage others to see the true story behind what goes on in other countries. It was such a blessing to read this book and I am now sharing it with others.	positive
title: Sucky [SEP] content: I got these after breaking a pair of Sharper Image noise-cancelling headphones, thinking that Sennheiser would be a good replacement, noise-cancelling or not. Not really. I used them just one day, trying them with digitally remastered music, even music mixed in *5.1 Surround Sound*, and there was just no boom from the bass, like was promised on the packaging. At a higher volume, the music is slightly more quality, but the music still lacked substance to me.There was this, and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes, and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part. For this and the above reason I am sending these things back.In all, don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think "Sennheiser = Class." I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones, but I do not know.	negative
title: Gold of the Blue Hummingbird [SEP] content: Have you ever read a book that keeps you're attention from the start and when you finish the book, you close the book and say, "Wow, that was a great book". Well that's what Gold of the Blue Hummingbird is. The author created a great possibilities book through superstition, and not only a plausible but exciting novel in the process.	positive
title: Bike for Grandson [SEP] content: I bought this bike for our grandson to use at our house. It was easy to put together and my grandson thought it was great. It is heavy (he hasn't complained though).	positive
title: perfect sery [SEP] content: i am very happy that i am able through Amazon to be able to find all these perfect tv series from 60s & 70s and one of these is of course the streets of San Francisco	positive
title: a OK tent... [SEP] content: Hoped for better...is not waterproof. Tried to make it water proof with no luck.(used 2 different sprays.) Needs a bigger rain fly. Very easy to put up and take down. The floor is the same material at walls. Dampness comes up thru floor if a plastic ground cover is not used.	negative
title: A WRINKLE IN TRUTH [SEP] content: As many writers have pointed out, the "trial by faith" aspect of this story is complete fiction. More distressing, the authors knew this and chose to perpetrate the lie anyway.However, Misty Bernall is one of the most compelling monsters in contemporary fiction. The idea of a child entrusted to her care is more chilling than any high school shooting.Madeline L'Engle did so much fine work. It is truly a shame that she would fall in with such bad company.	negative
title: really disappointed [SEP] content: this book is full of outdated and contradictory information. makes me wonder if they did any of their homework. they lump butter and margarine together and treat it as one food. on page 18 alcohol protects the brain from dementia, on page 27 it accelerates the progression of alzheimer's disease (just one of many contradictions). save your money	negative
title: Rough and tough tunes [SEP] content: Well, I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this; something along the lines of "classic Italian tunes," I believe. Well, if you're in search of something to listen to while sharing a bowl of pasta with friends, this isn't it! You'd loose your stomach! The singers are not professionals, the sound quality is very good - so you hear every straining note from the "artists." This would be a good album for an Italian language teacher, to explore dialectical differences within Italy, but beyond educational pursuits, I wouldn't reccommend this album.	negative
title: MS You Have Ruined Another Program [SEP] content: I simply cannot express my digust with Microsoft for destroying this suite of products. I upgraded to MS Office 2007 and regret wasting the money. How on earth can a corporation like this be so stupid ? All of the menus have changed- nothing is recognizable. In an instant all your experience is gone and you begin from square one. I have worked with this product since it was a DOS based product and am speechless.We should band together and help stop this insanity. Isn't there another product out there that we can go to? This is what happens when you allow a corporation to dominate an area. Let us start over with a company that has a clue. Microsoft you suck !!!	negative
title: Beginning and end of Arthurian genre. [SEP] content: I'll confess that this was the first literary piece of Arthurian Legend that I read. I was a young adult at the time. After reading this I have gone on to read a number of other versions of Arthur's world. I've taken them all at their own worth and they have contributed to my Arthurian "knowledge". However I will say that I've used T.H. White's version as the benchmark for all others. This is an incredibly well written and presented story of Arthur. And as the title of this review says. It is the beginning point of all modern Arthurian Legend coverage for me and all others are measured by it. Read The Once and Future King/Book of Merlin, learn all the names and places, timelines and events. This will give you the basis for going on to explore any/all other Arthurian works.Following this I'd recommend Mary Stewart's trilogy. But only after you read Once and Future King/Book of Merlin first.	positive
title: Slight disappointment [SEP] content: The weakest link in any booster cable is the clamps. If the connection from clamp to terminal is even slightly weak then the amperage is critically limited (even 1 ohm is too much at 12 volts). I chose these because of their fairly heavy gauge to maintain amperage despite their length, but (and you can't tell from the listing) the clamps are not as impressive as I would like -- they are the sort where there is copper on only one side of the jaws and I would prefer both. Most of us have had the experience of working clamps into corroded terminals to try to get just a bit more power. I haven't used these cables yet but assume confidently they will work fine. The cables are fairly flexible and appear sturdy and well-insulated. Don't skimp on cables, you get what you pay for, and I think these are merely a fair deal in light of their much higher price.	positive
title: Be Careful [SEP] content: I ordered this magazine last year and didn't really like it. Its basically just ads for spas. It also doesn't come every month so I kind of forgot about it before the auto renew came up. I never got a notice that the auto-renew was coming up so I didn't catch it until the magazine showed up and I got billed for it. I cancelled the subscription immediately upon receiving that first mag of the new year and asked for a refund. They sure cancelled the mag but would not refund the money I paid for the whole year subscription which was not the $5 I paid for the magazine subscription originally. So now I am out the money AND the magazine. But, honestly I do not care because about getting the magazine because I was throwing it away as soon as I got it anyway.	negative
title: Diary of a hitman [SEP] content: Stunning performances by Sherilyn Fenn and Forest Whitaker. One of those overlooked gems that you see and it never leaves your mind. That is why after so many years after a chance rental and its absence from TV showings I had to purchase it.	positive
title: An absolute disgrace [SEP] content: You know you're in trouble when the back cover reads:"This is an unofficial programme which does not seek to represent the George Harrison Estate, Apple Inc. or any other official body associated with George Harrison. This programme does not contain the music or performances of The Beatles or George Harrison."Add to that the false advertising:DVD Running Time approximately 75 minutes--> Try 57 minutes when the credits rollI'm taking my copy back to my store for a refund. It is certainly not worth the purchase price - I might buy it if it was $5.	negative
title: Not really Dozens of tactics [SEP] content: I bought this book thinking I was going to a list of tactics that were going to be innovated and creative to help me promote one of my websites. This book was really vague and didn't offer any tactics. Most of the things listed were things that you already know like "get involved in the community", "attend trade shows" or others so out of reach like "Make appearances on Talk Shows". The book also needs some revising, they a section on taking advantages of free directories like Yahoo and Yahoo's directory hasn't been free for a long time (is only free if you are a non profit).This book is not for a website owner who is trying to promote a product. Save your money and read message boards. I have gotten more ideas that way than from this book.	negative
title: "THE GRAMMYS" Deserves an AWARD [SEP] content: I really enjoy Tom O'Neil's other two books, too -- "Movie Awards" and "The Emmys." I cannot recommend these books stronger to you guys. I'm addicted to them. Get all three -- you'll thank me. (...)	positive
title: Very good story. [SEP] content: Saw this and loved it. It's a bit of a weird and quirky superman story but it feels genuine enough. The art is more realistic than normal but what ties this movie together is the development of scenes between Lex and Clark Kent. the story seems to flow quickly from one event to the next and not everything is explained. I think the story speaks for itself it's much better than the apocalypse story.	positive
title: A Christmas Carol Jim Carrey [SEP] content: What a great DVD. Jim Carrey really adds a new twist to the story and is so natural. The DVD is of good quality with great video and audio, clear and clean.	positive
title: Oldies but Goldies [SEP] content: This DVD set takes it way back! My siblings and I all recall watching this on air as kids. This was genuinely creepy stuff to the innocent youth. Brings back memories of all the other gems like "Tales from the Darkside", "Twilight Zone", "Alfred Hitchcock", "Tales from the Crypt", etc.As is often with dated sci-fi material some of the "special effects" seem corny to modern standards, yet the inferred drama & suspense techniques (plus excellent musical scores) more than make up to sustain the story line. for a classic sci-fi thriller series, providing a plethora of variety on a common theme.* Excellent packaging of this full season set (interlaced multileaf case).* Video Quality is mediocre: overall dim image with dull colors.* Nonetheless this find is a DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.If you were a fan, just get it and indulge!	positive
title: Worst Dialogue Ever [SEP] content: While a few of the reviewers have stated that they couldn't put this book down, I found it difficult to pick it up again after the first chapter. As already mentioned, the character development was weak and most of the story line was ridiculous. My main problem with this book, though, is the dialogue. For example, towards the end of the book, Becca's ex-CIA tough guy father then Adam the dashing hero both say "damnation." Not that I enjoy profanity, but it seems implausible that these types of men would use such a weak and wimpy expression to describe the extreme frustration and concern their characters would feel. The weak dialogue and poor character development used really distracted me from what could have been a fun (if implausible) story.	negative
title: Heartwarming [SEP] content: The Christmas Spurs was one of the best books I have ever read. My son picked this book as a daily reading assignment, but we both enjoyed the story. We laughed, we cried, we laughed some more and our hearts were full of joy.	positive
title: Wonderful, a classic! [SEP] content: In my opinion is the best version of Alice in Wonderland. It's wonderful and a compelling story. I watched this for the first time when I was 8 and have seen other versions both older and more recent but none of them tell the story of Alice in Wonderland like the 1985 TV movie. The entire cast is great and Natalie Gregory is the best Alice I have seen. The screenplay for this version is very philosophical, poetic and theatrical. I highly recommend it.	positive
title: Good Camcorder until "condensation" problem [SEP] content: I have had this camera for about 2 years. Worked great until about 6 months ago. When i would turn the camera on I would get a message that said "STOP CONDENSATION" it would last for a little while then the camera would work OK. As time went on, the message appeared more often and lasted longer. Now, it's hard to even use the camera, it works 1 out of every 25 times i turn it on. JVC won't respond to e-mail's and i have done everything to fix it that i have read on the internet. I cannot take it to a service center because they want $100 to just look at it and i think I can get a brand new one that hopefully will work for about $200. But you better believe it won't be a JVC.	negative
title: What a waste of writing talent [SEP] content: I just finished reading the book and thought I'd give you myopinion, whether you wanted or not. I was captivated by thebeginning, thinking that this gal writes very well. I read it to bea tongue-in-cheek novel that would be fun. After the first fewchapters, I changed my mind. The rest was painful but I readit to the end. The further I got, the more I skipped.The middle was a philosophy treatise by an amateur who tookHeisenberg's name in vain a great many times. Linking it to herown philosophical rantings.The "histories" have no place in a novel.The last part of the book, according to one of the reviewers,should have been titled, "My Boring Life Story With a Visit FromMary." It's clear why she never found a love of her life.	negative
title: this stuff works! [SEP] content: this stuff works! it eliminated "old" accidents left behind by the previous owners. Stopped my cat from adding to the mess. great product, even works on other unidentified oders too!	positive
title: dog sleeping bags [SEP] content: this was a great investment. i have two dachshunds and they sleep in this bag in my room. they love it. they have both learned how to get in it on their own and they run to my room every night and crawl in. i actually bought a second one to replace this one if it wears out. the bottom is also a leak proof nylon so if they have an accident it won't damage the carpet.	positive
title: Soooo bad [SEP] content: This book is probably the worst textbook I've used in my college career. Not only is the layout extraordinarily simple and uninteresting, but the writing is a pain to read. I found this text very stuffy and repetitive, with many sentences based on formulaic constructions as, "Implicit in our discussion of 'x', we shall introduce topic 'y,'" and "'x' delineates 'y.'"As for the content, it seemed to me to be a presentation of many theories without any supporting evidence. The authors present many psychoanalytic-like theories using hypothetical examples, but few real world examples. If you have to use this book, good luck, if not, there are much, much better texts on family psych.	negative
title: couldn't finish the book [SEP] content: I don't remember hearing this version when I was growing up. Boiling a little boy and a few other graphic wording made me shut the book before finishing. Not the visions I want to put in my little girls mind. There is enough on tv for that. I will find another Hansel and Gretel book.	negative
title: Barely watchable [SEP] content: I had heard this movie was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad. Ten minutes in they have set up this Blackwater type company that you either know will be the bad guy or is just a big ol' red herring. The best mysteries give you several red herrings, but "State of Play" makes it obvious that it will either be one thing or the other and then it just becomes boring. None of the actors are particularly bad in it including the killer who looks like Steve Carrell's cousin, but it meanders. Two stars.	negative
title: A great buy [SEP] content: My older brother had this shirt design when it first came out in the late 80's, so this is a legit vintage design on a new shirt. very cool. THRASH!	positive
title: Um...It Ends [SEP] content: Imagine traveling zillions of light years and battling murderous enemies so that you may find the meaning of life or failing that how to stop a Satanic invasion from overrunning humanity. You finally meet God, and you're so exhilirated that somehow you got to this point that you even manage to ignore that God is an idiot who tells you to have faith, and what you do is what you believe. After reading 3,500+ pages in order to reach the plot's resolution, and while the trilogy really was a waste of time I have to admire Hamilton: he wrote almost 4,000 pages of crap, managed to get it published, and managed to get a lot of readers (myself included) to read it. Is life really this boring and meaningless?	negative
title: take this junk off the punk rock listings-ether your punk or your pop-give punk rock the respect it deseves [SEP] content: why is this junk even listed under punk rock? anyone who knows what real punk rock sounds like knows that this isnt real punk rock, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker ok?	negative
title: 4 1/2 [SEP] content: This cd is good...but there's some intentional flaws that just shouldn't happen. First off, I'm sorry, but this guys vocals are terrible. He needs to do more than one cut, and even though I don't like them, put some harmonized vocals behind him, like in FAOT. However, the songs are great, besides number 1. Number 6, 8, and 10 are stand-out tracks to me. I'm not saying this is a bad cd, but I feel they kind of went backwards from FAOT. Good job though, and try to focus on the faster side.	positive
title: The biggest disappointment ever [SEP] content: This book was supposed to be so much more. I heard about its development for months at Tekken Zaibatsu (THE Tekken site for those of you who don't know), and how many of the best players in the US were putting everything they had into this book. Final result- the book has been severely rushed. Even though there's a few good things in here, and it's way better than the Prima book, there's nothing in here that experts haven't seen before. Great book for beginners though and the best overall Tekken Tag book. Get the Tekken 3 Ultimate guide instead for more in-depth strategy.	negative
title: Gorgeous!! [SEP] content: I purchased it size small, and the fit was fabulous (I'm 5'4" and 120 pounds)...you get exactly what is shown, and the exact same lenght. For me it wasn't a problem, but you could always go for some leggings if it feels better. Highly recommend it.	positive
title: Tasty, seasonal veggie recipes that are easy to make [SEP] content: The recipes my wife and I have made have been great. I like the organization by season. The "meal plans" are often too much for just the two of us. We usually just cook the entree. I'm also happy that these vegetarian meals don't rely too heavily on dairy products.The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because there isn't a photo for every dish. The photos in the book, however, are nice.	positive
title: great hook [SEP] content: I had my windows professionally cleaned then hung the hook and hummingbird feeder.Lovely to watch these spectacular birds close up.	positive
title: 3000 years from now [SEP] content: 3000 YEARS FROM NOW, THIS IS WHAT PEAPLE WILL BE LISTENING TO. I DON'T NO IN WHAT FORM MUSIC WILL BE IN AT THAT TIME,BUT I DO KNOW THE BEATLES ARE FOREVER,AND WILL BE TILL THE END OF TIME.	positive
title: I haven't read it.... [SEP] content: I haven't read this book, but I was wondering if this was the same Alissa in The Christy Miller Series?	positive
title: SEVEN ROCKS! [SEP] content: Enrique's musical influence is the 80's and nothing shows it more clearly then this latest project which is a Classic Rock album. He blends a fusion of rock and dance sounds with raw vocals to make every song completely unique. He starts out with NOT IN LOVE in which he questions whether or not he is in love. Other songs like THE WAY YOU TOUCH ME, and FREE are anthems to passion and sex, especially FREE which is graphically explicit. BE YOURSELF is a lesson in not letting others destroy your dreams and goals in life. WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME and SAY IT are about losing a loved one; YOU ROCK ME, ROAMER and LIVE IT UP TONIGHT are pure upbeat rock songs, especially YOU ROCK ME which has a strong sexual theme to it. All in all he captures the classic 80's sound and gives it a new twist. For those of you who miss 80's rock (the best decade of American music) this album is for you!	positive
title: Great reference book [SEP] content: Awesome reference book! You can easily find everything you want. There are a lot of special case of using one or another word. All examples are written by very clear language.	positive
title: back off lindsay dang [SEP] content: ok im not gonna say that this is the best pop cd ever but dang everyone is saying shes ripin off ashley( who is one of her best friends) or hillary or britney ok so is every song they sing a rip off of the girls from the 80s who came out b4 them no.. just cause someone came out first doesnt mean everyone else is tryin to be them she wrote allmost all these songs and did a great job at it... so just back off allready i mean if u dont like her to begin with why in the world would u buy her cd then trash her?	positive
title: Finally the Evidence! [SEP] content: The fact that Santorum could get a mean spirited and medeival book like published is proof that there could be no such thing as Intelligent Design!	negative
title: Change is not always for the best [SEP] content: Although the illustrations are good, this will not appeal to everyone. I was always a bit uncomfortable reading aloud a few of the traditional verses -- "she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed" -- is an especially alarming example. But adults don't always give children enough credit; many generations have mentally sorted through these verses with no lasting harm. The rhythm, cadence and whimsy of the original versions have been sacrificed to be replaced with clumsy morals and motivational messages.	negative
title: WAS BUGSY GOOD? [SEP] content: BUGSY MALONE...I LOVED THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A KID,AND I GOT TO FINALY SEE IT AGAIN.THE PIC WAS VERY CLEAR...AND IT ARRIVED FAST.I DO RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT AND THE SELLER.	positive
title: Hold your nose [SEP] content: Be forewarned - I DESPISE Hillary Clinton. We know irrefutably she has zero caring or compassion, and places herself above the laws of god and man. She wishes to impose on the American people a socialist and mundane existence that she herself would never even consider (ask William Dale if you do not believe she is a destroyer of lives).Having said that, I held my nose and read. Much like Hillary, the book is shallow and empty. There's nothing here, and anything that could potentially stand on its own as a point of interest is most likely untrue. And, of course, she didn't write it.	negative
title: Two radio song and that is it [SEP] content: I was really dissapointed by this album. I read all this hype and accliam... Then I bring it home and start listening and boom sounds like House of Pain. I was suckered into thinking Everlast had a new style, but it is still as bad as it was years ago. I must admit Ends and What its Like were superb. Even after listening to the slbum a few times hoping something would grow on me there was no luck. I am sorry though it has a break through song this album is not worth the time or money.	negative
title: Yummy tunes [SEP] content: I am a longtime fan of Patrick O'Hearn and have been listening to his music since his very early days of "New Age" music. It is becuase of him, and musicians like him that I have been a long term "ambient" music fan.Mr. O'Hearn does not disappoint with this CD. I first heard "So Flows the Current" while listening to Lights Out (Kink FM in Portland) and fell in love with it's haunting melody. While the other songs are each different in mood, I love them all. I think the songs chosen peacefully coexist on this album, and that's important to me. This CD is also one that most of my massage clients inquire about. If you like Mark Isham I think you'll like this music too. Relaxing, floaty, with a touch of poignant feeling.	positive
title: A sweet story with a moral [SEP] content: A young girl's compassion for an abused pony becomes an allegory for her relationship with the neighbor bully. It's a very readable tale, with enough detail to build the characters' personalities and paint a realistic setting. Young readers will be able to identify with Niki and her struggle to see the value in a "lost cause" and act on her convictions.	positive
title: Wired incorrectly [SEP] content: Could not get this to work with my portable DVD player. Pulled the 3.5mm plug out slightly and the audio worked. I assumed that some wires within the cable were incorrectly connected or reversed. 3.5mm plug has 4 contact points, which makes sense as the inputs are video, L-audio, R-audio and common ground. Tried another identical RCA A/V to 3.5mm cable and it worked fine. Good thing I only paid $2.50 for this piece of garbage.	negative
title: A very ordinary effort [SEP] content: This book does not take you through quantum computing in any logical way. The author does not explain where he is going with his lengthy examples in each section. Instead he tends to launch into hard to follow, artificially concocted examples with little rationale and then move to the next topic without a conclusion or a reason for why he put the reader through such boring experience. The discussion of the Bohr - Einstein debate told me nothing of what the debate was about and there are many references to the EPR without any real explanation of what was in it. There must be a better way to understand this subject else I will have to conclude that Einstein was right and God really does play dice. Give this book a miss... it is simply not worth the effort. Even my one star is generous.	negative
title: Love the series but discs will not play [SEP] content: The problem is that discs 5 and 6 of season 4 would not play. I tried the discs in two different players with no success. A total of 6 episodes were unwatchable. I purchased these about 6 months before I played them and it was past the return window when I discovered the problems. I would only want to be able to replace Season 4 Discs 5 and 6. Can someone help me out here?	negative
title: Great cd, but would serve better with a 2 cd set [SEP] content: Ronnie Milsap's late '60's recordings for Scepter Records were some of his greatest performances. Too bad no one has released a truly complete cd set featuring all the great r & b songs he did for Scepter. This cd features a good number of his best, but omits plenty of good tunes....like his version of Spinning Wheel, which cuts out the excess that Blood, Sweat and Tears implemented in their version....others like "Ain't No Soul Left in These Old Shoes", "Old Man at the Fair", "Win My Love and Break My Heart", "I Saw Pity in the Face of a Friend", "I Can't Stop Crying" (one of his very best!), and "Another Branch From the Old Tree" could all be included if they would reissue all the songs in a 2-cd collection. I have all these songs on LP and they are great, but sometimes sound scratchy from surface noise. Hopefully they get around to releasing them in a reissue.	positive
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: This book and francisco Goldman are highly regarded. He uses magic realism to trace history intertwined with two girls lives. It does not work for me as it seems only an aaccumulation of details and pontification.	negative
title: GREAT MIXER! [SEP] content: THIS WAS A WEDDING GIFT. I ALREADY OWN A KITCHENAID MIXER AND LOVE IT. I AM SURE SHE WILL TOO. VERY DEPENDABLE PRODUCT & MADE WELL.	positive
title: Last order you will rec from me???? [SEP] content: I will never order from you again.Very poor service.You ripped me off over charge me.did not send what i order .check you so called A-TO-Z And you will see what I'M talking about.And Close my Account(NOW) I'll never buy from you again.And I'M going to let all my friends no how you ripped me off.Allan	negative
title: Wolfgang Puck Grill / Griddle [SEP] content: Friends of ours in Texas bought this item a year ago. We visited them in October and were impressed with the convenience of frying eggs for 6 or 8 people at once. We purchased the same item for Christmas and have been delighted with the results.	positive
title: Gangbuster: How a street tough, Elite Homicide Took Down New [SEP] content: I once live on Beekman but moved before all the Redtop Yellow top saga really got moving, reading this book let me see what my brother and his kids lived through, Mr. Stone really captured the gang and there doings well	positive
title: Seriously spooky [SEP] content: This would make a great CD for Halloween. The combination of Steven Roach's creepy atmospherics,and Hudson's talent on the didgeridoo make for one spooky recording.Native Australians speak of the Dream Time Well,this is nightmare time!	positive
title: Hall, Desmond, Baker = awesome. [SEP] content: This is a great album. Chet Baker is really good and with his reputation for excessive behavior it is more remarkable. Chet is on his game as is Desmond. Jim Hall is good as expected, but it is the ensemble work with the 2 horn players that makes this exceptional. I like this album much more than Bill Evans' Interplay which is also an ensemble album with Jim Hall. Stereophile magazine has used this album to test speakers and I understand why. It is well recorded and has fine performances. I recommend higly for any fan of Paul Desmond who would like to hear Paul in a group other than the Brubeck quartet. That being said, this is a Jim Hall feature and he is also in great but understated form.	positive
title: An awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: "The Golden Compass" is a very jocular, adverturous, interesting and great fantasy book. It wraps you up in its story and keeps you there till the last page is turned. I myself could not put it down and it was the same for "The Subtle Knife". I love these books and I am waiting for the last book so I can find out what happens to Lyra.	positive
title: Miss....and, Hit? (2.5 stars) [SEP] content: Right out of the bottle, all i smell is BLACK PEPPER. I swear. Might as well go to your kitchen and pop open your basic jar of ground pepper because that's what it smells like. I actually regretted buying it at first. HOWEVER, once it dries, it actually smells quite pleasant. But the overall scent gets VERY faint, so I'm thinking it's not going to last more than a couple hours. You'd have to spray quite a bit on you. I only did one spray because the initial scent is SO overpowering. I guess I'll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after. Overall, it's ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit, that one is amazing. If you're into fresh or citrusy scents, this one's not for you. TRY before you buy, i can't stress that enough with Burberry London.	negative
title: awful [SEP] content: I rarely write reviews, but this screen protector is awful! I read all of the instructions and I have applied plenty of screen protectors onto my phone, so I know it doesn't take more than a minute to apply flawlessly. After thoroughly cleaning the screen, I applied it carefully to the screen. I noticed some bubbles, so I used the enclosed card to squeeze them out. I even tried using the skotch tape trick as illustrated in the instructions. The enclosed card scratched the screen and now I have more bubbles than ever. It looks really cheap and scratched and the words on my kindle are extra blurry. It is anti glare and anti fingerprint as promised, but I would trade all of those options for a clear invisible screen protector, even if my fingerprints are all over it.	negative
title: Not Received Yet [SEP] content: I have not received this book yet. I don't know why......Why did I have to rate this item with one star in order to send this review. That star in #2 is invalid.	negative
title: Yes!!!!! [SEP] content: These sisters can sing!!!! I remember this CD from waay back when... production, vocals, songwriting... it's something else.... wish there was a follow-up to this CD..... Awesome!!!! Hard to find.... but so worth the effort.	positive
title: Moving story and a near perfect use of language [SEP] content: I don't know what I enjoyed more, the actual story of these fascinating characters, or the sheer beauty of the language. I quickly came to know and care about all the people here: Frank, whose dwarfism makes him ugly in his own and others' eyes; Bernadette, his mother; and all the others who revolve around them like planets around the stars.Perhaps it does getsa bit too philosophical at times, and probably should have been about 50-100 pages shorter to avoid the continued reiteration of the theme, but when the writing is so alluring, how can I carp about length?	positive
title: Good Clock [SEP] content: I have bad eyes and needed a clock with big numbers. This clock works fine. The numbers can easily be seen across the room. The description states the numbers are green, but they are more of a avacado green, almost yellow. But that works for me, makes the numbers very visible. The dimensions of the face of the clock are 7 3/4" across by 3 1/4" tall. The numbers themselves are 2" tall by 1" wide. There is a hi/low dimmer for the lights. My only complaint is that its not as loud as I would like. I like my clocks really loud, so I don't miss school. I would rate this clock as being medium in loudness. Which is okay because some people prefer a less intense alarm. I haven't missed school, yet. The durability is the same as any other clock in this price range. Overall, I'm happy.	positive
title: Bad Intuit, Bad Bad Intuit [SEP] content: Never had much problem with with product activation. But the unaccounced installation and continued operation of the CDAC11BA program is enough for me - Intuit's Quicken and TurboTax are out!	negative
title: The Mystery Goes On [SEP] content: I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery. I guess it proves the adage about winning one "For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type"	negative
title: Great for sleeping, but these birds don't fly. [SEP] content: I loved this toy for our baby girl. The music is precious and she really enjoyed watching the little birds move. After several months, the only thing that works is the light and music. It no longer moves even after changing batteries. I've found this with the fish toy as well. Love the music, but not life of the toy.	negative
title: Happiness is a Warm Blanket [SEP] content: I normally love everything relating to the Peanuts comic strip as well as the various animated productions that have been presented. This DVD was simply gross disappointment......RWS	negative
title: Duplication warning [SEP] content: There is a substantial duplication of titles on this DVD in the Three Disc Set "The Christmas Collection", with some but not very many differences. If you've already ordered the Christmas Collection, this DVD is pretty much reinventing the Wheel	negative
title: What a wonderful artist [SEP] content: Michael Card is one of my most favorite artists. His songs are so in tune with God and the scriptures and just relays that he is such a godly person. This album features most of his older music which is wonderful, it will always be my favorite music. Songs like God's Own Fool, El Shaddai, Known By the Scars and Joseph's song are just examples of what a great songwriter, singer and person Michael Card. I highly recommend this album before others (beside his first two, First Light and Legacy)because you will love his music from the start if you are into "deep" songs.	positive
title: wicked comfy! [SEP] content: This chair is kind of criminally comfortable. I don't think i have ever sat in anything so comfortable. Only problem for me was that it was too short- and I am only 5'8". If I was an inch or two shorter, I don't think the footrest bar would be irritating at all. However, if you're my height or above, go with the XL version so you don't have a bar digging into your ankles!	positive
title: Great While It Lasted [SEP] content: I loved this product for the first 30 days I had it. It worked well and was nice and compact - no wires dangling all over my car. Then all of the sudden, it has lost its broadcasting strength. I have to hold it right next to the radio (on any frequencey I try) and even then, can barely hear it through all the static.	negative
title: Finally! [SEP] content: As Mr. Huddleston said, this is a truly unique collection of progressive rock songs from the top artists of the genre in the 70's. I have been looking for this for quite a while, and of course, find it in the most obvious place! Great stuff	positive
title: The Road to El Dorado dvd [SEP] content: This is a very fun dvd. A fun way to tell El Dorado story. Great music and art. You and your family will like this movie.	positive
title: A bad brew [SEP] content: This coffee maker is to be avoided; it makes an evil-tasting and smelling, chemical/metalic tinted brew. It was taste-tested compared with our 20 year old Krups maker of the same size, using the same water, coffee, grind and filter brand. We tried 3 pots but they all turned out the same---bad, undrinkable.Cuisinart DCC-450BK 4-Cup Coffeemaker with Stainless-Steel Carafe, BlackChevy Chase	negative
title: Remastered [SEP] content: The songs - Smiling Faces, Papa was a Rolling Stone, & Ball of Confusion, soundedvery foreign to me. I took a second look at the cd cover & noticed it said Remastered. I was looking for the original sound of the songs, as they were played on the radio in 1971. If you dont mind the remastering, and you just love the words I guess you would like this cd. But if your looking for the original sound as played on the radio, this will not please you.	negative
title: A few seconds [SEP] content: This CD is almost totally a waste of Cherry's time and energy. Those of us who bought it as Cherry fans when it first came out called it "Disco Don" and gave it away or sold it (cheap). This is standard funk jazz, faceless and hysterically excited about nothing. The biggest shame here is that an otherwise unrecorded Cherry composition, which begins wistfully with Collin Walcott's sitar, a piece that in concert was brilliantly played by Cherry on piano and trumpet, is hereby immortalized as yet another piece of fusion tripe. A reviewer a little ways up the ladder here says Relativity Suite should be reissued, and when that happy day comes may Disco Don also vanish without a trace---except for those few seconds....	negative
title: Good product [SEP] content: This feeder is a good product and much better than the feeders that I have tried in other brands. The motor is quiet and the construction is durable. It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy. However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away. I would recommend this feeder to anyone.	positive
title: Ripping naval fiction in the 1700s British Navy [SEP] content: This is the second installment of the "Richard Bolitho" series, about a fictional British naval officer during the 1700s. In this novel Bolitho is newly promoted to Lieutenant. The ship to which he is assigned has a secret mission involving intrigue and treasure (no spoilers here). The best aspect of this novel is the continued maturation and development of Lieutenant Bolitho. There is plenty of action in this novel, and it is an excellent read.My favorite aspect of the "Bolitho" novels are the parts that deal with the American Revolution. This second Bolitho novel does not deal with that topic much. No matter; it is still an engrossing novel. Recommended. RJB.	positive
title: Broken hardware (brass bolt) included [SEP] content: I tried to assemble this glider chair, however one of the 6 small bolts included for assembly was broken. The end of the bolt (where the allen wrench fits) was not punched correctly at the factory, and therefore the allen wrench will not seat into the bolt head. Totally frustrating. I contacted Amazon to try to get just a replacement bolt but they said I have to return the whole chair, which I have already mostly assembled and would have to spend 30 minutes taking apart and packing up again. Just for a bolt. Totally frustrating, and too much inconvenience to return this bulky item. I will just buy a replacement bolt next time I go to the hardware store.	negative
title: Side effects [SEP] content: After 7-10 days, I suffered an adverse side effect, which abated after I discontinued use.	negative
title: Too Long [SEP] content: Since I was a child, people have been talking about this book. It seems to be talked about on the news and just in general conversation. I have to be honest. I am lazy and this book is just TOO LONG. I don't have time to read a book that is over 1000 pages. And this book is sneaky. It doesn't seem like it's so long, but the writing is on these pages that are as thin as t***** paper (the paper you use to wipe feces). I am sure this is probably an okay book, but I just don't have the time to read this whole thing.	negative
title: Unsafe; walls too low [SEP] content: My 2-year-old flipped out of this right away. We took it down after 1 hour. Our 1-year-old almost flipped out too and probably would have, if I kept it up. The walls are simply too low for this to be safe. Flipping out of it, my son snapped his neck. He was fine, but I was worried about what could have happened. Also, the two children crashed into one another all the time, hurting one another. Mainly due to wall height, this is an unsafe product. Sure, it was plenty fun for them. It's too bad it did not work out.Another thing to note is that there is a strong vinyl smell (which is supposed to be toxic, right)? In addition, the product is very large and didn't really fit anywhere without taking up a whole room. It takes a long time to inflate with an electric pump, so once it's up, it's up. Do not buy.	negative
title: What is this film about? [SEP] content: A guy in a fright mask apparently thinks that he is Jesus,or maybe Lucifer,or maybe both at the same time...He talks to angels,or are they demons?He crucifys some girls in the woods,or does he?The dialouge for this film is mainly religious-inspired gibberish...When the lunatic main charecter is not talking to himself,or to the demons/angels,or to a potential victim there are some VERY bad rock songs played...The blurb on the dvd box says something about an LSD trip gone bad,and about not letting yourself be tied up,but there is no evidence that anyone let themselves be tied up,and maybe the film-maker was actually on LSD when he made this film..in any event the film is incoherent...	negative
title: Another Great Season! [SEP] content: This show is hysterical, however, the humor is esoteric. I own the other season, and will buy the 3rd as soon as it comes out.	positive
title: Evolving?? [SEP] content: If the word evolving means that you simplify song structures and lyrics and make it more dull and lame then this band is really good at that. How can you say this band is evolving ? Yes it is album that is more easy to listen to when washing the dishes or just hanging around with friends drinking beer, but even so becomes boring. I have a feeling that Dredg has one of the biggest amount of fanboys ever. What they say is totaly irrelevant. I have NEVER wanted this new album to be like El cielo. And i really doubt that other dissapointed reviewers too wanted another El cielo. It is just soulless guys.	negative
title: Feel Guilty Giving This Away [SEP] content: I used this shoe rack for a few weeks before I decided it wasn't worth the hassle. The rods regularly slipped out, the shoes kept sliding off, and the shelf continually needed straightening. It's now sitting in a moldy hamper in my basement because I can't decide if I want to donate this junk or throw it away -- painful given how much I spent on it, and wasteful to boot!	negative
title: Got one for yourself [SEP] content: I love a package of selling three stylus. Arrived in a timely manner and acceptable price. It works fine and just like as what describes.	positive
title: Not my usual genre [SEP] content: This isn't my usual genre, but it's hard to put this book into a genre. It has elements of sci-fi, paranormal, adventure and a little romance.What I like best about the book is the writing. This gal has talent. Well done, tight and concise in character development, dialogue, and action.What I didn't like is the fact that this book doesn't end, it's not a stand alone, but a continuation that lasts for 5 books. Having said that, I'll still continue the series because I thoroughly enjoyed it.	positive
title: All Books Should Be Written This Way ... Except ... [SEP] content: For me, if I wrote a book, I'd want it to have all of the production values of this book.The layout gets an "A".I like the chapter sections with a `binding of content' in the quotations used and the graphics employed.This is a beautifully compiled book.Three problems. Content, content, content.I also have books on bookbinding, the art of making your own books. This book will move from my technical bookshelf to my "Arts in creative bookbinding" shelf.This is truly a beautiful book. What I'll learn regarding the GoLive 6 application will be minimal but what I've gained on modern layout is outstanding.I'm sure the editor of this book an I are best friends.	negative
title: The Absolute Worst of the Solo Efforts [SEP] content: This album just plain stinks! It is the product of a pompous, egotistical megalomaniac. Oh, and look at the all-star cast: Cher, Helen Reddy, Liza Minelli, just to name a few. This album reeks of blantant shameless commercialism. "See You in Your Dreams" is a great song off of the "Rock-n-Roll Over" album. It was remade on this album and absolutely ruined. To make matters worse, it then fades into "When You Wish Upon a Star." "Tunnel of Love" and "Livin' in Sin" are examples of Gene's overwhelming obsession with sex and with his narcisistic self. The only cut that has any alleged redeeming qualities is "Radioactive." This song translated very well into the Dynasty Tour's live set. Still, that doesn't change the fact that this album is just plain lousy. It's only value is as a collector's item. Any sane person would be embarassed to be caught listening to it.	negative
title: DISAPPOINTING [SEP] content: the containers were too difficult to open. the amount of space was what i needed but we wont be using it daily as hoped.	negative
title: would not recommend for everyday Rice Eaters [SEP] content: This is not the best rice cooker I've ever owned. It makes the rice hard after about 5 hours. I would have to turn it off after that time. Such a hassle to have to reheat rice at your next meal.The color, look, and price is Awesome. But not worth for Everyday Rice Eaters to purchase.	negative
title: Sick "Not-even-funny" Comedy [SEP] content: I have been a big fan of Russell Peters for past few years. I was eagerly waiting for this DVD and bought it the day it came out. I am completely disappointing with it. Jokes are nothing but sick. He said some terrible things even though there was a kid in the audience. At one point, Russell even said that and his mother (I hope he was kidding on this) was also in the audience, which is even more terrible. He said repeatedly that he has a lot of money. I do not understand how that is funny or relevant to his comedy? Complete waste of time. Do check some snippets of the video to see if you like it before you buy it. My recommendation: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Just buy this one if you haven't seen itComedy Now! Starring Russell Peters--something that (for some weird reason--oh yeah money, I thought he had a lot of it) he does not endorse.	negative
title: On the whole, very poor! [SEP] content: The book is padded from cover to cover with a dump of the API text file! No body in their right mind would type a long API declaration when they can copy it from the API viewer. Hundreds of pages wasted just to make it look like a computer book (2.5 inches). What there is left is very poorly documented and the examples are useless from a learning standpoint. I suspect the 5 star rating by another reader was one of the books authors using a Hotmail account ...	negative
title: If You Haven't Seen The Movie And You Don't Want To Know What Happens Then Don't Read This [SEP] content: Carrie is considered a horror movie. Well, personally, I didn't find it all that scary and I'm only twelve. From the beginning scene in the shower room (they're so mean!)until the crowning of the prom King and Queen, you keep wondering (or at least i did) what is going to set Carrie off, because all of these people are really mean to her, including her mother, and she still doesn't do anything really bad with her power of telekinesis. The dumping of the pig's blood kind of creeped me out. I mean, that's just wrong. The only parts that I found creepy were Carrie's eyes during the evil part of the gym scene, and the part where all the knives fly into her mother. The very end would have made me jump a foot if I hadn't seen that part once before on T.V. The acting was amazing, particularly by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. This is a very good, suspenseful movie.	positive
title: Is there a movie in this DVD? [SEP] content: After inserting this DVD in the DVD player, I got a (pretty long) advertisement for some movie... and then another one... and then another one...I tried to get to the main menu, but the DVD won't allow it, if you want to see this movie, then you HAVE to go through who knows how many "previews" of other movies. You cannot fast forward, or skip them.Is the movie "Dos tipos de cuidado" really in this DVD? I don't know, I did not have the patience to wait and find out. After an incredible long time of going through movie previews, I took the DVD and trashed it.Avoid this DVD, it is just a collection of movie previews, and you are FORCED to watch them if you (unlike me) have the patience to wait until the movie that you paid to watch actually shows.	negative
title: Great Songs, Too Much Foo Foo [SEP] content: All the Wee Sing products teach songs I learned as a child that I enjoy passing on to my children. My youngest has Down Syndrome and is 16 now. He has earned money to collect all nine Wee Sing DVD's and enjoys them a lot. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is his current favorite but he doesn't communicate well enough for me to know why he likes it. In my opinion, too much time is given to the Little Bunny Foo Foo story woven between the songs. The story was fine; it just took up too much time-- we could have had more great songs! The video downplays the glories of all the good things to eat in the Big Rock Candy Mountain, which is nice for parents but takes away some of the magic the name of the video promises. All of the Wee Sing videos do moralize but others do it less obtrusively. Under the Sea is the worst, Marvelous Musical Mansion is best in this regard.	positive
title: Knowledge about my body! [SEP] content: This book is easy to read, full of useful information and has empowered me! I am more than pleased with my purchase.	positive
title: At long last... [SEP] content: I have been an avid Utada Hikaru fan from the moment I first heard "First Love," and from then on, she has never ceased to amaze me with her music.EXODUS is absolutely no exception.With witty lyrics set to incredibly catchy tunes, EXODUS properly reveals to an US audience the undeniably talented force that is Utada Hikaru. Listening to the songs like "The Workout," "Devil Inside," "Easy Breezy," and "Let Me Give You My Love" you really get a sense of her growth not only as an adult, but as a musical artist as well. It's an addictive album and no fan collection will be complete without it.	positive
title: All in all this movie is a bit of Sci-Fi/Comedy Awesome! [SEP] content: I watched this thinking it was another spoofy comedy with Vince, Ben, and Jonah.It wasn't.It was a bit silly as they created the neighborhood watch, but then the sci-fi part of the film kicked in and WOW I was loving it. As good a movie as I've seen in a while, but very hard to compare with other works. It is more serious than Mars Attacks, Galaxy Quest, or Paul, but not as serious as Pitch Black, Alien, or Predator. If you liked 4 of the six movies I just named then you'll definitely like "The Watch."All in all this movie is a bit of Sci-Fi/Comedy Awesome! 4 stars - M.R.	positive
title: This Blender is at the Top of My "Wish List" [SEP] content: Lots of power in this "sci-fi" style blender with a modern appearance out of the "X-files". The black and stainless steele color combination will update any decor. Cuisinart makes a first quality product and this one is definitely built to last. The seven speeds provide maximum versatility for the most serious of cooks (or for those of us who like to make our lives in the kitchen simplier and easier!) This product is at the top of my "wish-list". It makes many formerly tedious jobs a breeze. Make your own milkshakes and (preservative-free)baby food. Crushes ice too, which is an unexpected bonus from a blender now that summer's around the corner.	positive
title: Not made like it used to be [SEP] content: We were so excited to find this item because I had been searching for ages to replace the one we had used for years and years manufactured under another name but the cutting blade showed signs of stress and cracking during the first day of use.	negative
title: Propet Flex Walker [SEP] content: Very comfortable. I wear them for walking and working out at the local women's gym. I do recommend them.	positive
title: CAUTION!! This is just 3D pictures, its not a movie [SEP] content: I expected this to be a movie, or a compilation of movie clips from WWII. It is not, even though its listed as a movie it it just a flipbook of 3D photos.I paid $9.99 and feel I was ripped off. You definitely shouldn't be paying any more than that!	negative
title: works great [SEP] content: I clean homes for a living and this is a gem of a product.Handle lifts and places without any trouble and is easy to store in the trunk of my car.Pads come off easily and all you have to do is wash (without any fabric softener)and let air dry.Works on all floor types including wood,linoleum and tile.Plus you can dry mop if you like to.	positive
title: Oregon 511A [SEP] content: Other than poor assembly instructions,that everyone else has pointed out, it is a great tool. My only suggestion to improve it would be to make the angle settings ratcket so you could be assured that you have it exactly on the degree mark you desire.	positive
title: Volleyball Fundamentals (Sports Fundamentals Series) [SEP] content: Excellent for a beginning coach to review skills. Good drills.	positive
title: NOT Compatible with Cingular 8525 [SEP] content: I bought this package to use with my Cingular 8525. It did nothing! These items are NOT compatible.	negative
title: Not really as good as MKDS or DKRDS! [SEP] content: I purchased this game for my niece since she is a huge fan of Power Puff Girls! We played this game once and were really disappointed. Why? Simply put, every single thing in it sucks like hell, from graphic, game play, music, replay value, etc. Worst of all, however, is that this game doesn't have Wi-Fi! We rather play MKDS or DKRDS! Do not buy this game. You might regret you did! I sure did at least.	negative
title: Asset protection for dummies [SEP] content: You will learn some things upfront and save yourself some heartache and moneyprior to going to an attorney. Everyone should know ideas on how to protect themselves.	positive
title: good solid groove album! [SEP] content: I think a couple of these reviews are rather harsh, this really isn't a bad cd at all! Lenny and Victor have a nice groove going throughout, not too much showboating (they've matured in 20 or so years folks!) Larry plays some nice jagged, atonal lines and sounds like he is enjoying himself. I almost passed on this from the reviews, I'm glad I didn't! A live show of this might be really fun!	positive
title: Perfect for 8-14 year olds [SEP] content: Perfect balance of information, accessibility, and approachability. It's not a ponderous tome, so kids arent intimidated by it. There are lots of color pictures and examples. The definitions do not cover ALL forms of the word, but so far everything my son has looked up was exactly the definition he was looking for. He sometimes just sits and reads this dictionary!	positive
title: forget it [SEP] content: I got put in jail for 30 days for having this on my bike, it's illegal in most states. Might be good for kids around the block for anyone who rides in the city, forget it.	negative
title: Kit Heater A-Ok [SEP] content: Kit was great, had all the parts I needed to install my heater. Just a little disappointed in the flexible piping, thought it would be longer.	positive
title: Not worth it ! [SEP] content: this movie is not what it was cracked up tone, Channing Tatum was cute, shallow story line. Not much else!glad I rented it , not purchased .	negative
title: I like but my son does not [SEP] content: I liked this CD very much and sang to the songs myself since a lot of them were ones that I enjoyed as a child. But my song preferd my other CDs which I listen to on a normal basis. I bought this and #1 for my car so we could enjoy it while we drove a long distance to my parents house but he didnt show any interest. Maybe over time he will learn to enjoy??	positive
title: Eagerly anticipated- utterly disappointed [SEP] content: I have always been a big fan of Jonathan Winters, and it was with some excitement that I ordered this book. Unfortunately , it was one of the few I have ever thrown away. The "stories", as such, are not much more than idle and disconnected ramblings and often if a selection does contain anything to link it, the ending is nonsensical and unsatisfying. The "humor" in the book would only appeal to someone who found illogic a source of mirth. I'm sure if this book had been submitted for sale by an unknown author, it would have gone quickly to the place publishers call the "slush pile."Don't waste your money on it.	negative
title: Terrible! [SEP] content: This charm is a total waste of money! The words are so small you can't even read them. Worst italian charm I ever bought! (and I've bought many!)	negative
title: Total Disgust [SEP] content: I found the quality of the product to be far below average. I have been completely unable to play the puzzles because when it opens I was unable to activate the puzzles. The sound track repeated the thumps over and over and my cursor was frozen. I went through the entire Troubleshooting process to no avail. I feel I wasted my money. I have found to be unsatisfactory.	negative
title: Gas grill is on vacation, electric smoker is in the trash [SEP] content: I love this grill.We now do 90% of our grilling on the Traeger. The gas grill is still good for burgers and steaks, but everything else goes on the pellet grill. So far we have tried tri-tip, pulled pork, whole chicken, chicken legs/thighs/breasts, turkey, fish, sausage, and ribs. Next up is beef brisket.This is bar none the best way to cook a tri-tip or chicken. Prepare/marinate your meat as you normally would and then cook it on high. Since the pellet grill cooks with indirect heat, flare-ups and hot spots are not a problem. You can cook tri-tip in half the time as usual.For slow cook meats just make sure you have plenty of pellets in the hopper. Prepare your meat, toss it on, and come back in several hours when it is perfectly done.Everyone I have had over that has seen the grill and eaten the food it has cooked now wants one.I would definately buy this product again.	positive
title: Horrible sounding headphones [SEP] content: This is the first time I have ever bought a product on Amazon and returned it back to them because the product was so bad.After I received the headphones in the mail, I plugged them into my iPod and was very disappointed to hear how TERRIBLE they sounded. There was NO bass at all! I am certainly not a person to be picky about sound quality. I'm not the type of person to spend tons of money on headphones and speakers; I will usually just pick out the least expensive ones and that will suit me fine. However, these were just plain horrible!I do not understand why there are so many good reviews for these headphones on here. In my opinion, they were one of the worst sounding earphones I have ever tried. I couldn't even listen to one song before I decided to send them back and get a refund. Don't waste your money.	negative
title: Exciting Tale [SEP] content: I originally wanted to read the Last of the Mohicans because of the very enjoyable movie but I picked up this book and chose to read it first. I do not regret my decision. I was unaware when I began reading this book in the Leatherstocking series that it was not the first book in the series. A reader who has not read other books in the series can feel confident that they won't feel lost if they start reading this book. The book portrays very detailed images of the forests, lakes, rivers, and people of the French and Indian War time period during the 18th century. The character development and plot are very well done. The book also gives a glimpse of the harsh realities of war during this time period. The writing style of the book is also fascinating and reminds me, at times, of epic poetry. I highly recommend it.	positive
title: Good file from Amazon [SEP] content: Excellent. I should have spent the money for a good American made file a long time ago. Now I am spoiled. When I ordered it I did not think there would be that much difference.	positive
title: Severely Disappointed [SEP] content: My puppy has a chewing problem, as do many, and so when I bought this product I was relieved that I'd finally found something to get her to stop chewing on the furniture. But not only didn't it stop her from doing so...but she was *attracted* to the gel.	negative
title: Eights 's Greats [SEP] content: I first heard this band play live in Ft. Lauderdale in, of course, 1988. THIS IS/WAS A GREAT BAND!!! I immediately bought their "double" live CD at the show (don't know if that live CD is still available). Their show that night was just as good as their live CD which was REALLY excellent. The Crazy Eights are one of my all time favorite live bands and I've seen some great ones:Happy The ManGenesisYesMahavishnu Orchestra w/ John McLaughlinWeather ReportGentle Giant, etc.The Eight's are definitely up there in my book! Thanks guys for some truly great music.	positive
title: this shouldn't even be on amazon [SEP] content: there is alot of other good stuff,remixes & the lot on amazon. Darn, I think I even previewed it.	negative
title: Girl Power!!! [SEP] content: Finally, a Disney leading woman who's NOT a damsel in distress!!! Mulan is a warrior woman who uses both her brains and her brawn!!! And she chooses her life first over a guy!!! She is driven by honor and NOT by love or lust!!! It's about time Disney gets up to date on women's issues!!!	positive
title: What Happened? [SEP] content: What have they done to Zip Wax? It doesn't work anymore. It used to be the best wax on the market, they must have changed the ingredients. I've used this for years and it worked beautifully, now it's pretty useless!	negative
title: Good idea [SEP] content: I am not a mother, but am a vet student and use this thermometer to get fast, accurate rectal temperatures on cats and dogs. I imagine that a mad cat and a baby would equally apprecaite this product. I have double checked the readings I get against the standard ones our hospital uses and the readings have been within 0.1 degrees; so I consider it pretty accurate.	positive
title: Will not stay standing up right [SEP] content: Pole that you put paper towel on wobbles, can't tighten leans to the side I have tried to fix and its hopeless I am very disappointed. Would not recommend!	negative
title: Wonderful [SEP] content: This is among my most favorite collections of music I have ever owned. I can't say enough good things about it, everything about it is simply beautiful. If you enjoy this type of music, this CD has a wonderful variety of sounds, melodies and moods.	positive
title: Love this product! [SEP] content: Bought this for my little baby, who seems to like it much. Very good quality material. Can't recommend this nipple enough.	positive
title: Don't expect much from the b-sides. [SEP] content: "There There" is a very good song. However, since it's also on Radiohead's latest album, Hail To The Thief, there's absolutely no reason to buy this single unless you're a completist like myself."Paperbag Writer" (is that title supposed to be a joke?) is a typical Radiohead b-side (a lot like the stuff they put on their albums except not as grandiose), though quite a bit below par compared to the b-sides from Amnesiac's singles. "Where Bluebirds Fly" begins, ends, and runs throughout with THE most irritating percussion loop I've ever heard. The echoey, ghostly vocals have also become a bit much by this point. It's obvious that they didn't put a lot of effort into these songs, and that worries me since this is the lead-off single for the album. Hopefully, future singles' b-sides will be a lot better, but I'm not holding my breath.	negative
title: A Movie [SEP] content: This is one time where the movie will likely be better than the book...a real Indiana Jones type story	negative
title: VERY POOR QUALITY DVD!!! [SEP] content: I loved this 60's italian film, but... in my opinion, in this DVD the image's quality is very very poor. Really is shameful. My rate is not 1, is: 0.	negative
title: Highlights of Nature Down Under [SEP] content: This is an odd little hybrid, but quite useful. With beautiful photos, like a coffee table book, but small in size; with many maps, but none detailed enough to really use; with travel suggestions, but little "getting there" or "where to stay" information, it is a little bit of this and a little bit of that. What it does, more than say "Watching Wildlife," is put the flora and fauna in an ecological and evolutionary context, explaining why a particular species or area is unusual, and worth seeing. There are many sidebars with interesting natural history, and references to recent scientific studies along this line. But it is also a guide to the highlights of where to see nature in Australia.Bottom line is, you will need other guides to fully plan an ecotourist trip to Oz, but you will get a lot more out of the trip if you read this book first.	positive
title: It won't get you anywhere [SEP] content: 1: I bought this course. 2: There wasn't enough vocabulary to explain the dialogues and I spent more money buying a dictionary. 3: There wasn't enough in the way of explaining the language and I spent yet more money buying a grammar (Prista's, very good). 4: The recordings were too fast and not clear, I gave them up. 5: The course is disorganised, goes back and forward, not in a steady progression and I got frustrated. 6: I gave up the course all together. Not a happy story. I cannot recommend this course at all.	negative
title: No One Stays in Downtown These Days... [SEP] content: Love this album- definitely Al's best from his R&B;/Pop crossover period. The hit "We're In This Love Together", the funky "Roof Garden" (which contains the lyric mentioned in the title), "Closer To Your Love", his sly take on "Teach Me Tonight"...all fantastic.The highlight has got to be the title track. I nice melody punctuated by horns and Al's dreamy falsetto...soaring during the chorus, which contains the wonderful line "your love has opened eyes that couldn't see..." Just a lovely, lovely musical moment.This may not be everyone's taste, but if you love smooth, jazz-informed R&B;, this is a must have.	positive
title: Faulty [SEP] content: It seems like only half or maybe 2/3 of the discs actually worked. The price was nice, but...not if the discs didn't work.	negative
title: didn't work for me [SEP] content: This transmitter didn't work for me. Had no power when I plugged it into the cigarette lighter. I have a Toyota Corolla. Have to return. Very disappointed.	negative
title: Complete Tripe [SEP] content: If you enjoy TRL this one is for you. Otherwise move on and find something interesting to listen to. Jimmy and Britney would make a great pair wouldn't they?	negative
title: Ideal Resource for all Essential Oil Users [SEP] content: This is a wealth of information for anyone who uses essential oils and aromatherapy in any way. It is literally PACKED with information for the beginner (newbie) to the advanced holistic consumer. I highly recommend it!	positive
title: Great item! [SEP] content: I just set up this bouncer for the first time and it was very easy. The kids loved it and I am so happy I didn't buy a regular bouncer as the obstacle course kept them occupied for hours. I have noticed with regular bouncers the kids lose interest after 5-10 minutes. Not with the obstacle course - I think the kids played for at least 1.5 hours before finally taking a little break. It wasn't that difficult to put away (it helped to have an extra set of hands). The product is well made and I couldn't be happier. I also feel lucky as I bought this 2 weeks ago from Amazon and paid $299, wow, the price has gone up. Well, worth it.	positive
title: Did not meet my needs! [SEP] content: Two star rating is because the transmission/receiption is very poor on the product.I purchased this for my iPhone--while I understand the product description does not include the iPhone in any of it's claims. For the iPhone, the product does not charge...just for FUTURE REFERENCE.	negative
title: Sadly, a very poor performance by Groban [SEP] content: I was extremely excited when the "Live at the Greek" concert DVD went on sale in Christmas. With all the pre-release reviews (like the one above) from rabid fans I was sure this one would be yet another beautiful recording by Josh Groban. To my great shock and disappointment, Josh Groban's voice was very poor, very nasaly and he looked less so different. The once gorgeous looking and gorgeous sounding guy is sadly no more. His stage presence is uncomfortable because he knew his voice wasn't up to par. Not even close. Too bad for Groban. I can tell that even here on Amazon his sales record isn't even close to bottom. I returned mine.	negative
title: Very good and cheap CF card [SEP] content: I am using this card for my Dell Axim PDA. I have to say that it has not given me any trouble so far for the last 2 months. The card is working pretty good. I also have an SD card and a USB thumb drive from the same company and they are marvelous. Maybe the transfer rate is slower than the most epensive cards but for the price this is perfect.	positive
title: Oh, behave... [SEP] content: ... The music is fun, danceable and lively. My 3 and 5 year old boys love the CD as much as they do the TV show. We explained why the CD has British accents and then continued to dance to the infectious songs. Didn't seem to stop their enjoyment of the music in the least. ...	positive
title: Captivating [SEP] content: I read this book six years ago, and I still recommend it to others. It really is a fascinating look into the life of a geisha. This was the first 'memoir' type book that I have read, and I honestly couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the movie to come out!	positive
title: Falsely advertised as being New. [SEP] content: Falsely advertised as being new. This manual is full of markings and in poor condition. The manual was advertised as "new" though it is clearly used. I could have purchased 5 truly used manuals for the cost of this purchase.	negative
title: not very good. [SEP] content: It wasn't the worst movie ever, but overall it wasn't very good. Had some spanking scenes, but hinted at more.	negative
title: Attaching Anxiety & Depression [SEP] content: I found the information to be helpful. Change is difficult, but the lessons in this presentation are of immediate help and something for continuous benefit.	positive
title: Barely Watchable [SEP] content: I just thought this was a terrible movie. It was incredibly predictable and cliche'd. The plot line didn't make much sense. Seeing the same events play out over and over again started to get boring. They seemed to be trying to get a sort of "24" type of tension going with a ticking clock, but it didn't work. I would skip it.	negative
title: Difficult but thought provoking read [SEP] content: The author's prosaic writing style did not immediately engage me and I almost put the book down two-thirds of the way through. I'm glad I stuck with it - although it turns out to be a harrowing story with no easy answers. The author has tackled the subjects of faith, suffering, cultural clashes, love and betrayal. She has done it remarkably well for a first time novelist. The story will stay with me for a long time.	positive
title: Look for past ed. they just changed the cover [SEP] content: I used this book for a college literature class. It is a great book, I loved most all of the short stories, plays, poems and more. I only thing is that before buying this book look for past ed. I bought this one not knowing that I had the book in the ed. before. The cover is different but that is all my friend had the older book and was just fine, Save some money.	positive
title: Rude Customer support [SEP] content: Haven't used it yet...but the item was not packaged with the correct nuts/bolts. When I called the company encountered a very rude customer service rep. Hope the turkey leaves a better taste in my mouth than the company itself. Not the way to do business.	negative
title: Norelco Moi Shaver [SEP] content: This electric shaver is as good as any others that I have used. I have been using it for about 1 week and find that it works better for me with a shaving cream or soap. My legs feel just as smooth after shaving with this product as with the razor blade and the best part is I don't cut my legs!I think the expectations from disappointed users are that it cuts as fast as a razor blade. You do need to go slower and sometimes go over the area twice. You will not find an electric shaver that cuts like a blade. The plus features over other electrics are compact size,shaped like razor blade razors, wet/dry feature, and small charger.Hopefully it gets even better after 21 days as has been the experience of other users.Will keep using.	positive
title: Excellent Overview [SEP] content: This book is an excellent overview on said topic. Clean, concise, and practical, it's often referenced.	positive
title: Favorite books ever! [SEP] content: This is now my all time favorite book ever! I loved the range of emotions that this book captured. The characters are so well developed and detailed you can picture them perfectly! I could read this a hundred times and still want to read it again!	positive
title: Solaray 900 St Johns Wort [SEP] content: These are about one half priced of what I paid at my local health food store.	negative
title: Clearly written and accurate, a "must read" [SEP] content: Wayne Sarf's Little Bighorn Campaign is a clearly written and accurate account of the famous battle of 1876. Its other great virtue is balance. Sarf presents all aspects of this complex event in a fair and readable manner, a "must read" for anyone interested in the Littler Bighorn Campaign.	positive
title: Adrenaline rush [SEP] content: Two guys rob some other guys of drugs...then one complicated, crazy ride ensues. It was an action-packed film with more realism in its violence than most American films, as some other reviewers have pointed out. It is no holds barred and no pretend martial arts or other fighting style involved. The dialogue was minimal, but most of the story could be followed easily through the action. It ties all characters together like a bow on a present, but with frayed edges and bloodstained blotches. The glue of the film was the single-mindedness of a father, who is chased by both gang members, and members of his station through a nightclub. This nightclub seems to have something for everyone in its labyrinthine layout from classy to seedy. It was just plain fun. Hope you enjoy it,too.	positive
title: Great music! [SEP] content: You can never go wrong with James Blunt! Great heart felt music. Easy listening. I would buy this cd 1000xs !!!!	positive
title: Surprisingly Bad [SEP] content: I had high hopes for this movie seeing the acclaim it received from various circles.Well, the proof is in the viewing and this one is not worth the bother.What starts out as a great setting with some wonderful cinematography soon turns into the run of the mill humans-running-and-hiding-from-creatures-who-can-make-mince-meat-out-of-them. Gee, how original?Throw in the very tired crisis movie cliches, which others have referred to in their reviews and what could have been a great movie becomes a snoozer. Avoid this one. It's not worth your time.	negative
title: Very difficult to use - wish I had bought another brand [SEP] content: I've always had Canon printers and fax machines (although once I had an Epson printer), but thought I would buy HP this time for various reasons. I am very, very disappointed in this product. It is very hard to use, and seems flimsy. There is a whole complicated setup process to do business-size envelopes, and even then it ends up tearing the envelope flaps a lot of the time. I still have no clue as to how to do smaller-size envelopes on this printer - it does not give you the option to do that. The print quality is very good and I don't find the printer to be noisy, but in terms of setup and especially use, this is the most difficult printer I have ever owned. I wish I had bought another Canon instead.	negative
title: a name you can trust [SEP] content: graco is a brand that has been in households for many years. that is why i chose to buy this product. i have been using graco products since my first child was born in 1979. 4 kids, 6 grandchildren, and a daycare business later; the quality of their products is by far better than most on the market today. i have never had a graco product fall apart. the carseats are all easy to use. the harness system takes an extra moment, but it's worth it to make sure your child is properly restrained. your children are precious cargo and should be treated as such.	positive
title: Love it!! [SEP] content: Wonderful acting, Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller are just incredible in this Jane Austen classic. His rendition of Mr. Knightly would have to be my favorite. Also, I like that in this version, the relationship between Emma and her father is more thoroughly developed, you really feel how much they love each other.The rendition of Mr. Churchill and Jane Fairfax was also well acted, not my favorites but they did an adequate job.All in all, a beautiful version!!	positive
title: The "Real" New Mexico Revealed [SEP] content: The Milagro Beanfield War is the real New Mexico. It is full of the characters and natural beauty that I love so much about my home. Sure the storyline is a bit 'Hollywood' with the evil Anglo land developer taking advantage of the poor Hispanic farmer. Get beyond that and look at the sub-plots and the characters and the sets ... that's New Mexico. And the soundtrack!!! Wow!!!OK I love this movie. If I get homesick on my frequent travels I can always pop it in the player and see the beautiful mountains near Truchas, and almost smell the green chili roasting. Bring on the enchaladas (red or green - your choice) and the sopapillas with honey.Robert Redford did a great job converting Nichol's book to the screen. Sure he had to combine a couple of characters into Amarante .. and the Smokey the Bear wars is glossed over .. so read the book. The movie is still entertaining -- no matter how many times I watch it -- and the characters are memorable. Buy and keep this movie.	positive
title: as advertised [SEP] content: I have used this microphone every day for the past month. I have been satisfied with the quality of the sound and the ease of use. There is no red light to let me know that the battery has enough charge or when to replace it. Highly recommended	positive
title: Fan-freakin'-tastic! 9 discs of Alien goodness! [SEP] content: Why did I wait so long to purchase this? Okay, I didn't want to pay full price. Had to go on sale sometime. But, man, what I've been missing! Two versions of all 4 films, an extra "bonus features" disc for each film with preproduction, production, and postproduction featurettes, stills, etc. Plus yet an extra bonus disc to cap it off at 9 discs!Man, between this and theThe Ultimate Matrix Collection(that's just as good @ 10 discs), my friends and family may not see me for months! So much good stuff to watch...So happy to finally have this in my hot little hands. Aliens is still my favorite movie, bar none. In the sci-fi genre,The Fifth Elementand theRiddick Trilogyhave come close. But my loyalty will always remain with the first, and the best. Aliens (yes, I know Alien came first, but Aliens was the best-of-breed).	positive
title: HDD crashed after two months [SEP] content: WD is a well-regarded brand and they will be shipping me a new drive, but after the thing crashed on me after only a couple of months, I will no longer trust my data to WD. I have had Maxtor and Seagate drives (generally much cheaper) that have been running for years.	negative
title: Great Book! [SEP] content: My eight year old and ten year old really enjoy this book. The stories are funny, and still maintain the morals of traditional fairy tails. They especially like "The Real Story of Sleeping Beauty"	positive
title: SingleGayMale [SEP] content: Great Movie !!! Matthew B. Pays a great role . And performs excellent , this is back when playing a Gay Man got rumors that you could be gay. Thanks to Matthew B , this is the beginning of straight actors playing gay men and doing a great job.	positive
title: Be warned!! [SEP] content: Don't read this book if you want to learn about the man that was Hamilton. If your only interest is the politics and financial events of his day then this is the book for you. There is little or no discussion about Hamiltons personal life, his children, his habits, his wife, his education, his thoughts, his friends, even his death and the events arounding it are but a few paragraphs. Look elsewhere to learn about Hamilton.	negative
title: music luver [SEP] content: I'm not to happy with this buy the one track on the radio is good however the rest of the album does not have great tracks usually the case when you buy a CD like this one hit wonder still have to inpress me not a must to buy.	negative
title: The Best of Everything [SEP] content: Jane Monheit sings with angelic quality to the point the listener is moved and changed by the sound. Her voice control of each note is so pure, it emphasizes the extent of skill of her extraordinary talent. It is the voice and note control that amazes the listener.	positive
title: a sham [SEP] content: the problem with sarah is she cannot decide if she'd like to be tori amos or celiene dion. she fails miserably at both. for an example of a TRULY passionate live performance, try ani difranco's "living in clip" or tori amos' "to venus and back".	negative
title: The best present for my 3 year old! [SEP] content: We bought this for our daughter's 3rd birthday a month ago along with the easel and she LOVES it. My husband put it together with relative ease and had it set up for the next morning so she could start painting and drawing. The supplies are great, although I wish it came with more markers! The paintbrushes and cups are very sturdy and while I might buy some different paint due to the staining we had the first few nights, they're all high-quality items. We're very happy with the product!	positive
title: If you could give less than one star, I would [SEP] content: Bought this for my husband's birthday at the end of July. By mid September, it was broken and unusable. After reading some reviews, we found we had the same problem as many other buyers. A small plastic part broke inside, now the plate would not sit right or heat. We looked up the "warranty" on the product. After reading, we found out that we were required to ship the popper back to them and send along another $10 for the return shipping. We could have bought another popper for all the money spent in shipping. We called the "customer service" department to discuss it with them and they were unwilling to work with us unless we sent the popper and money along. Way to stand behind your products Cuisinart! For sure we will NEVER buy another product from them and will use every opportunity to tell everyone else not to as well. Save your self the time and money and buy something else.	negative
title: savages [SEP] content: I really didn't like this movie and it dragged to much and didn't have much of a story line to it	negative
title: Jimmy Hunt plays a Police Chief in a few scenes. [SEP] content: You've seen the 1953 version,Invaders from Mars (Special Edition), now see the even wierder and much longer 1986 version with an all-star cast: Karen Black, Timothy Bottoms, Laraine Newman, James Karen. Bud Cort and Louise Fletcher. This one is far-fetched too, but it might make you like the original instead. The boy is played by Karen Black's real son, Hunter Carson.The boy from the original 1953 film, Jimmy Hunt, plays a Police Chief in this one. He is the one on the right.	negative
title: Not worth the price! [SEP] content: I bought this for my husband for Christmas being that he is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan and after 2 weeks the Cowboys emblem fell off! Now all we have is a coffee mug with a glue spot on it. Should have spent less money and got something that was engraved into the stainless steel! NOt recommended!	negative
title: I appreciate the Intent, but ... [SEP] content: Rosemary's Baby meets the Sentinal and Burnt Offerings .... all movies I really liked. The slow burn works great in a good thriller, but in order for it to work, you need just a lil' bit more happening than happens here for a very long time. I loved the intent to make a throwback horror film, but I think this is just way too padded with ... nothing. No point at all in the opening where she finds a new apartment (but fun to see Dee Wallace(Stone))and lots of plodding scenes of sitting around. Always a hoot to see Woronov, though. This needed more of a kick-start to keep the tedium from setting in before the finale.	negative
title: Iceland Noir [SEP] content: A complete pleasure. Count me a fan. Complex enough to be intersting and to keep me guessing. The daughter gets on my nerves - wouldn't mind if she gets killed off down the road take the x-wife too - getting rid of them would just add to the Noir quality of Erlindur's character. Loved the setting - Iceland completely new to me! I am a fan of mysteries set outside the USA. This completely worked for me.	positive
title: A must for all Reiki Channels [SEP] content: I was introduced to this book at about the same time as I did my Rieki 1, and found it to be exactly what I needed at that time to help clarify the amazing things that were happening to me. I went on to do my Reiki 2 and am now an apprentice master. I have lent my copy of this book to several Reiki friends who in 9 out of 10 cases have gone on to buy their own copies. The information is clear, easy to understand and of great benefit to not only those considering Reiki, or those new to Reiki, but also those who are starting to teach Reiki, it covers the whole range, and does it very well. The reason I have not given this book the full five points, is due to the overly heavy emphasis on incest, wicca & feminism, these subjects are out of place in this Essential Reiki book, there are other arenas for discussing and dealing with these subjects.	positive
title: Ghost Whisperer season 3. [SEP] content: I dont know it seemed a bit same old same old, just one episode Id like to see ghosts just leave Melinda alone so we can see her hot husband (awww Jim..) and her auctualy have a normal married life!!Whilst this season didnt impress as much as the last two it still makes me keen for season 4, I mean 1 slow season shouldnt turn me off completely? Right?	negative
title: good resource, but a bit out of date [SEP] content: This book is a good though outdated overview of the investment banking business. I would also strongly recommend instead or in additionthe Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking.... The Vault guide includes moredetailed overviews of all the departments and functions of an investmentbank including corporate finance, M&A, sales, trading, private clientservices, credit, etc. If you are a job seeker in investment bankingalso try the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which contains actualinvestment banking finance interview questions and answers and which Ifound to be enormously valuable in my Wall Street job search.	positive
title: Grandsaons Birthday Gift [SEP] content: I purchased the Tractor for my grandson....the look on his face when he saw it was priceless!I wanted one that was a minture of the "John Deere" Tractor his Daddy uses on the yard.It was just that a perfect duplicate...	positive
title: Don't Bother [SEP] content: I was so disappointed by this book! All the author does is offer generic advice to the age old questions. Her answer to all problems is "search the internet." And since she did so much research it would have been nice to have a list of good dating sites and resources at the very least. Don't waste your money, you can find the same info. that's in this book on the web.	negative
title: It didn't really Work for Me. [SEP] content: The chimney didn't work for me at all. I followed the directions and all the chimney did was smoke and the charcoal remained the same.	negative
title: The best history of the beginning of the Civil War [SEP] content: This book will tell you more about how the Civil War got rolling than any other. It has all the characters a major novel will have, all real. If you want to know how things fell apart in 1860 and 1861, this is where to go.	positive
title: Worn on overseas flight [SEP] content: Bought a pair for myself and one for my husband as well. With minimal getting up and walking around, neither one of us had the least bit of swelling or fatigue. Great product!	positive
title: easy flying [SEP] content: This game runs best on win 95 or 98. This game is easy to play, if you are not good with avoiding all the SAMs than put it in invincable mode. Some of the graphics look a little flat at times. I like the game play and free flight. This is a fun and interesting game.	positive
title: wife [SEP] content: I dont know what to say. I really think the movie is bad. everything about it is bad. wow sorry I know my wife is all dreamy eyes over it but this nothing more then a teenage vampire drama and that is all. shiny vampire.... wow do not buy this. read a book or watch paint dry it be better then this	negative
title: Amazed [SEP] content: I know many have seen this picture before, but it added so much more seeing it at home and being able to cry freely, knowing what I know now. I was in "The Duke's" final days with him and it just made it that more special. I bought it for someone special, who could not believe that I would be ever able to find it again since it had been so long. It made him smile, yes cry, and even laughed a few times. The price was right, the search was easy, and it is a movie that will be treasured forever.	positive
title: For the beginner [SEP] content: If you know anything about garnishing this book is not for you. The stuff in here is very simple. After I got it, I figured out it was a waste of time and money.	negative
title: You Won't Be Disappointed! [SEP] content: This is by far the best gospel CD I have ever purchased! Kurt Carr does something that few Christian artists experiment with in the gospel music industry. He touches people of every nation by intertwining different musical styles and sounds while adding theatrical or dramatic elements. The Kurt Carr singers are excellent!! Each song is anointed!! You will be blessed! I listen to One Church at home and at work and each message makes my day a little brighter. Get this album now!	positive
title: Better than Blessing! [SEP] content: OK, OK--so this wasn't one of Jude's best books, but I have to admit that I liked it much better than the Blessing! I personally like hearing about those too perfect, too rich, too handsome, too lovely and too loving Montgomerys and Taggerts! I was glad to see the family return. I felt that I learned a bit about both Fiona and Ace, and could see how their relationship grew. I like my ends tightly knit though, and wondered if Ace's family had felt rejected by him or if he felt estranged from them because of his unusual choice of lifestyle. (I am talking about his parents here, not his cousins.) Of course, the outcome was obvious, but I want my romances to end happily. All in all though, I think that Historical romance is the genre in which Jude excells, and I wish she would return to that. (I am glad to see her leave that goofy time travel/reincarnation stuff behind!)	negative
title: Great read [SEP] content: I am reading it for the third time. It is easy to read and perhaps I will get it all by the time I read it five or six times. I recommend it to anyone.	positive
title: very comfortable [SEP] content: So far very pleased. Received these boots the next day, a day sooner than expected. They wear ,and act like a sneaker on your foot. But they provide the protection as a boot should. Hunting season in a week I will put them to the test then!? Miles of rocks and cactus of Colorado will test there durability.The option of getting a great fit is a welcome change to; since I have a wide foot. Most shoes are a one sizes fits few option these are great!!	positive
title: Yikes! [SEP] content: I've had this for 2 months. In the beginning, it worked great! Picked up all sorts of things, and it was really easy to use. Fast forward to today and it basically caught on fire. Started smoking, making weird noises, shaking, and the smell....oh the smell. It is going to take weeks of the burning rubber smell to get out of my home. Buyer beware!	negative
title: Way too long...and drawn out [SEP] content: I started off liking it and then more than halfway through I just quit reading because I lost interest. This book is way too long and drawn out. I absolutely hated the main character Sienna and had no interest in what happened to her. The author could've killed her off halfway through and called it a day.	negative
title: Still a good system [SEP] content: N64 has a few good games that are still fun to play. Games such as Doom & Zelda.	positive
title: Science fiction, fast and fun [SEP] content: Read page 86 aloud for one of the author's puns. The book combines all the best elements of a good SF story. A wicked sense of humor combined with a solid story and with great characters. Most importantly, it takes a sideways view of the world(s)which makes me think about this world in a different way.	positive
title: Third Watch Even Got My HUSBAND Watching! [SEP] content: Third Watch is the first program that my pilot husband could hardly wait till the next episode. After watching a 2003 re-run episode, we cued TIVO to record all episodes and found ourselves watching five times a week till we got caught up with 2004 new season! The NYFD's challenges, the NYPD's decision-making and the EMT's caring will take your mind off your own stresses in life! Third Watch is an excellent action-packed must-see show. Now if we could just get it in DVD!!	positive
title: Green Foods - Green Magma - OK but... [SEP] content: When I had ordered this last year I'd received the original Dr. Hagiwara Green Magma made in Japan; the one in a glass jar. When it recently came time to re-order, I just went to my trusty Amazon account, found the old order, and re-ordered the same thing. However, what I received this time is the green magma that's made in the US and comes in a plastic container.The original from Japan is much better; it dissolves better in water and is a darker green. Plus, the glass container seems to keep the green magma fresher.I'm sure the American version works the same way as the Japanese version, but beware if you're expecting the real stuff from Japan -- this isn't it.	negative
title: Certainly the best mainstream HTML book available today [SEP] content: The book is one of several Stanek books I highly recommend. Amazon made this book recommended reading a few months back and I've put it on my recommended reading list for January 1998.After comparing to many others the book is obviously the best of its class. It professes to teach you mainstream techniques and it does so with flying colors. This book and Stanek's FrontPage 98 Unleashed are the only two books I've ever given a 5-star recommendation to! If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what does.Buy this book, you'll to learn Web publishing techniques that you can use now. Stay away from books that talk about technologies you may be able to use one day in the future. That day may never come.	positive
title: a dio fan returns. . . dave pardue from mountain park ga usa [SEP] content: This record totally rocks. It has all I've missed since the early 80's days of great metal recordings. I still listen faithfully to the old ones, but to have a new one that is so good is a nice surprise. I believe people come here to do their craft their way, and Ronnie does his craft his way and says to heck with the current trend, this is what I'm doing like it or not. Well, I love it, and cudos to him for trusting his heart rather than current trends and dumb record label bosses and greedy radio stations. Ronnie you rock. I love what you do and always will. Thanks for this album.	positive

title: boring and lame story [SEP] content: We own all the Barbie movies and this one was right up there with Thumbelina. It had a short and weak story. Doesn't even compare to The Diamond Castle or Three Musketeers.	negative
title: Overproduced Artist [SEP] content: Absolutely beautiful woman with a top notch make-up artist and minimal talent. How she has gotten as far as she has is a mystery to me....	negative
title: YOU MUST READ THIS, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE [SEP] content: I bought a PS2 last week and paid for the InterAct S-Video Cable. Let it be known that the cable ruined my PS2's ability to play back DVDs. Do not buy anything for you PS2 that is not made by Sony. I talked to a Sony representative today and they said using any other cable will VOID the warranty on the PS2. Luckily I was able to return my Playstation 2 to the store that I bought it from...you might not be so lucky.	negative
title: Worked fine... for a while [SEP] content: Lasted about 2 months, then died, nearly killing my engine when it overheated. Avoid this product at all costs, there are better units out there, maybe a bit more cash but worth every penny.	negative

title: works great - huge [SEP] content: I'm using this in an eTrex Legend Cx (firmware 2.40). It's huge - I fit more than half of the MetroGuide Europe v8 on the card.	positive
title: Hang - Ups is pure genius [SEP] content: This CD is amazing and the mix of punk/ska is perfectly balanced. Superman and Chris Cayton are in a world of their own. The rest of the songs are merely brilliant, infact they are better than brilliant. I really would not rate any song on this CD less than great.	positive
title: excellent and tasteful.. [SEP] content: This is a great cookbook for the whole family. At first I had a hard time finding ingredients in the stores in my area and was very frustrated.I started ordering things on line and the more things that I baked and cooked from this book, it became the bible in my kitchen. Now I have found a health food store in my area that carry almost everything.My 1 year old (that has multiple food allergies) had his first bread (muffin) and loved every bite! He also LOVES the meat loaf recipe...I made it with ground turkey instead of chopped and it turned out fine.I usually make my own tomato sauce, but when I made the lady's red sauce..my family thought it was the best!	positive
title: Much better than I expected. [SEP] content: I bought this cd because I really liked the updated versions of the Partridge Family classics. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this entire CD was really a great listening experience - especially while I'm driving or at work (the only times I really get to listen to music). Surprisingly, or maybe not, my kids love this cd. My 5 year old and 3 year old love singing along with "I Think I Love You" while sort of "dancing" in their car seats.	positive
title: scratches [SEP] content: This series is definitely an addictive one. I started the series and now can't stop watching the show or reading the books!	positive
title: THIS CD IS MASTERED FROM A VINYL RECORD!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! [SEP] content: This rating is not in regards to the album itself, but the quality of it. Do not buy this CD or anything from Ptg Records PERIOD!!! All of their released CDs are mastered from vinyl records and not from the original master tapes. They fade the songs out early to hide the rumbling sound from the vinyl. The sound is inferior compared to if the real master tapes were used. I was fooled into buying Atlantic Starr's "Radiant", thinking it was the real CD, but was gravely mistaken. Wait until whomever has the rights to the real masters to reissue this great album. Ptg records needs to shut their operation down completely and bring this deception to an end!!!	negative
title: Gwendoline movie [SEP] content: This movie was every bit as campy and good as I remember it, I have been looking for it on DVD for ages. I didn't notice any differences from the version I have on VHS from when it was first released, and I believe it was rated "R". I might have to go back and check. If you love damsel in distress movies, this one has plenty of that	positive
title: Completely shocked and devastated! [SEP] content: I just picked up (what I thought was)Lawrence Sanders' latest book and started reading it last evening. To say the least, when I read "he was the author of...." I was deeply upset and saddened. I had no idea he had passed away. I have been anxiously awaiting a new book by him so you can certainly understand why I was shocked! I shall continue to read and finish the book but it will not be the same knowing he is gone. I will certainly give Vincent Lardo a chance to redeem himself! Who knows, unless we give him a chance, we will never know if he is another L. Sanders!!	negative

title: "SIPs: blistering barnacles" :) [SEP] content: Red Rackham's Treasure, the continuation and conclusion of The Secret of the Unicorn, is the twelfth story in the Adventures of Tintin series and one of the most enjoyable and satisfying.In this tale Tintin and company set out upon the sea to find the buried treasure introduced in the previous story. Along the way we are introduced to a few of the most integral Tintin elements: Captain Haddock's family estate, Marlinspike (originally Moulinsart), where the characters will live for the remainder of the series; the deaf, absentminded, and wonderful Professor Calculus (Professor Tournesol, or Sunflower, in the original version); and plenty of antics from the Thom(p)son twins along the way.The ending of Red Rackham's Treasure is perfect and truly puts the series in motion, setting the stage for some of the most wonderful Tintin adventures of all. If not for this one, they might never have been!	positive
title: Fine Product [SEP] content: Literally the only thing I dislike about this utility key is the fact that it's so difficult to open all of the way and then close back again. On the other hand, this is better than it being too easy to open and having it stab your leg every time you put it in your pocket. Other than that, it works exactly like you would expect and the knife blade holds an edge well. Even if you don't want one for yourself it would make a nice present for a relative, husband, etc.	positive
title: Power cord with a tendency to burn [SEP] content: I have had two of these power cords and both have burned. The first after about a year of use, the second after three years of normal use. There was a class action lawsuit related to this power adapter because these cords have a tendency to fray and then burn. [...] Apple refuses to replace the adapter, saying that the problem was cause by misuse, and that I must have unplugged it from my computer incorrectly. Apple makes products that fail in dangerous ways and then refuses to accept financial responsibility for them. Think twice about buying Apple products.	negative
title: Great Welch Choirs [SEP] content: Great mens' choirs from all over Wales. Wonderful inspiring music. A unique seldom heard sound these days. Selections include choral classics and musical theater numbers. A bargain of 5 CD's.	positive
title: Awesomeness! [SEP] content: I gave this book to my brother for Christmas and it's almost as though it's super-glued to his hand now! It contains all of Poe's greatest Stories and Poems... I have absolutely no regrets about buying this product ;)	positive
title: HIGHLY Recommend THIS item [SEP] content: I used this on an HP Compaq LA2205wg screen and it fit PERFECTLY. There are 2 sides to this filter (which doesn't stick on the actual screen), one glossy and one matte. I used the matte side to face me, and from a distance the screen looks completely black. At closer proximity to the computer monitor, things are visible and if someone's standing directly behind, the screen is clearly visible. However, it has immensely increased the level of privacy and I can work happily knowing that no one's watching me from behind. The filter can be lifted for cleaning and the see through stickers that you attach to the screen are to help keep it put. Even without the stickers, the filter will stay put.Buy it, it's totally worth it, although HIGHLY priced.	positive
title: Fantasia - out! [SEP] content: 1. Fantasia (Chain Of Fools) - Nothing new, nothing special. As bad as her TV performances. Grade: F2. George(Me And Mrs. Jones) - Good. Grade: B3. Diana (I Heard It Through The Grapevine) - Good. Grade: B+4. La Toya (If You Don't Know Me By Now)- Wow! Grade: A5. Jennifer (Neither One Of Us)- Overdone vocals. Grade: D6.

Ensemble (Ain't No Mountain High Enough)- The Duck's squeaky voice towers over everyone's. Grade: D-Good CD overall. Delete Fantasia's number and re-do the ensemble and this album will improve significantly.	positive
title: Stay Away [SEP] content: Just bought NCAA 2003 and the InterAct memory card. Played eight games, saved my dynasty and went to bed. Next day, my files were corrupt.I then tried to re-save other dynasties and all of them were corrupt.I'm bummed, I'd love to have the 1000 blocks but if it's not reliable, it ain't worth it.Don't buy this card, unfortunately. You can't trust it.	negative
title: Laltin Dictionary [SEP] content: Well written, but I need a bigger book. This one does not have all the words that I need. Next time I will order a larger one, perhaps by a different publisher.	positive
title: excellent book [SEP] content: Focaccia is my favourite bread, and since I live in Italy I get to eat it as much as I want. But I wanted to try making it on my own, and this book really helped me.The recipes here are amazing and they really work. They are easy and tasty (they do taste better than the ones I buy at my local bakery). Also the variety is great. The one I like the best is "Focaccia Andrea Doria" but they are all excellent. The book is also filled with beautiful photos. Enjoy it.	positive
title: Not really useful [SEP] content: This was the 8th manual in my library I have for running my NWN module and it is the worst one so far. I really didn't find it as useful as I though it would be. I needed it for the 3rd edition gods and really, it doesn't give me any more info then the 3 primary books (DM, Players, Monster). In fact, It seems to contradict them a bit. I shouldn't of purchased this book, it really will just rot a bit. For a module designer who's trying to add deities in to their NWN module, its really not worth it.	negative
title: Amazing current day hard sci fi page turner! [SEP] content: Well Desmedt literally blew me away, combining a bit of classic cold war history, mystery,scientific mystery and the feel of a technothriller into a book i literally read in one sit through...In a day and age where every other sci fi novel is rooted in bull@#$@ plot devices and literally is fantasy desmedt managed to take an ACTUAL theory about actual events and make it no less fantastic then a space opera. While many novels have multiple plot lines that intertwine usually some are weak and as a result your read through a chaoter just to get to another charcters POV, here every chapter change i felt pissed that i'd have to wait for a continual of this line while i felt the glee of another plotline's return, can't wait to read his next novel Dualism.Thanks for restoring my faith in current day sci fi !	positive
title: Rock Solid [SEP] content: Not as pretty as a DeWalt or others, but solid and the price is right. Plastic plugs in round supports do fall out, but a touch of Gorilla glue and they won't go anywhere. Added wheels to get a little more short distance mobility.	positive
title: The struggle between Israel and Palestinians isn't unique [SEP] content: The struggle between Israel and Palestinians isn't unique, and here Lorenzo Veracini argues that an understanding of the foundations of colonialist thought is necessary to understand the methods, concerns and results of Israel, a settler society like so many others. Other colonial regimes are examined in the course of Veracini's analysis of the dynamics of colonist thought, which refutes popular myths of the origins of Israeli-Palestinian disputes.	positive
title: This re-telling of a classic fairy tale put the "sleep" in Sleeping Beauty [SEP] content: Wow - talk about a slow read! The tale of "Sleeping Beauty" is one of my very favorites, so I picked this up with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, this re-telling failed to capture the magic part of a fairy tale retelling. I just didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe it was a case of high expectations making it seem worse than it was... McKinley definitely displayed some originality in the story itself, but overall, it was the style was that spoiled the book. No actual action took place at all... And the verb tenses were almost all passive, making the novel all just "telling", resulting in a very slow-going and boring book! What a disappointment! I have enjoyed McKinley's books in the past, but this really isn't a good example of her talent!	negative
title: A Fine Novel [SEP] content: Roscoe's novel bosts a tight narrative and engaging characters. Although admittedly a heist novel, the book serendipitously paints a cozy picture of a small New Zealand town--and although the novel succeeds in its capacity as a caper, I found myself simultaneously rooting for Warren to escape with the loot and conversely hoping that he would abandon his quest and settle down in Christchurch, the New Zealand town where the bulk of the book takes place. "Company of Thieves" is a solid read and a promising start for author Gil Roscoe.	positive
title: Deceived--not a biography [SEP] content: Oh wow I am one of the most avid Tupac Amaru Shakur fans you will ever meet. I have bought every single one of his DVD(including Juice, poetic justic, gridlock'd and gang related) his books (the rose that grew from concrete among others" and simply other documentaries and memoriabilia. He is a great and extremely talented man that managed much especially from growing up in the Baltimore ghettoes. This book, which was his "biography" is no that at all. It is merely a recollection of his life and past attributes. I must say that I was disappointed by the fact that this wasn't a biography. I must say though that how could I have expected a true biography out of a man that has been dead for 8 years almost. Although I still read this book and enjoyed it, I must rate it 4 stars.	positive
title: Offensive and ignorant piece of work [SEP] content: This program entirely neglects Einstein's achievements in favor of his disorganized sex life. This is rather like berating Casanova for not being a mathematical genius. The treatment of Einstein's failures as a family man manages to be both sanctimonious and titillating at the same time. The script is barely literate, containing many grammatical 'howlers', and there is much use of inconsequential footage. You will learn precisely nothing about science from watching this video, and not much about the man.	negative
title: Very Nice Cable Regardless of Price [SEP] content: Using this cable in a whole house audio system. Clean cuts, thick jacketing with tight stranding. Great deal for the price. Will purchase more when needed.	positive
title: Easy [SEP] content: This product is very easy to maintain. The cost of the trays is expensive but it works well. Our cat just watches it clean itself and he had no problem using it. Great invention! for us ours is a kitten 5 months old and we had to change it after 2.5 almost 3 weeks of use. need to look at other options for the replacement tray to cut some dollars. but love what it does.. NO MESS	positive
title: Hate it [SEP] content: This thing is useless and doesn't work. !! Don't waste your money get a woopie cushion instead !! !! !!	negative
title: Rated "R" for a reason [SEP] content: Gee, I guess if people are ignorant enough to play this for kids still in daycare, and the kids soil themselves and puke and wreck the van, maybe there should be a bright flashing neon sign that says "do not play for a daycare audience" rated "R" means restricted no one under 17 permitted so if you are 17 and in daycare there is a problem at home obviously	positive
title: No Linux happiness here [SEP] content: If you're running Linux on your machines, I would recommend staying away from Linksys cards. The company only supports Windows operating systemsfor thier hardware. The WRT54GX router is still nice for the range and signal strength boost, but without a matching SRX enabled adapter with Linux drivers, you may as well go with a vendor that supports Linux and avoid the hassle.	negative
title: This is XLR8 Interview full package [SEP] content: This is an excellent value. It is the full retail package of XLR8 Interview including Strata VideoShop 4.5 and all the other bundled software. The USB connector has both the RCA video connection and S-Video connection. The package also includes a cable for connecting stereo sound to the Macintosh microphone input jack. After you get it, download the free update to Interview 2.0 from the XLR8 site and the VideoShop 4.5.1 free update from their web site. Minimum system requirement is a G3 233 mhz Mac with a USB connection.	positive
title: Bleeding Through is rising to the top as an excellent metal band [SEP] content: Originating from Orange County, Cal, Bleeding Through has a history of a few albums. Their debut really wasn't anything special. Their sophomore effort was excellent. Their third album and biggest CD yet, was good, but a little bit dull. Now, they come out with their absolute best effort yet!!!The Truth is jam-pcked with meaningful lyrics, brutal riffs, machine gun drumming and very hard-rocking and even melodic bass lines. (Ryan Wombacher is my cousin). Brandon has a great singing/ screaming voice and Marta is a good keyboardist. Whether it's brutality in lyrics ("Tragedy Of Empty Streets"), brutal riffs ("Hollywood Prison"), fast and hard ("For Love And For Failing") or even a ballad, ("Line In The Sand"), this harcore punk band doesn't disappoint. My favorites are "Painkiller and "Line In The Sand".And THAT is the truth about "The Truth"	positive
title: Stone of Tears by Terry Goodkind [SEP] content: I love the eBook. If you have seen the TV series "Legend of the Seeker" you will recognize the characters. The books are richer in detail and explains more about Khalin, Richard and Zed. Be prepared for a different storyline with the books than the TV show. Regardless, I still enjoyed reading book #2. Can't wait for the next one.	positive
title: Great book! Great author! [SEP] content: You can't go wrong with a Maurice Pledger book! They are both wonderfully written and beautifully illustrated! If you have a child who is interested in animals, you must look at Pledger's books!	positive
title: A NEW way to bite the original audience ............. [SEP] content: All this stuff is second nature to rational managers. It was only written here to make money for guys selling seminars to irrational managers (or their employers) who can't be helped to be rational but can be relieved of some spare cash.	negative
title: Great garden advice [SEP] content: I first got this book from the library and had to add it to my collection. I planted my garden according to the companion suggestions. Everything is doing great and my garden never looked better with the addition of flowers to the vegetables. She has some great suggestions and I am hoping for a great harvest later this spring!	positive
title: Few Diamonds, Mostly Coal [SEP] content: I was quite disappointed with this anthology. The stories written by acknowledged "masters" of the genre such as Le Guin, Disch, Kelly and Niven read like the kind of material these talented authors would never dream of submitting. Joyce Carol Oates "Commencement," her first sci-fi story, is extremely well-written but pointless. If I were the editor of this collection, I would have sent the majority of stories back to the authors for rewrites. There are a few gems, however. New writer Laura Whitton's vibrant and challenging "Froggies" shows us what might happen if we come to care for another alien species a little too much, and Rucker and Shirley's "Pockets" is both mind-bending and terrifying. I just wish Mr. Sarrantonio would have been a bit more discriminating in accepting stories for this collection. Gardner Dozois' yearly collection is the one to read; even on off years, his choices are better than these.	negative
title: Uncomplicated, Indulgent Entertainment [SEP] content: This movie is one of the few independent films that didn't make me fall asleep within the first ten minutes. The plot, characters, and overall tone of the movie is simple. Beautiful violent women trying to find money in the desert, yet each woman has her own agenda for being there. There are girl fights, nuns, secret agents, lots of guns, and a murderous asian woman called Kinky. Personally, I liked the fact that the story was uncomplicated and the film contain many cliches. If anyone has listened to the director and cast commentary on the dvd, you'll know that this film was intended to be a fun piece of entertainment. Not an award-winning blockbuster, hailed by mainstream audiences as a work of art. It's a B movie, nothing more and nothing less. I think if you give the movie a try and don't expect to much from it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.	positive
title: Unkingly [SEP] content: Even though Stephen King wrote this novel, it was as good as the sitcoms on the WB. I have one word to describe it: horrible. It's a rare case where the movie exceeded the novel.	negative
title: A Money Hungry Excuse for an 'author'! [SEP] content: Ms. Leaming, like that dreadful photo. of herself on the cover of this 'book', makes me sick. She is obviously attempting to cause a stir, in order to sell her book. I purchased this when it first was released -- after reading it was from a fair minded 'fan' -- yeah, right! This is a great book if you have a gripe with Bette Davis -- a great female actor, even Ms. Steep says "the Best!", a great American, too -- does anyone know what Bette Davis did for our Military by organizing the Hollywood Canteen and selling War Bonds?	negative
title: Thanks [SEP] content: This is a great CD and awesome band, this is just what I wanted. thank you I will enjoy this.	positive
title: Derivative Rock [SEP] content: This could have been a nice song without the "songwriter's" touch. Nicely played though. Not worth it.	negative
title: NOT LEAK PROOF!! [SEP] content: We purchased the thermos and sippy cup at the same time. I really wanted to like both items, but they leak way too much. The thermos fell over on it's side the other day (noone noticed) and it made a huge puddle on the floor. It does do a great job at keeping liquids cold and my daughter loves the easy push button top (took her only 1-2 tries to figure it out). But, Thermos needs to do a better job on the leaking issue especially if they are claiming it's leak proof.	negative
title: Not at all what I expected [SEP] content: First off the set is used. The book looks like it was chewed on by a small rodent and it reeks like stale cigarette smoke.The cards look like regular playing cards. The book is simply pages of questions, lame questions such as "will my life be adventurous?"Seriously disappointed & will be requesting a full refund.	negative
title: illerate writer [SEP] content: This man knows nothing about Islam or the fact Islam has been at war with El Quada for 170 years. El Quada is a Turkish Ottoman drug cult that seeks to destroy Islam because of Christ. Mohammid is the messanger, Christ our older brother is the teacher, Allah has 1000 names known by man, we are all brothers in the faith and no man is the leader only God/Allah etc.	negative
title: Single serving only. [SEP] content: I expected more from Nordic Ware - it should be heavier as a "platter server". It is just an oval single-serving plate on a plastic platter. Where did all the heavy-duty metal serving platters go? The kind you could use to keep meat warm during a BBQ or a roast out of the oven?	negative
title: Excellent, could not put it down [SEP] content: Thruman's The Blacker The Berry was an outstanding piece of work. His vocabulary was exquisite. Emma Lou evoked sorry, shame, and anger in me all at once because I refused to accept her as the "underdog" and her constantly looking for the "right sort of people" to make her feel whole and accepted. I did feel empathy for her because she longed to be truly loved but did not recognize that the ultimate love comes from within and the sooner she accepted herself as a worthy human being she would forever be dissappointed in her relations with others. The book had a lot of passion and for a brief moment I thought Emma Lou was going to suffer a major depressive episode or commit suicide because she seemed so hopeless. The ending was unexpected and it left me wanting Emma Lou to say more.	positive
title: Great!! [SEP] content: Great value, for your $$, beats getting the phone company more than $20 priced ones. I can hear so well with these, sound quality is up to par, and it has an call& end button. The cord is long/ maybe it's just me idk. But awesome!! I have the LG Shine Bar and it's compatible w/ it.	positive
title: Very bad. [SEP] content: I could not even get through the whole movie. The acting was subpar, the script worse. If not for the movie Alex Cross, this would be the worst movie I've seen in my life.	negative
title: How he deals with his mother's alcoholism. [SEP] content: I think it is like Carl has reversed roles and became the parent. When he would not bail his mother out of jail after so many times of doing so. He did a great job of adapting to his new life in Wisconsin with his aunt and uncle.	positive
title: It broke. I won't miss it. [SEP] content: I've never had this happen before in any tool. One of the winding pickups on the armature broke off. When I opened up the motor, the pickup was loose in the case. One of the brushes had gotten jammed into the armature.Other than that, I found it to be an okay router. Plenty of power, but weight \ balance wise it was hard to use it smoothly. So I left it permanently mounted in my router table, and bought a Hitachi router for hand use. I am much happier using the Hitachi free hand than I was with the Skil. I won't miss this one.	negative
title: This product is a big pain! [SEP] content: First off, if you don't follow their install instructions to the very letter, you're in for trouble. Requires lots of reboots to get it working. Second thing, the cards work well communicating to other DWL-650 cards in ADHOC mode, but will not communicate in ADHOC mode with either the Lucent Orinoco Gold card or the Cisco card. Third, could not get either of my two DWL-650 cards configured to work with the Linksys wireless router in infrastructure (AP) mode, even after verifying all configurable parameters and using the latest drivers and firmware. Finally, one of my cards heats up in the laptop and stops working -- I have to pull it out, wave it around to cool it off, then put it back in. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT -- YOU WILL REGRET IT! Even though this card uses an industry standard Prism II chipset, the design around the chipset is obviously substandard.	negative
title: Not great [SEP] content: Package was opened during shipping. Bag is a brittle cellophane that was splitting while removing from box. Candy itself too sweet, slightly stale, had a grainy sugary texture, and the jelly inside was not as smooth and flavorful as it should be.	negative
title: Nice Puppet [SEP] content: The puppet is very big but the inside is made just for little hands. My daughter will love it. I would have liked the inside to be a little larger so I could play with her. Other than that great item. She is very cute and looks just like Dora the Explorer.	positive
title: very nice [SEP] content: it analyses the human species from a zoological point of view and provides hypotheses of how it has evolved.i enjoed it a lot.	positive
title: These cost around $1 at the grocery store. [SEP] content: Is it really ethical to charge over FIVE DOLLARS for ONE BOX of ninety-count facial tissues? That's more than four times what this costs in the corner store or grocery store or supermarket. What?	negative
title: Load of propaganda [SEP] content: The usual right wing propaganda flick. Not surprised since it's funded by the notoriously pro-Israeli Clarion Fund. Aghdashloo should be ashamed. If you are going to speak out against your country, due it on the factual basis of torture and human rights abuses. Not concoctions about WMDs and war plans against the US.	negative
title: What a ride! [SEP] content: From the dust jacket: ...Red Adam's Lady is a boisterous, bawdy tale of wild adventure, set against the constant dangers of medieval England. It is a story of civil war and border raids, scheming aristocrats and brawling villagers, daring escapes...Its vivid details give the reader a fascinating and realistic view of life in a medieval castle and village...The reviews here are excellent. There are times when I cringe at the brutality of an era but the writing here is so fast-paced I found I didn't have time. It's a wild ride and highly enjoyable.	positive
title: Too much talk, not enough of interest. [SEP] content: We got this for my son when he was about 1.5 and have tried it on him every month or so to see what he thinks. He is totally uninterested. There is much too much talking and too little time where he can do things. And the games provide him with very limited stuff he can do, and poor feedback for what he's done. He much prefers Read Rabbit for Baby over this.	negative
title: Buy the CD, skip the DVD [SEP] content: If you love "A Prairie Home Companion," it is fun to watch top stars perform with Garrison, and I admired how subtly he wove Lake Wobegon stories into the dialogue. However, if you expect movies to have plots, this flick isn't for you. No discernable rising action or climax, and the resolution was limp, as if Garrison ran out of ideas to tie up the direction he took the material. I wish GK had instead presented his annual joke show. Don't let the movie fool you if you've never heard "A Prairie Home Companion." It is a 100% entertaining radio show. The songs in the movie are well-performed and I was impressed with the peformances. Woody Harrelson, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin can sing!	negative
title: Nothing Great [SEP] content: The table is okay. It's definately not worth $50. I can not keep the table working for long because it sucks the batteries dry in a few days(even when I turn the table off when my daughter isn't using it). My daughter likes the toy but since the batteries die almost as soon as I put new ones in she can't play with it for long. It just collects dust.	negative
title: i wouldnt buy this again [SEP] content: I bought one of these cartridges straight from Amazon. It was listed as new but is in fact a refurbished item. I suppose this is common among toner cartridges since they get recycled. This one causes my printer to display "Toner Low". Also, it leaks toner so my printer is now a mess inside. I have never had this happen with a name brand cartridge. I give it one star for actually printing. I have emailed Radian support about the false error message and have not gotten a reply in more than a week. Save your money and buy another brand.Later: the cartridge caused my printer to stop working. I can't be sure but it appears that a plastic piece fell off into the works. Stay away from this disaster. Amazon is giving me a refund after I return it.	negative
title: Scarlett [SEP] content: I am a lover of Gone With The Wind this book is the continuation of the story of Sarlett O'Hara. When you read Scarlett you will finally have an end to her story. Loved it	positive
title: My son cant get enough of this movie!!!!!! [SEP] content: My 3 year old loves this movie! After watching this movie for the 10th time on netflix I thought i would just buy it. I read some of the reveiws, and was surprised at how many moms are giving this movie such a poor rating (but their kids love it) all because of 10 mins of the "nightmare train". The first time my son watched it he got scared yes, but all i had to say was little engine will do it buddy. He got all excited and started cheer little engine on. Now we watch it he says here come the mean train. Good luck everyone!!!!!!	positive
title: Listen to the lyrics.... [SEP] content: "...I want to make you move because you're standing still..." What?? I snore lyrics like these in my sleep. And how about: " This club could close in three weeks; that would be cool with me". I'm sorry, but these lyrics are really corny. Maybe they have other good songs up their sleeves. When I hear one on the radio, I'll think about purchasing one of their future albums.	negative
title: K&N [SEP] content: Increased my horse power in my 300zx significantly! Definitely buy again. Product is great. Also would like some decals if you have any?	positive
title: Very good tactics to keep focused! [SEP] content: Sam is a excellent teacher and knows his stuff. He has taught this in schools, in lecture halls, and in corporate settings. His ways get results.This book does show you how to retain focuse.I also read a great book on concentration, that was also excellent, and I have to also recommend it too:The Power Of Concentration: Make Yourself Whatever You Desire!Both books will work together well.	positive
title: Oh my goodness what a shocker!! [SEP] content: I cannot for the life of me understand why people are giving this film more than 1 star. It is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen! Why a stellar cast such as this would come on board this project is beyond me, and how such a great director (or so I thought) managed to make such a bad film is only explained by the woeful script. It's a stinker. Really. PS - and what's with Garry Shandling? Who thought it was a good idea to cast him in a leading role?	negative
title: Great for Beginners [SEP] content: After reading previous reviews I decided to take a gander on this book. It was definitely money well spent. It's great for beginners who really need to learn the simple but often forgotten basics of designs. It goes over, layout to use of grids and typography; giving examples throughout the book to also help you visualize it in the correct manner. The images in the book are great for inspiration and ideas for when you sit down and design. I'm just starting off in this business and I enjoy learning about anything that has to do it and this is definitely a great beginning for someone who's starting off in this field as well.	positive
title: Science Fiction....... [SEP] content: There is almost zero credibility in this book. One of the biggest examples would be the exact nature of how things are in the afterlife, as though he has seen it, and he knows for sure. This book is, however, a great novel if you read it as science fiction.	negative
title: Worst book ever? [SEP] content: I had never read anything by Dan Brown before, so I decided to see what the hype is all about, and step in. Man, it was an experience! Never have I seen such a exquisite collection of flat characters and implausible plot turns. I was almost impressed. Well, Constant Reader sums up my opinion pretty well on this page, so I won't wast more time on this book than I already have.	negative
title: recieved mine dead on arrival! [SEP] content: buyers beware... i just recieved the small one today, and the batteries were dead :(.	negative
title: This girl needs to GIVE UP and BACK OFF [SEP] content: Her first album was fine-"Let's Get Loud" and "Waiting For Tonight" were so much fun-but J. Lo and This Is Me...Then are CRAP! Why is she trying SOOOO hard to shove down the planet's throat that she's 'real'? Jesus Christ.....first the original "I'm Real," then a remix, THEN she friggin tells us again in Jenny From The Block. Someone trying so hard to say they're real is obviously NOT. J. Lo, you should do a song called "I'm Not Real." That would be far more accurate. You're just a figment of the music world's imagination, and nothing more. You're a puppet. You're a fake. The last thing you are is 'real.'	negative
title: Good for international travel [SEP] content: I purchased this travel kit in preparation for going abroad for 3 months. The charger was compatable in all of the countries in which I charged the battery (Finland, The Netherlands, France, Lithuania and Latvia). The charger worked well and I always had enough power. One draw back was that the internationa plug and adapter tended to slip apart during use. Once I notice this, I frequently checked the connection to avoid this mishap. I would have preferred a smaller case too.	positive
title: A Disaster on HD DVD [SEP] content: If you wonder why you never heard of it in the theaters, wonder no more.What a flop...If you must buy, get it on Regular DVD and save your cash.	negative
title: The Art of happiness [SEP] content: I realized by reading this book how out of touch I have been with spiritual practices. Thanks Dalai Lama for reminding me what is important in life and the role these practices play in attaining happiness.	positive
title: A fun book to read [SEP] content: I realy enjoyed reading this book. It was very well written and I didn't want this book to end. Also, because of its late-1980s timeline, it brought back further memories for me, since I used live and work in Northern NJ at that time.	positive
title: Tiresome [SEP] content: This book was a featured selection on Good Morning America which caused me to receive it as a gift. Having now slogged through it, I'm forced to conclude that [the] book club has been reborn on GMA. If The Dive is an example, GMA is making the same kind of selections...namely novels dealing with angst- and guilt-ridden women in excruciating detail while ignoring any semblance of good plot development.There's a big market for books like The Dive. No doubt the same market that [some talkshows] target[s]. However, unless engaging in several hundred pages of handwringing and indecision with a protagonist is what you want, take a pass on this book.	negative
title: Courage My Love: A Book to Light an Honest Path [SEP] content: Merle Shain wrote with an illuminated honesty that lit the dark places of all of our lives. Her simple truth and beauty helped me navigate through some rough waters and I would recommend her books to everyone who ever struggled with relationships in any part of their life. She lives on in all of us who loved her lucid and profound writing.	positive
title: Shipping [SEP] content: I recently ordered this book for my daughter; it was on her summer reading list. We are new to the area and I needed this book quickly. I placed my order and received it before the expected date of delivery :) My daughter has finished the book and loved it. I will read it and get back to you on the actual book.	positive
title: Concise, easy to read and riddled with errors. [SEP] content: A good introduction as long as the reader relies on the prose sections, and not the illustations or the study questions. Shows evidence of hasty and slipshod editing. My CCNA exam contained a large number of questions on topics not covered by this book.	negative
title: From American Baby Magazine: June 2000 [SEP] content: In his humorous, tell-it-like-it-is book, My Boys Can Swim, Ian Davis speaks out - man to man - to reveal everything future Dads need to know about their wife's pregnancy. "It's very important to recognize the two stages of morning sickness: green, and green and it's all your fault." Davis discovers, and then learns, "this is when you leave the house." This pregnancy primer certainly won't answer any medical questions that might arise. It's more like Cliff Notes for husbands - what to expect when your wife is expecting and her emotions are running wild. We recommend moms-to-be also take a peek at this guy's guide: You'll gawk and giggle at the sometimes unthinkable thoughts that go through Davis's head.	positive
title: not good [SEP] content: This book is just bad the designs are childish, and undeveloped. I give it a two only because I have used a couple of the images but only after alot of altering.	negative
title: Is there an editor in the house? [SEP] content: I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but I have to say I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in the proof-reading and editing. Three major errors in the first 12 pages is rediculous.The author can't even get the timing right. He indicates that Max and Michael have known each other for 18 years before leaving Roswell. They were six when they came out of the pods and weren't reunited for two years after that. This makes only 10 or 11 years together. Not 18. (although I would agree to 12 if you want to count the day wandering in the desert together.)It's so filled with errors, I'd think it was a vanity press edition of a fan-fiction. Although I've read better fan-fiction, too.There are some good points, but in general, I'm not at all impressed.	negative
title: beautiful harmonies, great songs! [SEP] content: if you like harmonies, interesting lyrics, and well...good music, i'd recommend picking this indie bands second CD up. i've got both and love this one more than the first. just hope they get down to Cali sometime soon! (they sound a bit like Sarah, Indigo Girls, and others but are unique).	positive
title: Got A Minute? [SEP] content: If you're short of time but looking for some divine inspiration, this book is for you. Snappy, two-page write-ups describe each of 50 techniques guaranteed to stir up some heat in the bedroom department. Adding to the lessons are some very funky illustrations by Sarah Young. Yummy! A word of warning, though: Although this would make a GREAT Valentine's gift for longtime couples, a new partner might find some of it a little on the kinky side. Then again, why not give them a copy and find out?My main complaint with the book is that it seems to have vanished from the literary scene so soon. As I write this, it isn't even available at Amazon.com anymore. If it doesn't reappear, look for a copy at one of the big online used book vendors (where I snagged my cherished copy).	positive
title: It grew on me! [SEP] content: When I first listened to this album I think much of it. I found it little depressing compared to "Lay it Down," but after listing to it for a while it really grew on me. Now I find the music incredibly soothing. While it doesn't make the best first impression, it's very well done.	positive
title: TIMOTHY DALTON IS NOT JAMES BOND! [SEP] content: This guy just does not work for this part! He makes a movie that could be sort of good into a absolutely terrible film.I am glad he only lasted for 2 movies before the next bond came along.	negative
title: One of the best metal albums of all time [SEP] content: I find it hard to believe this album is out of print. If you have a chance, or the cash to buy it from a collector, then do so. This disc is truly Trouble's most inspired and noteworthy effort to date. Eric Wanger has an absolutely incredible voice and the emotional thrust of the disc is powered so heavily by it. Production-wise it stands alone. Like other bands, who went to Def American, something clicked. There is something inexplicably real about this disc. It's the closest you will get to hearing what Trouble sounds like live. The first time I saw these gentelmen they were opening for Savatage at the Agora in Cleveland, Ohio, and touring for this album. INCREDIBLE!! This album makes the top ten greatest metal albums of all time easily. The "trouble" is that it's not in print right now. I hope that Trouble will re-release the disc someday, because it stands alone as their best album.	positive
title: Well, OK for macrobiotics, I guess... [SEP] content: Somewhere in this long title should appear the word "macrobiotic" so that people who are not interested could avoid buying the book!Macrobiotic food is boring and even though often it has no meat or dairy, it is by no means similar to the lush and mouthwatering vegetarian or vegan food.The book is huge so I thought I would get a bit from my money and I tried several of the recipes... to results from mildly disastrous to really bad. I've been a vegetarian for more than 15 years and can usually cook to the applause of meat-eating friends so I don't think the fault was mine...As someone else said, if you a vegetarian and looking for a book with lots of recipes... don't bother with this one. My advice: buy any book from the Moosewood restaurant (just type "Moosewood" in the book search, Amazon has most of them), they're huge, creative and delicious and the recipes are flawless.	negative
title: Excellent DVD [SEP] content: Excellent DVD. Recommend it for anyone who may be searching for some Biblical science answers.	positive
title: How wonderful [SEP] content: How wonderful that we can teach our children how to obediently live in a police state! This is a quick and effective way of indoctrination at an early, impressionable age.	positive
title: A Great Classic Movie [SEP] content: This movie was a good one, I liked how they put so much depth and detail into the characters and how the story flowed so well. The actors were great for their parts. Great movie for everyone!	positive
title: Let the subtle lies of antichrist be manifest by truth in the book! [SEP] content: The 1 star reply "antithesis's" are very against truth. It convicts them of sin they have (and we all who fell short too). She uses the infallible inerrant word of God, which is light, which does manifest the obvious subtle lies & persuasion of the tricks, used to deceive humans. It doesn't matter who thinks what! To expose the kind devices of the liar satan and his followers (which at one point I was and no longer am) (thank Jesus Christ) is going to continue. Many have tasted both sides of this issue and those who do seek truth make effort to inform others to warn them of the ripoff lies of the filthy murderous agenda that is underneath all spiritualism (that is not in perfect alignment with the truth of God). The dark shades of spiritualism is meant to steal, kill and destroy - period!I am glad she wrote this book.	positive
title: Couldn't do it [SEP] content: Okay so I think if a certain routine on a DVD requires the person buying it to have a specific item (let's say hand weights or a floor mat), that would be clearly advertised, right? Nope. I bought this because I always loved Paula Abdul's dance routines from the 80's and thought it would be fun. I put the DVD in only to be told I had to do the workouts on a hard floor. Um wow, could you not have mentioned that somewhere in the description? I have carpet in my den which is the only room with a TV that I can work out in. The moves don't work on carpet and you also need more room to move around (something else that's not mentioned) than what I had. Since I didn't actually get through this workout, I can't rate it on that per se, but I was disappointed that I wasted money for something I can't even do.	negative
title: Perfect solution. Keeps jacks from wearing out. [SEP] content: I use several different headphones, and plugging them in jacks over a period of time is bad. You'll break the pc input, the headphones themselves, or maybe even the wires.This reduces that with a press of a button.Perfect for workstations, or other situations where you'll be changing inputs throughout the day.Another interesting note is that you can double these up on each other. Stacking one media hub into the other and you get multiple buttons for different variations of inputs and sources. Not something everyone would need. But it works.	positive
title: Watershed at its best! [SEP] content: Watershed has solid songwriting, soulful lyrics and amazing vocals and musicianship! You won't be disappointed if you order this CD. An addictive album that you'll want to listen to over and over again. Perfect music for a road trip because of the musical journey that will parallel your own journey down the road. This is a great band!C. Norcross[..]	positive
title: Wonderful Book! [SEP] content: Marlfox is a great book. This is proboably one of Brian Jacques best. It is a mysterious and eerie book. If you love redwall you do'nt want to miss this one!!!	positive
title: Awesome [SEP] content: Wow I love these movies. We got them 2 weeks ago and we already watched 18 out of 42 dics. I would recomend these to anyone who like indians and good strong moral lessons.Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset,	positive
title: Complete piece of S#!% [SEP] content: I never bother to write a review, but I have to this time....Every caretaker who has to get into my Father's house to check on him HATES this box. I am suddenly unpopular because of the shoddy construction of this thing....To Whit:This lockbox is very difficult to open....a thin shim must be used to pry it open. (There is nothing to pull on).The numbers are very stiff, particularly in cold weather, so it is hard to get the combination lined up to begin with.Summary: Don't even think about it.	negative
title: disgraceful [SEP] content: It was bad enough when Crichton penned the misguided, xenophobic Rising Sun, but the dangers of global warming are so accute, the author has truly disgraced himself this time. Just this month New Scientist magazine published an article on the disappearance of the Carteret Islands, which are literally being swallowed by the rising sea. And this quack has the audacity to question the near-unanimity of the scientific community with his half-baked reactionary polemic. Why exactly does he think the 10 hottest years on record have been in the last 14 years?The very idea that global warming is some kind of mass movement is utterly preposterous. If Crichton spent any length of time around climatologists not in the employ of the oil industry, he would learn the difference between belief based on a mountain of evidence and paranoia.	negative
title: Compact and light [SEP] content: This butane powered lantern is very small and compact compared to other models, it doesnt weight much and you dont have to worry about breaking any glass. The only problem is that it provides about 60% of a mantle lantern light and is a bit more yellow. Also the light is more concentrated in a 180 degree radius because of the mirrors. However if you plan to camp for more than a couple of days, this is the best deal.	positive
title: takes too long [SEP] content: I don't know if the board has changed, but as a parent of a 4 year old, I hate playing this. The board is like a big grid and my son gets confused as to which way he's headed. The spaces have numbers on them, but even I have to look at which row I'm in and when he turns a corner he thinks he's supposed to go up. I do like that the slides and ladders have pictures of rewards or punishments. We have more fun talking about the pictures than moving our pieces. My last complaint is how long it takes to finish a game. I feel guilty not playing it more often, but we just don't enjoy it.	negative
title: Dumb [SEP] content: This movie would be a good reason for Amazon to offer the option of negative stars (black holes, perhaps?) in it's rating system. I gave it one star because it was the lowest they offer. You can count this movie's funny bits on one hand and still have enough digits left over (...) must surely be the result of some Hollywood Bigwig (Drew Barrymore perhaps?) losing a bet. The funniest thing was probably the animated Zebra guy's song and dance routine, which would have been a lot more enjoyable, if I hadn't been so thoroughly annoyed with the rest of the movie which alternated between being boring and really, really disgusting. Thanks, Tom Green, you certainly have more (...) than you claim to have.	negative
title: Save a tree, don't buy this book. [SEP] content: Tom Wolfe is a talented writer. But why he has to subject us to 650 pages of profanity is beyond me. He must have used the F-word at least 3-5 times per page. Save a tree and your money. Do not buy this book.	negative
title: Pretty pathetic [SEP] content: The singer is just full of himself amoung other things. The musicians think they're great but really are pretty mediocre. They could learn a few things by paying better attention to Rage. For rap, I'm sticking to Dre & Snoop Dogg.	negative
title: For all of us who feel estranged from (American) top-40. [SEP] content: It's sad, but typical; that MTV and popular radio have eschewed every one of this brilliant band's collective recordings. That's okay, they can have all the "Pretty Fly for A White Guy" and "Beep Beep who got da keys to da Jeep?" miserably uninteresting subhuman trash they want. As for the enlightened few who've had the pleasure of hearing this bands soaring music; please excuse us while we kiss the sky. I don't really understand the purpose of juxtapositioning Belle and Sabastion with the Smiths, insofar that there's no Johnny Marr clone to found here. And they really don't share Morrissey's self-loathing ruminations, lyrically. Their more akin, musically, to another British import that that failed at making a consequential impact on American shores. Faves: "Dirty dream number two" and the title track. Brilliant, did I mention brilliant?	positive
title: Product Pictured is not Product Delivered. [SEP] content: The well point pictured is a jet point, through which water is forced to actually remove dirt/sand around the well point as it is installed. In essence, it drills it's own hole. That is what the small holes pictured on the perimeter of the blue tip are for. The products delivered were well points with the solid tips (no water jet holes), designed to be installed in an already drilled hole. I called Grady's Online and left a message to that effect along with my contact information so that we could resolve the issue. They have not followed up. I also provided a response similar to this review to an Amazon email request for feedback. I have not been contacted by Amazon either, and the problem of the item pictured vs the item delivered remains. On the high side, the wrong product was delivered promptly.	negative
title: SONGS ARE CUT OFF! Get the CD instead! [SEP] content: The amazing music of the soundtrack deserves 5 stars, but the MP3 download version does not! Each track cuts out with a staticky sound right before the song is over. Bad encoding. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. GET THE CD INSTEAD.	negative
title: Oh The Lamb [SEP] content: I ordered 3 CD's. One of them skip, and I just read your return policies,and because a CD is downloadable, I cannot return it. I have ordered several CD's and books from you, and have always been satisfied. But this time one of the CD's is damaged. Of course it's opened, how else would I listen to it? I am very dissapointed, and will not make any more purchases. The CD is awesome. I would reccomend it to everyone. I just wouldn't recomment ordering it. Pay the extra $2.00 bucks and pick it upfrom your local store.	negative
title: THE book on Australian shepherds [SEP] content: If you want to know anything about Aussies, this is it. There are numerous books out there, but Mrs. Hartnagle-Taylor's is the book to have. While it is a little pricey, it contains everything you'll need. Grooming tips, first-aid, training, genetics, disease information, aussie specifics, chapters on aging, children, if you want to know it, AAA can tell you.	positive
title: Great DVD for younger children [SEP] content: This DVD has the fairy tale story for all of the main characters, as well as a few of the songs in the special features section. If you've never seen 'Super Why' before, it's a reading/educational cartoon that goes over sounding words out, the alphabet, spelling, and reading. Each episode starts out with one of the characters having a problem, and they go into a fairy tale that can help them solve it. The fairy tales are all altered to fit the episode, but the base of each tale is usually the same. At the end of the episode, they go over the problem again, and how to solve it, as well as a moral.The DVD also has some games and printable activities that you use, but I've never personally used that section.	positive
title: The company is good, but the product isn't. [SEP] content: I purchased this ice machine for our cottage. It worked great for 2 weeks. I called the company and they sent a new control panel. It is now a month later and the machine doesn't work again. I am very disappointed. I would never buy it again.	negative
title: Excellent little camera [SEP] content: This past June I picked this camera up deciding it was time to upgrade from my Powershot A520. The Optical Image Stabilization, DIGIC III, & Face detection features were big selling points for me. The camera takes really great photos, the Image Stabilization (IS) is worth the upgrade by itself. When you have the IS enabled the lens shifts to compensate for your hand shake, so your pictures come up much sharper and with little or no blur. The camera is easier enough for beginners to use but robust enough for advanced users to take advantage of certain features. With 7MP you can take and print out huge pictures and still retain all the details. The camera also takes really good video as well. There are many size options and even a 60fps option (320x240 @ 1min) Really helpful for catching fast moving things. Overall a fantastic camera and the IS is such a big help if you don't own a tripod or anything! I've included some sample photos as well.	positive
title: amazing cartoon [SEP] content: we cant get enough of this cartoon. It is fun for the whole family to watch. Children and adults can enjoy it. Shipping and quality of the disc are great as well. Thank you.	positive
title: Doesn't work [SEP] content: This cable did not work - there was a loose connection that caused loud static noise whenever it was jostled. As far as I'm concerned, a cable is either 1 or 5 stars, and this gets 1 since I had to replace it.	negative
title: Great read! [SEP] content: Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'	positive
title: I returned it [SEP] content: I registered for this because I liked the comfy fabric and everyone said you need a bouncy seat. Unfortunately, the seat is too upright and the vibrations were so mild that it did nothing for my baby. I am much happier with the ducky cradle swing!	negative
title: the spoken truth [SEP] content: maya angelou's even the stars look lonesome is an outburst to the african american society. it gives so much hope. her words express a lyrical emotion. her usage of intelligent voice structure titilates the mind.	positive
title: PROBLEMS WITH SHIPPING [SEP] content: I ordered the pods on Monday and it is now Friday night and the status has stated that it was "shipping soon" since Wed so it will not let me cancel the order! I still have no clue when this will really ship!	negative
title: he sells vitamins! [SEP] content: I didn't realize that he actually has a product line that he recommends in his book. This book is however a great resource and starting point in learning about what nutrients can help with depression. Fish oil and broccoli, baby!	positive
title: good stuff, but i like the electric version better [SEP] content: ...on the whole. mind you, some of the acoustic ones have beengrowing on me lately, so perhaps i'm in a transitional phase orsomething. anyway, while some of the other songs have better titles (luminous rose indeed!) or tunes, "sleeping with your devil mask" will always be my favorite song from this album. though perhaps a rerelease with the other version of GoF would change my tiny mind...	positive
title: Completely useless [SEP] content: It works for a while then it quits. It gets out of sync. I liked the idea of the remote button instead of installing more software / hotkeys. But it simply doesn't work reliably. And the delay on the USB is obnoxious - three to six seconds. I hope I can find the receipt.	negative
title: Let there be light! [SEP] content: Even without an owner's manual, anyone should be able to get this timer up and running in no time. I like the fact that (1) it sits on the table, making adjustments easier than the types that plug directly into the wall outlet and (2) it only takes the space of the plug at the wall - makes it easier to access both outlets.	positive
title: GREAT BOOK!!! [SEP] content: I think this book was great it kept you on the edge of your seat and was never boring. I love Dean Koontz books they are great!	positive
title: What Happened? [SEP] content: I was a huge Vertical fan and loved their music....but when i listened to EYW, I couldn't believe it was Vertical Horizon....did they go to Jackopierce school during their hiatus?...the songs are far from original (listen to Jackopierce's Finest Hour, which itself is another bad album), Matt's voice sounds more like a Backstreet Boy than his previous rich baritone, and the lyrics are honest, but too sing-songy.....How can one lose artistic integrity so fast....perhaps the money...needless to say, a huge disappointment.	negative
title: Not with Vista! [SEP] content: I am pretty sure that having Vista caused some problems, but I am not really sure. Technical Support was no help and even suggested I return it. Went with a Lynksis instead and it works a lot better and smoother.	negative
title: Product review [SEP] content: This watch was a gift for a friend of mine. It a cool watch and my friend was very pleased with it. It's so stylish that I bought other styles for myself.	positive
title: highly recommend [SEP] content: my first exposure to yoga was when my wife took me on a yoga journal cruise in the carribean about 10 years ago. loved the yoga and i loved the on-ship band, shatki fusion. my wife went on to become a practicing yoga teacher in lake st louis and i still do yoga myself. and we keep coming back to this cd. love it.	positive
title: Wont play on my machine [SEP] content: What a dissapointment that this Blu-Ray set wont play on my Pioneer (Model BDP-120) Blu-Ray disc player. All attempts to update the firmware have proven ineffective. Major Bummer!	negative
title: Me Too Book [SEP] content: Love the ME TOO Books for children. The author finds unique ways of expressing Biblical truths/telling Bible stories for children. Would certainly recommend Big Enemy, Bigger God!	positive
title: Not as advertised BEWARE [SEP] content: I received this item and it is not what is advertised. The box has a label affixed to the box stating it is 425F499G but it is not the 21,000 BTU model advertised it is a 14,000 BTU model. My invoice matches the label. BEWARE you will not get what is advertised here. Very disappointed.	negative
title: This one deserves a NEGATIVE rating. It blows, big time [SEP] content: This album is horrible. Period. Do not waste your money. It's the worst Warrant album ever. It was so bad that I gave my copy away, just to get it the heck away from my sight. This is a disgrace to the band and all their millions of fans. I bet Jani Lane wishes they could have this one back. A classic example of what happens when a once great band caves in to the whims of MTV and the music industry and tries to become alternative. The boys shoulda stuck to what made em great.	negative
title: Wonderful [SEP] content: Being a Gael the series was sweet and sour to me. The program itself is wonderful. Those who enjoy the good times and the bad in this glen full of many "characters" will appreciate this grand collection. The sour is that this scene is too real for many of us, with our own Clan Chiefs being raised in areas outside the West Highlands and Islands and not fully caring about those locals who choose a life in their family's home areas. The wonderful thing for me is that the "big house" is still a part of this non existent MacDonald family and Clan, and that poor Archie, with all his faults truly cares...the only soil my own Chiefs own today in Appin is the soil they are buried in and I think of it often. Cheers to you Archie.	positive
title: The battery die after 2 month [SEP] content: I bought two extended battery in different time frame. Both battery die after two month. There is no warrenty on the battery. I will not suggest you buy this product.	negative
title: Boring cliche "rock" [SEP] content: I'm just gonna say it... these guys ...I don't listen to them that much, but I've definently heard enough of their music to come to the conclusion that they are just another cliched "rock" band. The guys basically define mainstream; it's all here: predictable lyrics, basic riffs and stupid MTV music videos. These songs are boring as hell; they are all formulatic, predictable, and simple cliche. Take "Always" for example; this is seriously one of the worst "rock" songs I have heard in a LONG time. Every time I see the stupid video on MTV, I can't stop watching it because it litterally ... so much. Anyway, don't buy into this ... and go pick up a copy of Queens of the Stone Age, Rancid, Rage Against the Machine, etc.	negative
title: Just plain mediocre [SEP] content: Well I'm sorry, but there is nothing on this album that I havn't heard maybe 2 billion times before. Where on Earth is the creativity? What makes this band any better then the thousands of other mediocre bands that sound just like them? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. Sure these tunes are catchy, and will appeal to the young mainstream croud, but if you know anything about writing and composing music you will see how incredibly simplistic these songs are. Still, there is much worse out there, so I'll cut them a little slack and give them two stars.	negative
title: Amazon Cheats Customers [SEP] content: When I ordered these I noticed there were negative reviews regarding customers not getting what they ordered and payed for. However because Amazon continues to do business with this vendor and continues to stake their reputation on selling this product I thought I would take the chance and order these earrings.WRONG DECISION!!! DO NOT ORDER THESE EARRINGS!! DO NOT TRUST AMAZON!! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO ANOTHER STORE!!Amazon knows they have bad reviews and they know this vendor is cheating people and stealing their money and yet Amazon continues to do business with this crooked vendor and continues to help cheat consumers.Amazon SUCKS AND THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED!!!	negative
title: Way toooo long [SEP] content: I was eager to read this novel as many of my friends raved about this story. Unfortunately this novel didn't live up to my expectations. It read very slow in some areas, and some of the content was unbelieveable. I couldn't believe that Clair, portrayed by the author as this strong independent woman, would put up with as much as she did. She made time travel seem like a breeze. I didn't believe her character, or Jamie's virginity, was very credible. I finished the book, hoping the story would pick up, but was left frustrated and empty. The history was interesting, but not enough for me to recommend this book or read further about these characters. Do something better with your time.	negative
title: Helpful item, no so helpful company [SEP] content: Our son loved this swing initially-it was our last ditch effort to get him to sleep when he just can't be calmed down. Unfortunately, the mobile went out 2 weeks ago and the speed of the swing has slowed more everyday. I contacted Fischer Price 2 weeks ago and was told another motor would arrive in 10-14 days. Long story short, I have been told 3 different things by the company and have no hopes of a replacement motor within the next 2 weeks - more than a month later is terrible customer service - especially when babies change so quickly.I'm going to have to buy a new swing all together. Fisher Price treats their customers poorly!	negative
title: Only because of the music [SEP] content: The only reason I have not given this movie 5 points is the plot. However, the plot is a very minor component in this movie... This 1947 feature, shot inside Carnegie Hall is about a mother whose only dream is that her only son will become a famous concert pianist. As he grows up, he's fortunate enough to see the greatest names performing right across his home, at Carnegie Hall. The first 40 minutes focus on the plot and there's hardly any music in them. But then the direction changes - the plot moves to the backround while the focus is on Jascha Heifetz (1st movement from Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto), Artur Rubinstein (Chopin and De Falla), Jan Peerce, Rise Stevens and more. It's a unique chance to see these great names performing live! The picture and sound are, I guess, what can be expected from a movie made in the 40s not by a big Hollywood studio; nevertheless, if the artists and music in general are the focus, it's a treasure.	positive
title: Simply Awesome [SEP] content: Great product. Well worth the price. I have used mine with my subcompact digital camera for great landscape "night shots" where camera movement results in blurry images as well as "honeymoon" shots that aren't simply me holding the camera at arms length.	positive
title: First class read [SEP] content: Search for Significance by Robert McGee is the book I use most often in counseling next to the Bible. McGee focuses on four firmly held false beliefs shared by most people, and then explains that Jesus Christ has provided the answer for these lies that tend to dominate our lives. This book is a life changer.	positive
title: The Silver Surfer is happy [SEP] content: The Silver Surfer is happy and shocked. Did he fail to find the truth? Not quiet.	positive
title: Great cup of coffee -- fast and cheap! [SEP] content: I've had this coffeemaker for almost a year now and LOVE it. I bought it to use for my drive to work, but I now use it on non-workdays because it's quick and easy and makes great coffee. I love making only one cup but without the hassle of pods. I'm the only coffee drinker in my house, and my big coffeemaker has been put away now and only comes out when we're having company.A GREAT product!!	positive
title: BAD BAD BAD [SEP] content: This is such a boring book. Hill needs a lot more creativity. She's basically writing about nothing in this book. Everything is so redundant and the heroine becomes VERY irritable and annoying in this book. She panics over stupid little situations and loses every bit of her likeableness from the prequel Rebecca in this book. Those who read Rebecca, remember how we all felt some sort of pity for the girl? Or at least we didn't dislike her. But in this book, you just want to jump right into the book and slap her for her stupidity. And the ending, I don't know what else to say besides that its just plain STUPID. I can't believe I used so many "stupids" in a review, I've never done that before. Don't even think about buying this book. Use the money to buy any other book.	negative
title: Bought as a gift. [SEP] content: I resent being asked to write a required amount of words in order to submit a report on a purchase. I think just rating 1 through 5 stars is enough. Further more, if your rating system is not changed, it is highly likely that I will no longer be submitting a rating at all!	positive
title: Shipment not packed with sufficient dry ice [SEP] content: I wanted to surprise my Son in New York with Tom & Jerry mix from Wisconsin. This item comes from a company called WisconsinMade. When I ordered I was told it would be packed to last the week-end should my Son be away. I was told that it would be. Shipping was $26.00. It was room temp when he picked it up on Sunday night, and had to be destroyed. Wisconsinmade offers a "100% satisfaction guarantee", but all they would do was pick up the shipping charge and I would have to pay for the mix again. I would recommend that this item be ordered ONLY if you have absolute control of recipients time schedule.	negative
title: A Complete Waste of Time [SEP] content: I hadn't read anything about the book, and I just bought it on a whim. What a mistake! It was one of the worst books I've ever read. I like to indulge in trashy beach books once in a while - for instance,I loved Bridget Jones' Diary and About a Boy, even though neither could be considered particulary noteworthy in the world of great literature. But The Last Resort is just plain terrible. Lurie's writing style is one step above a Harlequin Romance. Her dialogue was inane, her characters trite and uni-dimensional, and the plot was totally uninteresting. I could not wait to finish it! I cannot believe this author ever won a Pulitzer Prize.	negative
title: POOR PORDUCT [SEP] content: I'M SORRY I BOUGHT THIS BRAUN TOOTHBRUSH, THE BATTERY DOES NOT HOLD THE CHARGE LIKE THE OLD ONE I HAD	negative
title: Loved it. [SEP] content: Great book and a fast easy read. I was sad when I finished it because I wanted to read more.	positive
title: Rubbish [SEP] content: I bought this poetry book from my local Borders, expecting a collection of stimulating and exciting poems. Much to my disappointment I found the most awful poetry imaginable intertwined with messages of hate and intolerance towards people of different faiths and races. The poetry lacked inspiration and did not read well i.e. it seemed to meander along in a monotone.I find it hard to fathom how such a poor collection of poems could be published. I can only assume that the poet is an amateur, who publishes his own work. The author would be well advised to embark upon a beginners poetry/writing course before producing any more books otherwise he will simply waste his own time and money.This book is certainly worth avoiding as it consists of very poor poetry with morally repugnant ideas.	negative
title: Junk for sale/short lifespan [SEP] content: Needed to get a portable a/c to install some trim on two rooms after some tornado damage. After getting the run around from some flakey contractors, I decided to go and do it myself. This compressor worked for this job and one other small job, and then the problems began, it couldn't pump up the presssure to get the control switch to shut off, why, because of internal leaks. The hotter these units get the aluminum heads warp, it's an inherant design flaw. I've not seen one of the compressors that utilize the oilless design that was worth a flip. They've all failed within 5 years of purchase, most only used sporadically. My last oil filled unit failed after 20 years of hard use, it's replacement has been on the job 7 years without issue. Meanwhile, I've burned up 2 other aluminum headed oilless units, of the shop size/vertical tank design at other farm operations I oversee. Don't waste your money on the the Porter Cable.	negative
title: Run, don't walk, away from Retrospect Backup [SEP] content: Retrospect is a terrible software application for the ordinary Mac or Windows user. Both versions are complex and difficult to use, and the interfaces are extremely unintuitive. To make matters worse, EMC will want to charge you $69 if you need help with this indecipherable mess. I only hope that the Time Machine backup feature that debuts with Mac's Leopard version of OS X will finally put this product out of business.	negative
title: POORLY CONSTRUCTED [SEP] content: I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD. THIS ITEM HADTHE PLUG PRONG BREAK OFF IN THE VERYFIRST OUTLET INWHICH I INSERTED IT IN INDIA.END OF STORY ...	negative
title: quilt [SEP] content: I have been following this particular artist since she first published her first quilt book. I enjoyed her other books and is a bit disappointed with this latest addition to her repertoire.	negative
title: A wonderful story [SEP] content: I can only add to the plaudits below. I didn't go to Navy, but my father and brother did. I've always wondered if plebe year was as wierd and hard and fascinating as they said it was -- now I know the answer. But beyond the wonderful introduction to USNA life, this is a terrific story -- great, complex characters, inspiration as well as sardonic humor, and a terrific twist at the end. Anyone who is interested in military life will enjoy this book. I'm about to buy several copies to send to friends.	positive
title: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME [SEP] content: I thought this movie was terrible. I really liked Wrong Turn but this was completely different. VERY BORING! Not recommended!!!	negative
title: The Donkey's Dream [SEP] content: The Donkey's Dream gives an unique veiw of the christmas story. One sees what the donkey carrying Mary must have been feeling. It promotes imagination and it has great pictures for younger children.	positive
title: Classic? Not in my book... [SEP] content: The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane, for me, was not entertaining. I found myself lost in most parts of the book. Crane is a very talented writer, he is very descriptive in his works, but I just do not prefer his writing style. If you prefer hemmingway-straight and to the point, you won't enjoy Crane's writing. Stephen Crane spends a lot more slower pace on his point making. Usualy taking a page to explain one thing. Another interested fact that I saw in Crane's writing was that he doesn't name specificly his characters. Instead he will use a characteristic that they will go by through the whole book. Again, I thought this book was very boring, and found my self drifting away from it. Hope this helps.	negative
title: Why are people dissing this game??? [SEP] content: This is a great survival horror game. Though it isn't if you are looking for a game where you fill bad guys full of lead. This is like reident evil 3 nemesis, cept without the guns. You basically solve puzzles, watch amazing cutscenes, and run away from bad guys. There are boss battles where you use " Magical Arrows " to kill the boss. But dont think this is a bad game just because of the lack of combat, unless you love combat. If you are a guy looking for good graphics, awsome cutscenes, good story, fun and strategic gameplay, and a game that is scary as hell. Then get this. But if you like the fighting then dont, well still give it a try.	positive
title: What a disappointment [SEP] content: I was looking forward to this cd for a long time. As with all the Saves The Day cds, I bought it without even hearing a song. Their previous efforts are just amazing. But his is such a disappointment. What the heck happened to their sound. Simply put this cd is Stay What You are with VERY few catchy hooks and a very irritating sound. The STD that I loved is quickly becoming a memory. If you are new to Saves The Day, buy Can't Slow Down or Through Being Cool, those are the cds that made STD into the great band that they were. I hope Chris will realize that and go back to those days.	negative
title: Lotta fun! [SEP] content: I wouldn't compare this to the original songs, they are different and are intended to be. I have to say, a thrill went up my spine as I popped this CD in. The Techno beat is a lot of fun and makes me want to dance. How many CD's can you say that for?	positive
title: just terrible [SEP] content: I love Varley. His Titan trilogy stands as one of the finest works in all SF. That's why this is --so-- disappointing. As others have pointed out, this is vaguely reminiscent of Heinlein's juvenile SF, but it is not nearly as good. This isn't appropriate for juveniles and I don't even think they would find it interesting. The first half of the book is about the variously messed up lives of some uninteresting teenagers. The character development is poor, the dialog is wooden. The "washed up ex-astronaut" and the events that led to his disgrace are implausible and the "character" is very poorly developed. The novel is supposed to be filled with coon-ass cajuns from south Lousiana. Well, I grew up in New Orleans, and these characters are completely hollow, with no authenticity.I can't recommend this book at all. Read Titan/Wizard/Demon or the short fiction by this author, but this book is one to avoid.	negative
title: troy built [SEP] content: I filled it with gas/oil mix and it started right up out of the box. Very happy with the performance so far. For me, any 2 stoke comes a little later when it's "inherent" issues can come to light.	positive
title: Dude's great on CD and AMAZING Live [SEP] content: EVen more than buying the CD, ya wanna see this guy live. He's been playing in NYC for a while, and i've caught a few of his shows. He is one of the most electrifying performers i've seen. He is a band by himself--playing guitar and also using it as percussion, blowing through his lips to play trombone..i know it sounds somewhat lame, BUT he pulls it off, even for this cynical concert-going New Yorker. I say get the CD, and do your best to catch his show whenever he's in your town.	positive
title: Hot and heavy in New Orleans. [SEP] content: This is a good Nick Cage movie. It wasn't a big hit. Some might not like and find it crap. Its not so there!	positive
title: wonderful project [SEP] content: this is a wonderful project.im from n.y and i know good music when i hear it and this is truly GOOD.this is a cd that you can listen all the way through.i did not have to skip any songs.my favorite song is I.P song "I DONT HAVE TO WORRY NO MORE AND SAVED" BY OWEN FORBESJOB WELL DONE A.V	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: I got this product for my birthday. I expected the baby penguin to be at least 5"or 4" tall, instead it was 3.5". It can fit in my palm. The Mom is a foot tall. They are very easy to cut apart the baby from the Mom. They are: soft, realistic, cuddly and well made.Over all I will give it five stars. [ I am 9]	positive
title: nice basic every day watch [SEP] content: I bought this watch two or more years ago and have worn it almost every day. I've had to replace the battery once. The face of the watch became quickly quite scratched (disappointing), but otherwise it has held up well and works nicely both with casual and professional clothing.	positive
title: Awesome Book [SEP] content: Technical books tend to bore me to death but I managed to worked my way through this one. The author didn't write it in typical egghead-ese that one might see with any book focused on a such a complex arena of computing. I learned quite a few concepts with this one.I purchased the book primarily based on the ratings here and want to thank the other reviewers. They were right on with their reviews. This one is a must-read if you're even remotely interested in network security.	positive
title: Excellent Text [SEP] content: I used many resources to pass the ACRC Exam. This text stands out as the best by far. I found myself going back to it again and again. If you have a network you can work on and this book by your side, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't pass the test on the first try (but you MUST know this book inside and out).	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: These are probably the best headphones of this type for the money. I would have given them five stars if the cord was just a little bit longer.	positive
title: 0 Stars for CHEESEHEAD REX [SEP] content: This film is 100% trash,just look at this stupid Irish film. The character Rex look like a kids toy,and whats with all the use of claymation. Terrible movie form start to finish and grainy picture quality make this movie worthless. Even Pumpkinhead looked more realistic than this which isn't saying much. I would say skip this cheesy trash and get a horror movie not a horrible movie.	negative
title: sharply biased documentary [SEP] content: I am a muslim, and have not seen such a one-sided documentary about islam before. More than the negative comments of the scholars, the lack of opposite scholars is disturbing. They colected scholars that are all on the one side, and all of them without an exception have either misunderstood the message of Quran and the prophet or they intentionally divert the message. It would be more convincing if they have brought at least one scholar that could answer the allegations. They sometimes take a verse, without referring to the context of it, skipping the previous two verses that is essential in understanding it. If you have prejudices about islam and want to reinforce them, buy, otherwise buy something at least more objective.	negative
title: Huge disappointment [SEP] content: This game started out with an interesting story line, then I continued to play and had flashbacks of the original Resident Evil. The battle field was a joke and the enemies were rather unoriginal. The weapons broke every five seconds and were we. The only aspect of this game that I thought had a gleam of originality was the weapon effects on status. All and all this game was a disappointment to Atari.	negative
title: Powerful and thought-provoking. [SEP] content: This could be the best book I have ever read. It ignited my passion for history. I found myself wrapped up in it, unable to stop thinking about it. It didn't talk about the politics, it just talked about the truth--How the grunts dealt with life and the emotional and physical toll it took on them. My fasination with war is only increased after reading this book. I can't wait to read more books about Vietnam.	positive
title: The Essential Offspring Album! [SEP] content: When I first heard The Offspring, it was the horrible pop abomination Americana. However, at the time I liked it, and that led to me buying some of their other CD's, and I found out how much they really ROCK! Ixnay on the Hombre is cool, and the new album is alright, but this is the album to buy. The music is still somewhat unrefined (in a good way), and the band hasn't started to become poppy yet. This isn't "Pretty Fly", this is real punk-rock/alternative. If you even remotely like the band, I will tell you now: YOU NEED THIS CD. Buy it, now. Don't finish reading this review, just buy it. You have my stamp of approval. Every song is cool, especially "Gotta Get Away", "Bad Habit", "Self Esteem", and "Smash". But they all are really cool, so it doesn't matter which ones I like. A must-have, plain and simple.	positive
title: No extras [SEP] content: Film was ok but you don't get and extras, so I'd suggest buying the dvd unless you need to watch this instant. It is a better value...	negative
title: Short and Sweet [SEP] content: Sure, if you're familiar with history you know how it's going to end before you even open it, but Miller's writing and incredible art are well worth it. This large hardcover is a perfect coffee table book after the initial read through, plus you can impress your friends by having the source material on your table long before the movie based on it comes out in March.Short graphic novel, story and writing are good, art is amazing.	positive
title: Poorly made - waste of money [SEP] content: While cutting down the first and only branch the bands that old the rope closed on each end of the chain saw and the one that holds the loop for the bag all broke along with one of the handles at the end of the chain saw. Poorly made if it cannot even cut one branch before falling apart.	negative
title: it stinks [SEP] content: prompt delivery and i got what i ordered. what i didnt exspect was the awful chemical smell. i have had it hanging outside for a month and it still reeks. I wont be able to use it for a deer blind. because the deer will smell it from the next county.	negative
title: Boring [SEP] content: Attorney Paul Madriani is back in another legal thriller by Steve Martini. This time Paul takes on the case of Emiliano Ruiz, an ex-military man who now does security work. Unfortunately, Ruiz had the misfotunate to be doing security work for murder victim, Madelyn Chapman. Chapman ran a software company heavily involved with government contracts. Not only did Ruiz do security work for Chapman, but he also had an affair with her before she unceremoniously dumped him. Ruiz has a ready-made motive of revenge and jealousy.The book started out promising, but quickly turned disappointing. The whole middle of the story just dragged until I found myself starting to skim...not a good sign. I've never really enjoyed government corruption stories. They tend to lend themselves to cliches and this one is no exception. I do like Paul Madriani as a character and I hope the next book has a better plotline.	negative
title: Good, but not good enough [SEP] content: I found the Idiot's guide to San Francisco to have good information on places to visit and things to see, but it could have been better if it included more accurate transportation information. My advice would be to scan this book in the store for a few clues on places to go, but save your money for a book that will better help you arrive at your destination.	negative
title: The First Book of Tenor Solos [SEP] content: It was requester by my music instructor, I like the book because it is good for starters. I enjoy this book.	positive
title: not so great [SEP] content: i bought it for "popular," as did many people, and i was dissapointed in it. a lot. they jumped on the comet tail of grunge and are nowhere near as spectacular as the original. the only redeemable song on the album is "zen brain," the closing track. that song has a lot of emotion put into it and seems much more heartfelt than the rest of the album.	negative
title: Great looks -- terrible smell! [SEP] content: I was thrilled with how this product looked, and ignored the negative reviews. When used, however, urine can get between the product and the top of the toilet bowl and there's no way to clean that without removing it. And so it stinks.Might be OK on an elongated seat, or if the user isn't male. It just doesn't work for men on an standard (non-elongated) toilet.	negative
title: Clap Trap Nonsense [SEP] content: Picked up this book and had to ask myself, what truth? Then I heard its author, Glenn Smith, on the radio today being interviewed. If everyone someone had an agenda it was that man. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this bit of political back stabbing, photocopied bit of nothing.	negative
title: to big for baby [SEP] content: For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine. I don't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag. Could not continue use of product.	negative
title: cant believe something so simple isn't reliable [SEP] content: When this converter arrived I plugged it in and the system (Vista Ultimate 64 bit using Linksys 4 port KVM switch) recognized it and installed the drivers. So far so good. The mouse didn't respond smoothly and hesitated and began generating random button presses (both left button and right) while moving across the screen. I went out and bought a Belkin converter from Staples ($35). That works fine.This is the first product I've had to return to Amazon.After looking around the web for a while it seems that USB/PS2 converters are pretty iffy. Doesn't seem to matter whether you buy the cheapest one or the most expensive, some just work and some just don't. Wish I could tell you how to pick one that will work on your system, but it looks like it will be trial and error.	negative
title: Prescription for Herbal Healing [SEP] content: An indispensible reference book for looking up symptoms and ailments with clear accounts of what is the best help, good help, and also what is helpful. Very specific about what to do for ailments. Thorough and easy to understand. Great to have on hand 24/7.	positive
title: HP Auto Sense ruins this paper [SEP] content: The paper itself is great but HP has a new feature called Auto Sense. This is a small barcode on all 4 corners on the underside of the paper. But when they packaged the paper, the ink on the bar code wasn't dry yet so the barcode ink has dried on the print-side of the next sheet in the pack. After printing you can still clearly see these marks because the printer ink doesn't stick to the already dried bar-code ink. The marks are especially visible if the corner of your photo is one color, like the sky.And on Premium Plus photo paper at 0.70 per sheet I'd expect better.I'm returning mine.	negative
title: IT KNOCKED ME DEAD [SEP] content: This is a must have for any dead fan it has everything anyone could want the extra live versions on all the albums are greatThis shows the dead at their best.Garcia's guitar work is amazing and i love his banjo on workingman's dead	positive
title: Most Annoying Golf Video [SEP] content: This video is unwatchable. I bought this video because of all the positive reviews. If you want to hear an annoying Boston accent mixed with karate mixed with golf then go ahead and waste your money. If you want to spend your money wisely then just go get a lesson. A lesson from a pro will be more effective and efficient then some video comparing golf to karate.	negative
title: This unit does not work! [SEP] content: This is the 2nd time I have tried this product (out of desperation). The first time I tried it with my two pug-mixed dogs it worked the first day (with one) and then not again after. I thought maybe something was wrong with the unit, so I took it back. Got another unit and am trying again now. Same story. The first day one of my dogs seemed to bark a bit less, but after that, both dogs just ignore it. This morning they literally woke us up barking -- it's like it's not even there. Back to the store it goes. Again. I need to find something else. :(	negative

title: How can an honest person believe this junk, please... [SEP] content: ...consult a historian quickly. Not only that, but how can someone publish such lies. Even the Protestants I run into are embarrassed to see this book in their stores."To be deep in history is to cease to be Protestant." - (Anti-Catholic Anglican Priest John Henry Neumann after converting to Catholicism.)Please, anyone out there, study with an honest mind. Read both sides of the argument. You can contact me @ timobrien78@hotmail.com and I can give you recommendations of books that easily refute this garbage.Yours in Christ,Tim O'Brien	negative
title: TRASH!!! [SEP] content: I bought a comp with windows me on it and tried to use nortons anit-virus 2002 without realizing it has an in compatability problem, now my whole hard drive is fried!! THANK YOU MICROSOFT!!!if you can avoid it, do it.	negative
title: Stereotypical, Self-Congratulatory TRIPE [SEP] content: Steven Levenkron's book "The Best Little Girl in the World" is ridiculous and stereotypical. All it does is present the perfect little white ballerina from a well-off family and belittle the class she 'represents'. Levenkron assumes the role of Kessa's terrific therapist but i think he needs therapy himself!This book is nothing but fuel for a dangerous obsession. As so many other reviewers have said, it GLORIFIES anorexia. The chants of "Kessa, Kessa, Kessa" give the reader a chance to develop an eating disorder themselves.The sequel to this book, "Kessa" is just as bad as this book. Unless you are VERY secure about your self-image, do NOT under any circumstances read this book! In fact, even if you are secure, don't read it. It's nothing but self-congratulatory TRIPE.	negative
title: Ok, but some flaws [SEP] content: I guess the bottom line is that it does do the job, but...150 foot range? Not with a hurricane at its back. With brand new batteries, mine is a bit inconsistent at 25' line of site or 10' through an interior wall. Also, you can't disable that loud voice. When I'm cooking a 5 lb roast beef, I don't want her yelling "YOUR FOOD IS ALMOST READY!!! YOUR FOOD IS ALMOST READY!!!" when it's 10 degrees under the target temperature. I slow cook, and that means I still have a good half hour to go. I'd prefer a nice old fashioned beep.Also, it seems that if it doesn't get a signal for a while, it simply stops updating and the temperature changes to "---" without any audible warning. Now you've got to go back through the startup routine to find out what the current temperature is.	negative
title: Worst Batman I've ever seen [SEP] content: This is just a collection of random Batman cartoons. First off the animation is just horrible. Second, have the people who made these episodes ever even read a Batman comic. The stories are pitiful. The art in some of the episodes is passable, but mostly it just annoys. The first episode being the worst drawing I think I've ever seen, Ren & Stimpy was better done. If I go on any longer my review will seem like some hate-filled rant so I'm going to stop now. Trust me and DO NOT BUY this. Re-watching any episode from Batman: The Animated Series (Batman TAS) is better than seeing this for the first time.	negative
title: Rave reviews??? [SEP] content: Someone asked, "Why all the rave reviews?" Because no critic had the courage to offer less than rave. Critics are cult members and they must remain loyal to the cult.About the book: unnecessarily disjointed and confusing, self-indulgent, but an interesting commentary on the state of post-modern religion.	negative
title: Thank you Grisham for taking this injustice [SEP] content: John Grisham chose a compelling story to feature in his true crime book about Ron Williamson's scandalous treatment at the hands of Ada, Oklahoma police and prosecutors. It's too bad the book is not quite as great a read as it is an important and empathetic discussion of justice gone awry. Now I understand he's signed onto a movie deal for the book, a film that I'll no doubt rush out to see. Grisham may write better when he relies on his imagination rather than the record, but I'm truly thankful that he made the effort to write this book and I'm pleased he's apparently gone on to help the unfortunate soul who was convicted with Williamson, Dennis Fritz, sell his own book about the experience. Don't give up on the true crime genre John. You'll get even better at it.	positive
title: The new Earth [SEP] content: I thought this book was very difficult to read and wondered what all the fuss is about. It had some good points, but a lot of it was just filler.	negative

title: Here is why some cosmetics work, and some don't [SEP] content: Ms. Begoun does not just tell us which products are good, she tells why. I enjoyed finding which drug-store products were better than the department store products, and actually buying them, and discovering they were great! It's nice to have a guide for cosmetics. When I can't return cosmetics, I'd like to know what it is I'm spending all my money on and if it will really work. I do it for cars and other major purchases; why not for my face? I checked this book out of the library several times before I finally broke down and bought it. I do not regret a moment of it	positive
title: The Definitive Book on Valuing Players [SEP] content: For those of you that have wrestled with the issue of dollar values, position scarcity and valuing a player's future value in preparation for your rotisserie draft, this book is for you. McGee outlines a step-by-step method to set up his insightful valuation method in a spreadsheet. It really makes sense and it works too! I have been using the McGee method for the past two seasons and it has noticeably improved my draft performance. With all the information readily available to fellow owners it is much more difficult to find an edge at draft day. My spreadsheet gives me that edge.It took me an hour or two to set up the spreadsheet the first year, but since then, I just plug and play.	positive
title: Stargirl review by ruby [SEP] content: If you are looking for a thoroughly depressing book about the evils of high school social classes, look no further. You have found Stargirl, a freshman who dares to defy the normal order of her high school and goes out of her way to be nice to people. Everyone in Stargirl's high school, besides her boyfriend Leo, and her friend Dori, hates her. The story is told by Leo, who makes Stargirl sound so hopeless and pathetic that you'll want to rip the book to pieces. Although it is a fictional story, no "higher class" student treats their peers like the dirt they make Stargirl out to be. Incredibly dull and dreary, Stargirl is filled with boring details and similes that leave you depressed and unhappy. This is one book to leave at home.	negative
