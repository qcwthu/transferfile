title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: Not exactly for dummies [SEP] content: I bought this book after purchasing another book on Frontpage that was way over my head. I bought it thinking that it would be basic enough to begin to learn how to use Frontpage but it is not. It is similar to the other book describing features of Frontpage that I do not understand. I have used other "Dummies" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that "it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage.	negative
title: Fell Apart in Less Than 60 Days [SEP] content: I have had good luck with this product in the past, but the latest one tore apart at one of the seams. It was used for maybe 50 hours of exercise. Because Amazon does not allow returns after 30 days, I am out of luck, and out $12.	negative
title: Not too great... [SEP] content: We bought this cord to plug into our Sony car stereo so we could listen to our MP3 players over the car stereo system. The cord doesn't make a very good connection, and frequently has to be jiggled to get both channels of sound. It is very annoying. I would recommend getting a more expensive cable if you want good, consistent sound quality.	negative
title: Uber Aweful! No Flavor Here... [SEP] content: When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped.	negative
title: Why? [SEP] content: I am personally tired of all the "Women are wonderful, Men are horrible" rhetoric, sheist. This movie is a complete waste of time, and plastic used to make the DVD. Ask an honest question. If men are dogs, what are you calling his parents, in particular, his mother?I'undi.	negative
title: Context is everything [SEP] content: I read this book before Frey revealed that it was fiction, and kept thinking, there is no way that this could be true. It did hold my attention, but in that "truth is stranger than fiction" way. Once you know that it really isn't true, its just a badly written and improbable tale made up by an idiot.	negative
title: Calphalon Convenience but Poor Baking Results [SEP] content: After several weeks of use, I've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges. This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets don't seem to allow for any workaround, i.e. lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon, they clean up very easily but what's the point if you can't trust them with your food in the first place?PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of "surprise" burnt items.	negative
title: John's Gone Hollywood! [SEP] content: The Street Lawyer is a disappointing LITTLE book that reads, to me, more like a 90-minute, cookie-cutter movie script and not the full-length, page-turning novel I'd expect from someone capable of A Time to Kill or The Partner. The opinions expressed by the author appeared long ago in The Communist Manifesto, there's no character development, and the loose ends left in end are too numerous to mention.If you can't wait for a copy at the library, at least wait for the paperback.	negative
title: When everything is just average... [SEP] content: Compared to HITNF, Q2k & Tribe, this must be their best album so far, but if you just listened to the complexity of OM I, the sad beauty of Promised Land, the energy of Warning, or the divine tech-metal of Rage for Order, even the more commercial Empire, you will be sadly dissapointed. Do yourself a favour, check out Pain of Salvation, or Evergrey... Maybe Wolverine?	negative
title: Nothing comparable to the Aztec [SEP] content: It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.	negative
title: What are these other reviews? [SEP] content: This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller.	negative
title: You Can Do Better... [SEP] content: I bought this book along with another book for baby shower decoration ideas. Boy, was I disappointed. The book is boring and the ideas are not at all original. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one.Now, if you want a really good book with great ideas, try "Themed Baby Showers: Mother Goose to Noah's Ark" by Becky Long. It's an excellent book with excellent, original ideas.	negative
title: Badly written [SEP] content: The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable.	negative
title: Disappointing..... [SEP] content: I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: seam ripped after only a few days & couldn't be fixed [SEP] content: My kids were so excited to get this last Christmas. I read the reviews,but purchased anyway hoping that if we were really careful, things would be different for us. My kids are small (20, 30 and 35 pounds, when we purchased this) and they were super careful in the ballpit. (All shoes, hair clips, and accessories came off before going in) They treated it as gently as they possibly could. Unfortunately, it ripped along a seam within the first month. We made several attempts to fix it, but it continued to get small rips in different places along the seam and never held air again. So disappointing. It's seriously just a poorly made product.	negative
title: UNrealistic [SEP] content: While parts of this book make for a good read, it is hard to believe that such a spastic person has everything work out for just in time to write a book. If you must read this, skip the	negative
title: these guys ripped me off! [SEP] content: I purchased a box of 12 Uniball pens, I even showed the listing to friends to make sure that the add was for 12 pens and not one. But they shipped me one pen, and charged me 6.99 shipping to boot! I refused the shipment, as per my postal carrier's instructions, and tried to contact the company, but they never even tried to get back to me. So, lesson learned.	negative
title: i dont want part of a differential equation, i want all of it [SEP] content: chapter one is all it took for me. no worked out examples. chapter one explains the thoery and what is happening with the heat equation but the problems at the end of the chapter have answers which the text did not tell you how to get. either way, a partial differential equations class requires lots of studying but i recommend not using this book.	negative
title: pants are dragging [SEP] content: Will not shop with this vendor again. I ordered 2 pair of jeans. After washing them to shrink, they were still 3 inches too long. CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size. I'm a guy, I build houses but can't sew, so now I have to pay a seamstress. Vendor sucks, but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano.	negative
title: Not so pleased [SEP] content: Blurry on the edges, heavy once connected to a 50mm, realy a cheap fish eye alternative that will deliver just that, mediocre results	negative

title: Revelations ?? Hardly !! [SEP] content: It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said " The never before told story" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other "authors" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion.	negative
title: Gave it away just to get rid of it. [SEP] content: Bought it as an after-thought with another sexy DVD, which I liked very much. Good actors on this one, so expected better. After seeing it, I told my husband to just drop it in the garbage, he suggested we give it to a friend who will watch anything. Except for a couple funny lines, I thought it was a total waste of my time. Mary	negative
title: This stuff is garbage [SEP] content: DO NOT, under any circumstances buy this RAM.PC133 SDRAM. How basic can you get? According to the specifications, it should have had no trouble working in our computer. Well this stuff is junk. Had to put the old RAM back in to get the machine to boot up, and now off to find something reliable.	negative
title: Not her best work. [SEP] content: I was somewhat disappointed in this one, and I have enjoyed Hunter's previous writings. Petty as it seems, I was distracted and annoyed with the silliness of the verbiage used by the main character as a substitute for "cuss words". I could have read right on through normal profanity and enjoyed the story a little more.	negative
title: Call it InterDev for Dummies [SEP] content: The Mastering Series is poor book for mastering ASP. Consider it a basic help file with some simple examples. To learn ASP and InterDev, get the Wrox book. Microsoft Press should be embarassed putting out this material.	negative
title: Way Out There [SEP] content: I admit to being sucked in by this one. But, after spending part of an evening reading it (it is a quick read), I was rather miffed by the ending, which was really implausible. The DaVinci Code has a much better ending.	negative
title: cute but small, not worth the price [SEP] content: This looks big in the picture trust me it is samll. Appears open in the back for alot of utensils, but the opening cannot hold more than 5 untensils.	negative
title: C:13:00 Error Club [SEP] content: Sony DVP S560D - DVD player - blackDVP S560D, Worked Great until I joined the C:13:00 Error Club, Google "Sony C:13:00" to find out more.	negative
title: Being generous with ONE star [SEP] content: OMG....I felt as though the book did not break down the enormous amount of info on the different strategies. SMH	negative
title: Portable [SEP] content: I love the portability of this new Interplak. I've been using their products for over 15 years and was able to easily take it with me on a recent trip.	positive
title: A nice change of pace. [SEP] content: This is by no means a strong tea, it was not meant to be. The flavor is great. I normally make my tea from scratch but have these around when I am on the run. The price is very reasonable and I will certainly be purchasing more. For something a bit different, I certainly recommend you give this tea a try.	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: It's that good [SEP] content: This book is so good you will stop reading it less than half-way through so you can start experiencing the NOW that it describes so well.	positive
title: This lady sings the Blues! [SEP] content: Shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. I first got "Wicked" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. When I got Turn the Heat Up, her earlier Cd, I was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, R&B , all around blues. Shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! Congratulations on your Handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you Shemekia! I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come.	positive
title: wanda the whale [SEP] content: It works great just alittle slower than doing it your self.But it is great too have helps alot very easy too use not hard too put it together great little thing too have if you have a pool	positive
title: Corrs at there best and Great quality [SEP] content: I am a huge Corrs fan, and have every album and DVD they have ever put out. I strongly believe that there first two albums are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music.	positive
title: Great Bargain!! [SEP] content: I also bought the Sylvania DVC860D DVD & VCR combo as a replacement for a cheap "Monkey Wards" VCR I bought 8yrs. ago for a much greater price than this unit. What a great Christmas buy at $99.99! It works great in re-running VHS Tapes out of my library and has played all the DVD's I have burnt with my new Plextor 708A DVD Burner.Also, this unit even hooked up to my 14yr. old TV using RF cables: how about that! This product does it all that they say it will, and is a fantastic bargain. I truly recommend this product to all. Remember, just because it cost more doesn't mean its better!!	positive
title: The best book in the world!!!!!!! 5/9/1999! [SEP] content: This book is very interesting. I just got it today from amazon.com. Have you read the part about the youngest married couple or the longest fingernails or even the biggest tumor?! I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for something to read that is exciting and facinating.!	positive
title: Love this Camera [SEP] content: So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on.	positive
title: BAY AREA MACK DOWN [SEP] content: TAKE THIS ALBUM FOR WHAT IT IS. IT IS THE PIMPS EARLY BOOTLEG, BAY AREA UNDERGROUND, RAP. OLD BEATS WITH BETTER THAN AVERAGE RHYMES. BUT IF YOU LOVE TOO $HORT, YOU NEED TO OWN IT...	positive
title: Outstanding [SEP] content: Probably the finest expose written detailing the forgotten history and law behind the way our country used to view military operations and service. Much of today's understanding, regarding the military establishment and our government's use of it, is a recent development. Up until the Korean war, the military was under the exclusive direction of the Congress; but this book shows how the Executive branch has usurped Congress's authority with the public's knowledge and acquiescence.	positive
title: The Pushcart War! [SEP] content: This was one of the greatest books i read as a child! I loved the characters of the pushcart king, old anna, and wanda gambling. this is a great book for anyone who just likes stories that could be real, could have happened-but didn't. It's a sweet story and it can be enjoyed by kids 5 to 50. I would recommend this book to anyone. BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!	positive
title: why you should add this CD to your collection [SEP] content: I just returned (Wednesday, Sept. 29), from one of the most brilliant concerts I have ever witnessed! As per usual, most of us "oldies" wanted to hear the old stuff, Aqualung, etc., but I found the new CD, and the cuts he played live to be outstanding. It's definatly worth the price, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for oldies, buy one of the earlier outings. This one's a keeper.	positive
title: Another winner in this series [SEP] content: I am a big fan of Shirley McClintock and her family. I've read every one as soon as I could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times I'm afraid I will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. Shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed "heroine" that clutter too many mysteries. The mysteries are clever and beguiling but it is the the people in the books I want to know more about. They are real, flawed, full flavored, and interesting. My only complaint is that Ms Oliphant cannot, under the present law, be forced to write more, more, more.	positive
title: Farmer Fan [SEP] content: This quilting book was exceptional. It was very detailed and easy to understand. I was impressed with the variety of farm quilts. They showed great detail. I liked the variety of colors that were used. My daughter loves the Denim and Bow Tie Quilt. She plans on decorating her daughters room in some type of country theme and this is a great bedspread for a girl. The pockets add alot of character. The techniques of this book were well explained for the beginner to the more advanced quilter. This book will be a great book for your quilting collection.	positive
title: Heartbreaker [SEP] content: Exciting and fast paced. I must admit I had identified the wrong villan. The plot is amusing in places when Nick's emotions for Laurent become so conflicted. A good read.	positive
title: Excellent, Excellent, Excellent [SEP] content: BOOT CAMP is absolutely the best SAT preparation book I have ever seen. Mrs. Manning's style of writing in BOOT CAMP is captivating. She writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. Her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. All sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. When you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. Mrs. Manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the SAT. If you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your SAT score at the same time, buy BOOT CAMP now. You will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.	positive
title: Thoroughly engrossing! Historical Fiction fans must read. [SEP] content: For me, Noah Gordon has created a "time machine" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a "touched" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!	positive
title: EXCELLENT BOOK [SEP] content: THIS IS THE BEST AND THE ONLY BOOK TO EXCEL IN TEA EXAM. I SAT FOR IRS TEA EXAM ON 03/09/07 AND I MUST SAY THAT PART A & B WERE MUCH EAIER THAN THIS BOOK. MATHEMATHICAL SECTION IS ABSENT IN IRS TEA EXAM.IF YOU CAN SCORE 70% ON THIS BOOK, ITS MUCH LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD SCORE OVER 80% ON THE ACTUAL TEST.	positive
title: where to get book [SEP] content: I got the book by calling 954 597 9922. The book was a great help in understanding the deliberate lies of the Nation of Hate otherwise called the Nation of Islam. Trager destroys their arguments and shows the true authors of the slave trade, the Nation of Islam's fellow Muslims. Of course, Farrakhan and company deliberately ignore that fact.	positive
title: Post "Twice Removed" masterpiece [SEP] content: This album is pure pop! Every song is so catchy that a person who likes Heavy Metal will actually sing to this. Almost as good as Twice Removed! SLOAN ROCKS!!!!	positive
title: Good works [SEP] content: I heard about this book at a seminar and on ordering this used copy, have not been disappointed. It is a great joy to find this used volume of a deceased author, and I thank you so much for sending it so quickly. This is a volume to keep in the family!	positive
title: Rankin & Bass Do King Kong [SEP] content: Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out.	positive
title: Fans of the show will love the soundtrack! [SEP] content: If you like the show Charmed, then you'll <u>love</u> the Charmed Book of Shadows Soundtrack.It really sets a charming mood. This soundtrack is a wonderful mix of different music that any fan of the show will love.	positive
title: Takes stress out of dinner [SEP] content: This book has taken stress out of dinner. however, I use it more as a guideline because the recipes are not exactly healthy. I definitely subsitute.	positive
title: Very nice, and a good value for money [SEP] content: I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra	positive
title: Pizza Tiger [SEP] content: If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio	positive
title: Good Introduction to Parallel Programming with MPI [SEP] content: This book is a great introduction to the theory of parallel programming. It is important to note that it is not a great reference for MPI, but it does a good job introducing the basic MPI functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.If you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. If you are looking for an MPI reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced MPI use, look elsewhere.	positive
title: Wish I had gotten this for my first!! [SEP] content: This may be one of the best baby products on the market! My younger daughter will never use a traditional high chair. this takes up so much less space and allows her to "sit" at the table with us while we are eating. it is transportable... clean and simple... easy to use! i can't say enough! love this high chair! would never have gotten the huge one i used for my first (cute but cumbersome)... this rocks	positive
title: BIG SIZE COOKIE BIG SIZE TASTE [SEP] content: Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies are not just for breakfast. You can have one anytime and they are so big you will enjoy eating them for a long time. We ordered the Oatmeal Raisin cookies and they were so moist and delicious. I wondered where they were going to so fast and discovered that my husband was taking them to work with him. So they must be very good because he is not a dessert person at all!	positive
title: Great Piano, but lost the sheet music..... [SEP] content: A very nice little piano for a toddler. Our daughter pretty much just mashes her hands on it (16 months old), but she enjoys doing that. Anyway, we lost the sheet music that comes with it. Does anyone know of a way to get the sheet music for the Melissa and Doug learn to play piano? The sheet music is letter coordinated with letters above the keys for this piano specifically.	positive
