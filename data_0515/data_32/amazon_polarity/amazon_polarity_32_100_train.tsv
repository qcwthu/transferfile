title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: I like it... [SEP] content: This was not a need but a want. I am a gadget freak and I also like good quality kitchen appliances.Works very well...to make MY Egg M?Muffins. I wish it had a lid..but it does not and so I use a small plate to cover.T-Fal...are you listening....how about a simple cover...with a simple handle... thanks :) This would give it 5 stars.	positive
title: Can't imagine a better performance! [SEP] content: I am clearly an amatuer regarding such matters, but I have never for a second regretted purchasing this set and find the performances and the recordings to be flawless. The Choral Fantasy was an unexpected bonus. I was not familiar with it when I bought this set, but now it is one of my favorites.I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with these recordings.	positive
title: Best Speaking Translator I've seen [SEP] content: I recently purchased & returned other speaking translators (voice phrase books / talking dictionaries) from other companies (other brands). This Franklin model is by far the best: clear, natural, speaking voice, vs. a computer-generated "robot voice", with others. My only criticism is that the speaking voice is too fast. At least it can be repeated as often as necessary.	positive
title: ultimate food count book [SEP] content: The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that.	positive
title: not as the picture tells [SEP] content: if your looking for 10 great disc of 70's music then this is the place if your looking for a great box set to show off then your out of luck the box these CDs are pictured in is not included all i got was 5 CD cases (2 CDs in a case)scotch taped together i called amazone and they sent a replacement the next day but still no box ended up getting a discount and thats why it still got 5 stars sorry for the big run on mess but it may have saved you some money and time	positive
title: Million Dollar Consulting Toolkit [SEP] content: This is a good book for anyone considering starting a home-based consultancy. I have been cosluting for many years, the last ten or so from a home office. This is not an easy transition and I found the toolkit helpful in many ways.It would have been extremely useful had I had it when I started out many years ago. Useful when I made the change to a home office and I found it still full of useful things after 35 years in the business.For the consultant that operates alone this book should be on the reference shelf.(after it has been read of course!)Murray Harvey	positive
title: A must read for every lanlord and landlady [SEP] content: The landlord's Kit is an extremely well written guide to making more money and saving alot of headache in managing property.There are a ton of great ideas that really work.Mr. Taylor aka Mr. Landlord has been helping other landlords for years...it is great to see many of his ideas in book form. The forms,letters and notices are worth a fortune. Read this book and do what it says...it works!	positive
title: Real CSI show! [SEP] content: It's just like the real program on TV! I felt like I'm part of the team! It's no graphic play, but definitely entertaining! I bought the 2nd edition, too!	positive
title: Question, not a review [SEP] content: Does this movie have subtitles? It doesn't show that in the description, but with a release in Sept. 2011, I would have thought it would. My parents and I love this movie and I rated it based on seeing it on TCM previously	positive
title: Kindle [SEP] content: The Kindle device is truly amazing. I bought four of them; one for myself and three as Christmas gifts.I have two suggestions for future redesigns:1. Relocate the On-Off and the Antenna switches from the back of the device to the top leading edge. This makes it unnecessary to remove the device from its cover.2. To the right and left of the "amazonkindle" logo, add raised areas for thumbs to "dig in", making it easier to hold the device (especially when in bed, about to drift off into "la-la land"!).	positive
title: Good, but not quite 5 stars [SEP] content: If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me	positive
title: Graphic SF Reader [SEP] content: This book has Swamp Thing in outer space for a fair part of it, as he encounters various other dc figures in his travels, such as those from the planet Rann, and the odd Green Lantern, and even the New Gods.He does eventually end up back on Earth, and is a little peeved with some of the bad guys.As The Shadow would say, if Swamp Thing is after you, 'The weeds of crime bear bitter fruit.'	positive
title: saucepan [SEP] content: Product is very good. However the handle does get a little hot when boiling water. But otherwise good. Prompt delivery.	positive
title: Shadows Dance Sad Waltzes with a Sigh of Rapture [SEP] content: The above title is from a quote in the booklet, "in the north there are a lot of shadows. there are far more shadows than people. in the south the shadows are sharper and clearer. it is easier to talk to them. in the north, they dance sad waltzes with a sigh of rapture." - per kirkeby. This describes better than I can the exquisite interleaving of the fiddle of Ola Backstrom, the nykelharpa (keyed fiddle) of Johan Hedin and the sax of Jonas Knutsson. Each of these musicians is a virtuoso on their instrument and together these tracks are hypnotic and soaring at the same time. One of my all time favorite albums. Has proved excellent car music also, traveling through the snow fields of Minnesota I arrive serene.	positive
title: Considering the price, these are fantastic! [SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.	positive
title: great atmospheric gangster movie [SEP] content: I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE LE SAMOURAI. STARRING ALAIN DELON AS ASSASSIN JEF COSTELLO.. I ALWAYS LIKED ALAIN DELON FOR SUCH A PRETTY BOY HE SURE PLAYS GREAT BADGUYS AND THATS HARD TO DO IF YOUR AS GOOD-LOOKING AS HE IS. ALAIN DELON PLAYS A HITMAN, A LONE WOLF, WHEN HE KILLS A NIGHTCLUB OWNER, A BEAUTIFUL BLACK PIANIST SEES HIM CLOSE UP BUT PROTECTS HIS ALIBI WHEN SHE IS QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE. ALAIN DELONS GIRLFRIEND IN THE MOVIE AND AT THE TIME ALAINS REAL LIFE WIFE, NATHALIE DELON PROTECTS HIS ALIBI TOO. JEF COSTELLO (ALAIN DELON) FINDS THE POLICE AND DOUBLE CROSSING MOB ASSOCIATES HOT ON HIS TAIL. I WONT RUIN THE ENDING AND THE GREAT CHASE SCENES BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM.	positive
title: The best Morandi title under $200.00 [SEP] content: The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)	positive
title: Good deal for the price point [SEP] content: I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. She requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. These seem to meet all those criteria. I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. I advised my daughter NOT to test them for water resistance!	positive
title: a page turner [SEP] content: This was my first book by Phillip Margolin and I enjoyed it alot.Very fast moving and somewhat gruesome but good.I was able to figure out who the killer was about halfway through the book but that didn't take away from the suspense.I'll read more of his books-in fact the first chapter of The Associate was at the end of this book and the first chapter was enough for me to want to read it.He will be on my authors -to -watch -out- for-list.	positive
title: Gory yet beautiful, not as good as the others. [SEP] content: I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Jean de Florette et Manon des sources [SEP] content: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une réponse de vous.	positive
title: Russo novels seldom disappoint [SEP] content: The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. I've read six of Russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. It starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it.	positive
title: The Best Peeler Ever!!!! [SEP] content: I LOVE this peeler. The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. I know they call it a "soft-skin" peeler, but I've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. Since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! That never happened before!	positive
title: good productive [SEP] content: I purchased this product because it seemed interesting. Originally I thought I would use it for my creative writing. But it has become a daily tool for many things. It is very good	positive
title: Im in my Element! [SEP] content: Hearing this sound at "Q" in Adelaide made me only do one thing- go out and buy it. Why you ask, 'cos i was in my element. These raw beats produce an exillorating felling in my system. For those who play it hard, let yourself go and go even faster. But what ever you do dont turn back!	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Thank you [SEP] content: The book arrived just on time. It was my pleasure to purchase book from your company. The book itself is very interesting too.	positive
title: Simply gorgeous [SEP] content: One of the places that most inspired Matisse was Morocco, a country of huge contrasts, vivid colors and dramatic landscapes .I missed the landmark exhibition for which this book served as the catalog, but I purchased it after vacationing in Morocco. Matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of Moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. It is also informed and inspired by Moroccan design, which combines Mediterranean and Islamic elements to beautiful effect.	positive
title: Difficult decision [SEP] content: Excellent! This really is a great collection of mixes. When I pop this one in my car, I find it hard to decide which one to start with. Here's me thinking: "Let's see, I'll start with... the original version, NO WAIT! number three, NO TWO! FOUR, I meant FOUR! NO TWO!!!..." No wonder I'm always late for work - I spend half my day dancing in the car. A must-have for those who like remixed k.d.	positive
title: This product does not work! [SEP] content: Dont buy this! It really sucks and does not warm the towels. The bars feel warm, but when you put a towel on the bars it only warms right where the towels touch. Not the whole towel. In the process of getting my money back	negative
title: Soft Metal Means These Break After 1-2 Uses [SEP] content: I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail. The price seemed unbeatable, and they fit securely to all of my standard bits. However, the metal in the hex screws is very soft, and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application. But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall, plaster, etc., then you could secure them less tightly to your bits (and thus, hopefully, delay stripping the cheap screws).	negative
title: Good information, but redundant. [SEP] content: I purchased this book to assist in staff training. I have found it to contain useful information. However, after the first chapter, it tends to repeat itself without introducing much new helpful information. There are lots of checklists for staff self-evaluations that, when scored, do not include information on improving their weak areas. Also, as this book was written for the UK, I have found the language to be interesting, but a slight drawback. There is quite a bit of UK slang (such as tatty, taken out of a skip, put a tick in the appropriate column, etc.). And there was an interesting, but not so useful for the US, chapter on British Telecom.	negative
title: Not a Garrett PI series #2 [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Passage of Arms because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.	negative
title: Downright Silly, Not Funny [SEP] content: Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas. The movie is plain silly, not funny. This guy is worse than Jar-Jar Binks.Hard to imagine anybody could find this show funny.This is the worst comedy that I come across so far.	negative
title: City Baby L.A. - Dont buy it, use a phone book. [SEP] content: This book is pages and pages of listings of things like daycare centers and their phone numbers. It is also geared toward the woman who is about to have a baby a lot. Dont waste your money. Buy "Baby's day out in Southern California" which is the great book recommended by the triple-A.	negative
title: Not Worth the Trouble. [SEP] content: While the game appeals to a certain juvenile streak, the fun quickly wears off. The humour value of being able to steal every car on the screen is limited at best. You are left with a repetive game with very little plot to drive it forward. You end up merely driving around the city in circles.	negative
title: Weak copy of need for speed [SEP] content: Everything about this game is lame, the graphics , the user interface, and the very slow since of speed, car's going 150 mph feel like 70 mph! you can pump up your ride to 600+HP! and cars with 200HP will beat you! If you are a fan of need for speed underground stay away from this stinker!! This game is very dissapointing! avoid it at all cost's!!!	negative
title: What a Pervert! [SEP] content: This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been "watching [the heroine] from afar". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist."Love" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book.	negative
title: Crappy crap crap (crap) [SEP] content: This Clerks-esk low budget film is, shall I say, crap. I love Bam and his CKY disks and Viva La Bam make me laugh so hard I have to pee. This movie was poorly acted (no surprise) but the crew are actually trying to act so it just seems dumb. DiCamillo was annoying as usual. The "plot" was boring and average. There are a few truly funny moments but not enough to warrent buying this DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy a CKY DVD.	negative
title: Looks great - if only it worked! [SEP] content: This is a great looking player with seemingly solid construction however after approximately 45 minutes of use, the screen went blank. Thereafter, it would shut down after 20 seconds of play. I returned the item for replacement, hoping that I had just received a dud. The replacement player worked during its initial use however thereafter same problem as before. Moveover, the sound was never great - especially for use in the car. At full volume, it could hardly be heard above the road noise. I would not recommend this player but, as always, Amazon was super to work with and their customer service cannot be beat.	negative
title: College text [SEP] content: I had purchased this book expecting it to be in "very good" condition as noted by the seller. Unfortunately, it is in fair condition, at best. I was very disappointed. The extensive highlighting and underlining make it difficult to use.	negative
title: if you're not a right winger, this book is awful [SEP] content: i feel like i've been trying to read this book for years, but it's only been a day and it says i'm only 12% done, egads, i can't go on. the racial slur when the main character slams arabs, then realizing the girl he's with is an arab changes it to muslims....and she concurs! please....i'm stopping this now before i have to go out and buy an uzi	negative
title: unfortunate [SEP] content: i'm sorry to say this because Kevin Smith is one of my favorites and i'm a true fan so i gave this movie a shot too bad it was pretty terrible. I'm sorry but please miss this movie wait for Clerks 2: The passion of the clerks coming summer 2005	negative
title: Not very good [SEP] content: Although the author has obviously spent a good amount of time doing his research, the time might have been better spent developing a coherent plot or creating charaters of any substance. With all of the excellent books available, you might want to give this one a pass.	negative
title: lasted 6 weeks [SEP] content: lasted 6 weeks then inexplicably went out. not sure if i got a dud or if others have experienced this.	negative
title: What are you guys smoking.... [SEP] content: This game was the worst. I got quite far, but it was boring the whole time. The fist couple of missions are fun. Once they get too challanging you realize that your doing the same exact stuff as you were doing on teh first mission, just a lot faster. The cops have to intelligence at all, they just go directly at your car. The game is a MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY. I reccomend using your money wisely on something like Onimusha, that's a great game with better graphics, gameplay, plot, and variety. Don't waste your money or time. I am aware that this review is on the contrary to most of the others, but I feel that you should take my advice. After two complete hours of gameplay I was bored out of my mind	negative
title: Not a fan. [SEP] content: This particular product takes up way too much free space on my computer. Actually slowed it down a bit. I have 320 GB with 4 GB memory. Kaspersky seems to work better and I didn't have any problem with that at all. Would not personally recommend Norton.	negative
title: not the real Fantasia [SEP] content: Unfortunately, this is another example of the Idol folks trying to mimic trends vs. really letting an artist shine. Fantasia is a great vocalist and the overdubbing and layering on this CD hides her uniqueness--makes it a Beyonce ripoff attempt. Too bad--looks like we'll have to wait a release or two before we get the real Fantasia.	negative
title: I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review [SEP] content: Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL	negative
title: rock key hider [SEP] content: This rock key hider does one little good unless you happen tobe carrying around a screwdriver; that's right, the key is obtainable only by unsrewing the plastic on the bottom side of the rock. Oh, and did I mention that the rock looks as phony as a three dollar bill?Why didn't they simply make the slot-a slide version-a complete waste of money.	negative
title: Baptist bashing approach to St. John [SEP] content: If you would like an exercise in Baptist theology purchase this commentary. If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru. This is possibly the worst commentary on St. John that Eerdmans have ever published.	negative
title: Not very good... [SEP] content: I really wanted to give this book a 2 and 1/2 stars. A quater of this book was really good. The rest was dull, confusing and not well written.	negative
title: Defective [SEP] content: They must be selling all their defective units now. The first one I got stopped working after a month. The one I got a week ago one of the fans didn't work when it came out the box, it also has a short in the cable. Beware of defective units.	negative
title: Dated Material, Some over 40 Years Old [SEP] content: If you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, I think you can do better.That said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. Though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 60s.Some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in Mike Markel's "Technical Communication" or Carolyn Rude's "Technical Editing."If your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. You'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as I will. It makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale.	negative
title: Doesn't keep things hot [SEP] content: I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure.	negative
title: They dont know what else to do...... [SEP] content: This has to be another effort to be alive on the music industry. The live performance is the same one that come with the DVD from Greatest Hits Part 1. They add "new tracks" as Proud which is on the soundtrack of the movie I know what you did last summer. Earache my eye its the last song from Follow the leader but live. One is from the tribute to Metallica. If all that is "rare" they are really desperate for money.Dont buy this CD buy the new tool Cd which is way better.	negative
title: Broke within 1 month, useless [SEP] content: Don't waste your money! We thought these beds would be perfect for our two dogs, and we ordered extra large to accomodate their respective weights (both under 100 pounds). We bought a total of four beds and three of them broke within one month. Like other reviewers, we saw that the bolts sheared off and as a result, the beds are not able to be repaired. We have asked for a refund; I am optimistic...	negative
title: Failed Attempted Frenzy [SEP] content: This game is not up to the standard of the other x-box titles. The graphics are bland, the landscapes are dull & boring. There are many other games being launched at the same time as this one. I would wait for something a bit more "Next Generation".	negative
title: London Blue Topaz Earrings [SEP] content: I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, it looks as if you could have bought this at a discount store	negative
title: Three weeks, and no results [SEP] content: I been using this cream for three weeks now, and not seen any results. Your better off making it your self. All you need is Baling Soda and Castor Oil to make a paste. Thats all.	negative
title: Well it hasn't caught on fire yet. [SEP] content: It doesn't work at all. The drive is recognized by the USB driver but the RAID utility can not find it or initialize. I have 20 years experience with PC, build my own, have done software and hardware raid under Windows and Linux. This thing should just work. Technical support has hung up on me after being on hold for 15 minutes twice. So I'm guessing they just have so many problems that they are dumping their call queues to avoid busy signals.Your going to be wasting a lot of time with something that really should be a non event.Stay away from this product.	negative
