We celebrate what we are thankful for and mostly for the freedom that our forefathers fought so hard for.

We start with the youngest and move to the oldest. It builds awareness in our family of what we are grateful for.	Society & Culture

question_title: People have been saying to me "But what if you are wrong what if god does exist?" well here is the answer. [SEP] question_content: If I am wrong and god does exist (which is unlikely) I can look him in the eyes and say I have tried to examine and understand the universe the best I could and I couldn't see you in it." But now what if I'm right there is no supreme being for us to be afraid of offending no one can be accused of playing god because he doesn't exist so science is free to advance without hindrance and that will expanded our knowledge of the universe and save billions of lives as we develop new effective cures for diseases and improve billions of others as new technology is developed .  Also there wouldn't be as much discrimination or war as religion is the main cause of that.  Oh what a wonderful world it would be.  So there you go that is what happens if I am wrong and what happens if I'm right and personally I think it's worth the gamble (not much of a gamble as there is no evidence to suggest god does exist so that would mean I am right just the sooner you theists admit it the better for everyone).

question_title: Define "True Friend"? [SEP] question_content: There is so many people that we can call "friends" around us. But it's just so little one that can be called "true friends". Can you define what's true friend, and what's the best way to get a true friend? [SEP] best_answer: True friends are those who never let you down and are there for you (even by email) when you need them, and if they can't they look for a way to make it up to you.. They make you smile, make you cry, and make you angry when they tell you the awful truth that you don't want to hear... They save you when you need it (and when they can) and they support you, even if they sometimes don't understand you... THey let you go and crash when you're stubborn about sdomething that's not right, but they're always there to pick you up and heal you after that crash... True friends are the most important people after your family (and in some cases after your couple)... \n\nThe best way to get one is by doing all the things above with someone that is just your plain friend.. and he/she'll do the same for you eventually... ;)	Society & Culture

question_title: Does this look like an indication of the some (not all) of the answers floating around here??? [SEP] question_content: The Dangers of the Last Days 2 Timothy Chp 3\nYou should also know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. 2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. 3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control; they will be cruel and have no interest in what is good. 4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. 5 They will act as if they are religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. You must stay away from people like that. [SEP] best_answer: Yeah you bet ... but it is not really a suprise because we live in a fallen world. All of us "fall short" and its just that those that don't "love Him" have a different heart, you will recognise a tree by its fruit - out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks - a good tree does not bear bad fruit and in the same way a bad tree will not bear good fruit. You have a Bible, you know the verses. I guess that some of the folks that "know Him" don't come on here due to some of the content on here such as that you have referred to.

Be honest with her and with yourself. But also respect her. She has her reasons for wanting to protect you. You will only understand when you become a parent yourself, as I am now.	Society & Culture

question_title: Purpose??? [SEP] question_content: Unless I'm wrong, christians and other such religions believe that life is a test to see whether you go to heaven or hell.\n\nWell, even if it were true, what would be the point?\n\nYou can live on Earth or in heaven, what's it matter?\n\nAlso, don't the supposed gods already know everything?  They know exactly how they made you, and since they are perfcet, they know that you can't turn out in any other way then they meant for you to turn out, sort of eliminating the idea of free will.  So how is it a test if they already know whether or not you will go to heaven or hell.  Also, since god knows how he made you, and if you go to hell, isn't it HIS fault? He knows exactly how he made you, and he knows that you'll go to hell, so why did he do it in the first place?\n\nWhat's the point of this life if we just go to heaven or hell?  This ife isn't a test to see if we're worthy or not becaue they already know if we're worthy...\n\nNone of it adds up...

question_title: are you a psychic or have you had premonitions? [SEP] question_content: I do believe in paranormal stuff but I'm a little sceptical about the whole psychic thing!  But this is what happened and my mom thinks it is premonitions, I think it is coincidence!  I had a dream about a fire and my dad came home that day and said that one of the old antique million dollar homes in town had burn down.  Then I had a dream about the space shuttle exploding (I thought is was about the challenger)  so I was asking my mom a lot of questions about it and then we watched Columbia and we were like whoa!!  I still say coincidence.  Well my boss hasn't been feeling well and he is really stressed out and the night before last I had a dream that he had a heart attack!  And when I came in yesterday a co-worker said that he had suffered from a mild heart attack!  Is this a gift or coincidence?  And if it is a gift how can I get a handle on it!  Or am I just a loony?  If you have these abilities could you please help me with a little more info about what I am experiencing!  Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: There are NO coincidences.  There are also quite a few folks out and around that have prophetic dreams.  It is a natural talent, just like music in some, that comes from more development/use of your right brain lobe.  \n\nHow to handle it? That's a bit more difficult.  You can't compare your talents to others.  Just compare them to past occurances you'd had and weigh them from there. I wouldn't advise you to tell others what you suspect is coming but you learn by experience at it occurs more.	Society & Culture
question_title: What age of your life did you decide what you believe about religion? [SEP] question_content: Are you firm in your beliefs? Do you still have nagging questions?\nI believe I am a Christian, however I do not take the Bible as literal fact, especially the Old Testament [SEP] best_answer: It actually occured over time.  I was raised a Methodist, but by the time i was in Sixth Grade (now 27 years ago), I began to see there was more out there, at least from the scientific side.  I began to be pretty heavy into science in high school, then began to study religions in the last two years I was in high school.  I had an English teacher than encouraged me to continue to study about them (as a comparative-type study, not a theological path).  \n\nWhen I went to college, I took a major in religion.  I mainly wanted to study world religions, but wound up taking a lot of classes in the Bible.  By the time I had left college, I had read quite a few of the sacred texts of the world's religions (including most of the Bible).  I had even read some of the apocryphal Bible (Old and New Testaments).  I began to believe in Deism during college, but didn't really have a name for it.  \n\nI am a firm believer in Deism today and I really can say I have no nagging questions.  It is a very logical, reasoned religion without a sacred text.  For me, it works.	Society & Culture
question_title: Does Gospel of Judas proves the Islamic version of the end days of Jesus? [SEP] question_content: According to Islam,Eesa(Jesus)was not crucified. Instead the one who revealed him was crucified.\n The Gospel of Judas narrates that Jesus said to Judas that 'you will sacrifice the man that clothes me'.Is Judas the mistaken identity of Jesus for all these years people beleived him to be Jesus. [SEP] best_answer: If the Gospel of Judas was a proper Gospel then it would still not corrabote - as Jesus WAS crucified - but the difference was that Judas is made out to be the hero - as it frees Jesus' spirit from his body - which apparently was the mission.\n\nHowever, this just is not consistent with the fact that Jesus healed people - if the purpose is to free spirits from the flesh then while heal the flesh (and He still does today - see my question on miracles).\n\nBut given that it was written by the Gnostics 200 years later then no.  But it does provide an interesting insight into the Gnostics beliefs.	Society & Culture
question_title: What if you discover that all of your church offerings went to the pastor's prostitutes? [SEP] question_content: You actually thought your money(10% of your income) was going to god.  Would you feel soooo stupid?  What if that's just the beginning.  What if you discovered that God doesn't even exist after you have prayed twice a day for 50 years.  That's a lot of waisted time. [SEP] best_answer: I am speachless..if there are such pastors they must be punished severely first here,then they will have ample time in confessing their sins in the Purgatory and their souls will be in Hell..

question_title: Where do old sayings like "a stitch in time saves nine" come from? Why do we remember them? What do they mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When ALL sewing was done by hand, it was quite a chore to make an article of clothing. IF a stitch popped, a quick repair saved one heck of a lot of time, because, as you well know, if you mend something that just starts to break, it is easy. To fix the whole thing is really difficult. \n"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" is obvious. The world is full of wisdom in these sayings.	Society & Culture

question_title: Any good none-box office movies ? [SEP] question_content: im fed up with the hollywood crap blockbusters... [SEP] best_answer: Try either "Return to Paradise" "Dark City" or "Mean Creek".  They are all fabulous movie that had little box office success but recieved critical acclaim.  Mean Creek is the only one that is Indie.  Return to Paradise does have stars in it, but kind of flopped.  it is a GREAT movie though.  Dark City is probably one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.  Better than the Matrix and it came out before it and unfortunatly tanked.  Roger Ebert loves it enough to do a commentary track for the DVD by himself for the entire movie, and has given lectures just on this movie.  \n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0124595/     --- Return to Paradise\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0118929/     --- Dark City\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0377091/     --- Mean Creek\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051106/REVIEWS08/511060302/1023    --- Roger Ebert's Dark City review for his "Great Movie" collection.

question_title: What is the very best joke you know? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is long, but soooo funny:\n\nA little rabbit is hopping through the forest when he comes upon a bear rolling a joint.  He says to the bear, 'why are you doing that, Mr. Bear, please think about your health and put down that joint and come running through the forest with me, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  So the bear thinks about and agrees, off they go running through the forest together.  As they are enjoying their run through the forest they come up to a giraffe about to snort a line of c*ke.  The rabbit is horrified and says to the giraffe 'why are you doing that, Mr. Giraffe, please think about your health and put down that mirror and straw and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  Very hesitant the giraffe gives in and puts down his items and joins the rabbit and bear on their escapade through the forest.  The three of them are now having a blast running freely when they see a lion about to shoot up.  The rabbit quickly runs to him and says 'why are you doing that, Mr. Lion, please think about your health and put down that needle and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  The lion is irritated that he was interrupted, but he puts down his needle, walks over to the rabbit, grabs him by the ears and begins to beat him senseless.  The bear and giraffe are standing there in horror, they scream and plead with the lion to stop asking him 'why are you doing this to him, he is merely trying to help you!?'.  The lion looks at them and says 'bullsh!t, he's not trying to help, everytime he's on ecstasy he makes me run through the forest with him for hours looking like an idiot'.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: what is the importance of solar energy and why do people use and where does it come from? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is suppose to be common sense by now well unless you're 6 yr old then that's different. So I guess you need read this:\n\nsolar energy, any form of energy radiated by the sun, including light, radio waves, and X rays, although the term usually refers to the visible light of the sun. Solar energy is needed by green plants for the process of photosynthesis, which is the ultimate source of all food. The energy in fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil) and other organic fuels (e.g., wood) is derived from solar energy. Difficulties with these fuels have led to the invention of devices that directly convert solar energy into usable forms of energy, such as electricity. Solar batteries, which operate on the principle that light falling on photosensitive substances causes a flow of electricity, play an important part in space satellites and, as they become more efficient, are finding increasing use on the earth (see solar cell). Thermoelectric generators convert the heat generated by solar energy directly into electricity (see thermoelectricity). Several projects have produced electricity on a large scale by using the solar energy available in desert areas. In one system, large numbers of solar batteries generate electricity for Coconut Island, off the coast of Australia. In another, oil flows through pipes that are set in reflecting parabolic troughs that can trap the heat from sunlight falling on them. The heat from the oil is then converted into electricity (see power, electric). Heat from the sun is used in air-drying a variety of materials and in producing salt by the evaporation of seawater. Solar heating systems can supply heat and hot water for domestic use; heat collected in special plates on the roof of a house is stored in rocks or water held in a large container. Such systems, however, usually require a conventional heater to supplement them. Solar stoves, which focus the sun's heat directly, are employed in regions where there is much perennial sunlight.\n\nAlso there are tons of info on this on the web just go to Yahoo search or Google and type in Solar Energy. It's not that hard.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is chip designing ,explain with an example? [SEP] question_content: can this designing be confined only to printed circuit boards? [SEP] best_answer: The process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from national power grids all the way down to the individual transistors within an integrated circuit. For simple circuits the design process can often be done by one person simply designing the circuit as they go along, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common.\n\nFormal circuit design usually involves the following stages:\n\nsometimes, writing the requirement specification after liaising with the customer \nwriting a technical proposal to meet the requirements of the customer specification \nsynthesising on paper an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will meet the specifications \ncalculating the component values to meet the operating specifications under specified conditions \nbuilding a breadboard or other prototype version of the design and testing against specification \nmaking any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance \nchoosing a method of construction as well as all the parts and materials to be used \npresenting component and layout information to draughtspersons, and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production \ntesting or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer reqiurements \nsigning and approving the final manufacturing drawings \npost-design services (obsolescence of components etc.) \nContents [hide]\n1 Specification \n2 Design \n2.1 Costs \n3 Verification and testing \n4 Prototyping \n5 Results \n5.1 Documentation \n6 See also \n7 References \n \n\n\n[edit]\nSpecification\nThe process of circuit design begins with the specification, which states the functionality that the finished design must provide, but does not indicate how it is to be achieved .[1] The initial specification is basically a technically detailed description of what the customer wants the finished circuit to achieve and can include a variety of electrical requirements, such as what signals the circuit will receive, what signals it must output, what power supplies are available and how much power it is permitted to consume. The specification can ( and normally does ) also set some of the physical parameters that the design must meet, such as size, weight, moisture resistance, temperature range, thermal output, vibration tolerance and acceleration tolerance.\n\nAs the design process progresses the designer(s) will frequently return to the specification and alter it to take account of the progress of the design. This can involve tightening specifications that the customer has supplied, and adding tests that the circuit must pass in order to be accepted. These additional specifications will often be used in the verification of a design. Changes that conflict with or modify the customer's original specifications will almost always have to be approved by the customer before they can be acted upon.\n\nCorrectly identifying the customer needs can avoid a condition known as 'design creep' which occurs in the absence of realistic initial expectations, and later by failing to communicate fully with the client during the design process. It can be defined in terms of its results; "at one extreme is a circuit with more functionality than necessary, and at the other is a circuit having an incorrect functionality". (DeMers, 1997) Nevertheless some changes can be expected and the wise designer keeps his options open: it's easier to remove spare gates from the circuit later on than it is to put them in.\n\n[edit]\nDesign\nThe design process involves moving from the specification at the start, to a plan that contains all the information needed to be physically constructed at the end, this normally happens by passing through a number of stages, although in very simple circuit it may be done in a single step. [2] The process normally begins with the conversion of the specification into a block diagra	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What gas evolves when zinc in the form of powder is added to a solution of water and copper sulfate.? [SEP] question_content: This is part of the cycle of copper chemical reactions. [SEP] best_answer: Zinc is a much more reactive metal than Copper.  Zinc is much higher on the activity series than Copper.\n\nWhen Zinc metal is added to a Copper +2 solution, the Zinc will displace the Copper in solution, precipiating out Copper metal while Zinc ions go into solution.\n\nZn (s) + Cu+2 (aq) --> Zn+2 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nSince Zinc (II) Sulfate is soluble in water, the Sulfate (SO4-2) ion is a spectator ion in the reaction, it is in solution on both sides of the reaction.

[SEP] question_content: In 1973 i with my whole squad saw a flying multi-colored fire with absolutely no sound at all. It was flying very smoothly and silently across the early evening when the sun was still over the hill. That was in AnLoc-A battle field-so at that time I just dooubted if it was just a kind of weapon;\nNow I think that it might have been a UFO. I want to know more about these phenomenon. [SEP] best_answer: Have no doubt of the exisitence of UFO's or the Beings that pilot them, There are several sightings a day Worldwide but never get Media Exposure unless its blatently obvious, due to the Governments'belief that it would cause Panic and Chaos on the streets. The simple fact is , if that the Idea or notion should make you wonder,than trust and believe that your not the only one who does.How can the possibility of extra-terrestial life NOT exist? The 'Rozwell Incident' was no hoax!! and was promptly swept under the carpet by Government whitewashing techniques.The consesus of people who kept investigating Rozwell, echo words of a 'Trade Off' with the Beings who survived the crash,..There Technology for their ability to continue with whatever they were here for in the first place.It would seem ignorant,for lack of a better word,and closed minded to assume that there is NO other Life forms in the entire expanse of our known Galaxy or for that fact our Universe.Ive taken a keen interest in the existence of Intelligent Life forms after the eye witness account of one of the Space Shuttle Astronauts(and crew) while attached to a teather in open Space.There are 2 sources that might interest you, if you  wish to further investigate;~~~~~~~1) The Bob Lazar Story... \nIn 1989, Robert Lazar came forward with an incredible story : He had been recruited by the US government to work at the top secret Groom Lake/Area 51 research base better known as "Dreamland" (actually at the S4 site, Papoose Lake which is a few miles to the south of Groom Lake) to reverse engineer alien spacecraft! Here are a few things he learned. \nThe disc's reactor uses a fuel which does not occur naturally on Earth. This fuel is a super-heavy, stable, element with an atomic number of 115 and does not appear on our periodic chart. Element 115 has a twofold purpose : First, it is the source of a gravity wave that is unknown to Earth's scientists, the "Gravity A" wave. Second, it is the source of the anti-matter radiation which is reacted to provide power.\nThe Gravity A wave eminates from the nucleus of Element 115 and actually extends past the perimeter of the atom. The propulsion system of the disc amplifies and focuses this Gravity A wave to cause space/time to bend, much like space/time bends in the intense gravitational field of a black hole. The ability to direct gravity to cause space/time distortions allows the disc to cross vast expanses of space/time without travelling in a linear mode at a high rate of speed. \nInside the reactor, the Element 115 is transmuted to Element 116 which is unstable and immediately decays releasing antimatter. The antimatter is reacted with gaseous matter which causes a total annihilation reaction, the 100 percent conversion of matter to energy. The heat from this reaction is converted to electrial energy by a solid state, near 100 percent efficient thermoelectric generator. It is this energy that is used to amplify the Gravity A wave. \nThis mode of travel is one of the two methods of propulsion used by the disc. In this mode, the disc's gravity amplifiers  are in the "delta configuration" and are pulsed sequentially in a rotational pattern. This amplified Gravity A wave is so powerful that the only natural occurring source of gravity that could cause space/time to distort this much would be a black hole! \nThe other mode of travel is the "omicron configuration" and is used for short range travel near a source of gravity such as a planet or star. When a disc travels near another source of gravity, like Earth, the Gravity A wave, which propagates outward from the disc, is phase shifted into the Gravity B wave, which propagates outward from the Earth, and this creates lift. The gravity amplifiers of the disc can be focused independently and they are pulsed and do not stay on continuously.  \nAlien UFO propulsion systems according to Bob Lazar...2) this is a websi	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What are SPECTRA ropes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: SPECTRA® Double Braided\n\nOne of the most popular high performance lines, G-Force is a double braided rope consisting of 100% polyester braided cover and a 100% Allied Signal's Spectra® braided core. It was engineered for General Marine, Industrial, and Commercial Fishing applications where extra low elongation and extremely high strength-to-weight ratio of Spectra® are required. Spectra® double braided rope often replaces wire of the same diameter. Great for Merchant Marine, Industrial, Commercial Fishing, and Recreational Boating applications. \n\nThis rope offers extremely high strength and low stretch, and is one of the toughest lines around. The HMPE minor tendency to creep is minimized with advanced core design, and this rope is much more tolerant of standard size sheaves than an aramid (e.g. Kevlar®, Twaron®) rope. Because the specific gravity of Spectra® is less than 1.0, size-for-size G-Force is one of the lighter ropes around. Downsize and your weight savings is twofold. This is one tough rope, built to withstand mistrals and gale force winds! The cover is a dazzling tri-color weave, a base color combined with two separate multi-tracers running in opposite directions.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how do the cells produced by meiosis reeestablish a complete set pf chromosomes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Remember that meiosis is the formation of gametes from germ cells.  Our bodies begin the process of making germ cells very early in our development, and the precursors to sperm/egg cells are in tact well before puberty.  When a woman ovulates, at the end, four of these egg cells complete the maturity stage in each cycle, but only one survives to become an ovulated egg (accompanied by 3 polar bodies).  This egg (and its complement sperm) have ONE set of chromosomes each, and upon fertilization, the zygote will have 2 copies of every chromosome, one from the sperm, and one from the egg.

question_title: What is the difference between amps and horsepower? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the motor and VFD variable frequency drive industry, the standard speak is Amps, which is replacing HP old school.\n\nYou must realize that in an industry in which the typical 3phase power is based on 480VAC.\n\nThis means when someone is sizing a motor for a specific application they speak of the Amps need to perform the task.\n\nThe drives (VFD) which I work on are typically between 10amp up to 3000amp. Usually, 480Vac, sometimes 600Vac or 690Vac.\nA drive which is rated at 690Vac, 705amp is 600Vac, 800amp for the same drive.\n\nYou need to know both, HP and Amp for the machines which you are interested in. That means what is the typical voltage for the area. USA vs Canada vs UK vs Asia They are all different. \n\nKeep in mind Amps are Amps regardless where you are. Heavy wire sizing is crucial.

question_title: Is evolution possible? Does the scientific advancements gives enough evidence for it? [SEP] question_content: Please answer this with reference to the complexity of life and the chance of origin of life from a state of nothingness. [SEP] best_answer: First, let me get some ambiguous terms out of the way. First, there's micro-evolution. This is like breeding dogs to get the dog you want. Then, there's macro-evolution, which is breeding dogs to get a human after milllions of years. Okay.\nMicro-evolution is, obviously, possible because the genes of the dogs change to let it's grandchild be a different kind of dog. However, there's a limit to how much genes can change. After a while, the dog will be really different from his ancestors (chihuahuas and great danes) but can never turn into a non-dog. I've never seen a dog give birth to a cat-dog. It's just not possible. Think of it this way. If you take the word "Cat" and change one letter at a time, you can come up with "hat," "mat," and "pat." Can you ever come up with "orange?" No, orange doesn't have three letters.\n  The only way for evolution to be possible is if a lizard mates with a squirrel to produce a bird. And I don't think it's possible for that to happen, do you? Sure, donkeys and horses can mate to produce mules, but they're related (like dogs and wolves.)\n   If you ever see an owl-kangaroo, I'll take this back.

question_title: How do you solve the Math Puzzle of the Hexagonal Pattern "The disguised triangles?"? [SEP] question_content: I am looking for how to prove the correct answer. [SEP] best_answer: I'm assuming you are referring to the disguised triangles in the attached link... (link 1).  I'm sure there are some rigorous mathematical proofs you could supply, or automated ways to count the triangles, but I basically decided to just use the "brute force" method of counting.  The hard part is recognizing all the different triangles while not double counting...\n\nWhat I finally did was to create several copies of the diagram and tried to color the triangles.  You can color the individual triangles (24), right off the bat.  Now if you try to pair up triangles, you can pair them one way (12) or another using the flipped image (12).  Grouping them further in groups of three or four triangles, I counted another set of (7) and the flip for another (7).  Then I noticed four other ways to group four triangles (3), (3), (3), (3).  Lastly, there are two large triangles composed of the inner sixteen triangles (1) and (1).\n\nAltogether I got seventy (76) triangles.  You can double check my work using the attached image (link 2).  I think I got them all and didn't double count...	Science & Mathematics

Something I've run into a GREAT deal of late. damn hybrid modems !\n\neg. if you DHCP RELEASE and RENEW your Router, it obtains a **WAN** IP of 192.168.0.1 YOU CANNOT USE 192.168.0.X for your **LAN**\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter that the subnet 255.255.255.0 would allow you to......don't do it. Put your Router on a **LAN** IP of something else....like 192.168.2.1\nthen with your PC's on DHCP themselves, Release and Renew them as well.\n\nhope this helps-------------------------------------\n\nin the LAN portion of your Router setup use the IP I gave you. \nif your Router is on  192.168.2.1\nthen YOUR PC needs to either be on DHCP, or \na static ip of\n192.168.2.100\nsubnet mask of\n255.255.255.0\ndefault gateway of\n192.168.2.1\nand dns of\n192.168.2.1\n\nhmmm, if your going to use DHCP for other computers in your house, and you want to use a Static IP for yourself, then use instead IP address 192.168.2.99 for yourself.

[SEP] question_content: i would like to format my computer and remove everything on the pc during the format. but please what is the correct sequence to do this. [SEP] best_answer: You First Have To Insert The Windows XP Disk that came with your PC At Start Up. Once you do that it should say "Press Any Key To Boot From CD". At This Point You Press Any Key.After you do that you will be lead to a blue screen that starts loading a bunch of things. Once it is done loading you have to acsept the licence aggrement from microsoft (I think you press F8 but it will tell what to press). You will then be asked if you would like to repair windows. Cancel and press escape. You Will Then Be shown all the partions on You HardDrive. Delete all the partions (except the unused on). You Have Now Erased the HardDrive. If You Want to install windows again you must create another partion. If you are using only one operating System use the max space alloted. Your new partion will then be formatted. Once that is complete some new files will be written to your hard drive. Now after that is complete your computer will restart and automaticly install windows. From Here all you have to do is pedioticly enter some information (Ex. Name, Time Zone). That Is How Erase A Hard Drive. Note that this could take up to 3 hours. Good Luck.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Do you know anything about CREDIT SCORES? [SEP] question_content: Is it true that Insurance companies Like AUTO, HOME OWNERS insurance, check your FICO score before giving you insurance rate? If so, WHY? what is the correlation between having  bad score, and the insurance rate? I would appreciate any help, and any resources that you can point me too. THank you!! Im doing this for a school project! [SEP] best_answer: Yes and no.  Your beacon score (the number generated by the major credit bureaus) is different from your insurance score (the term used by insurers for the application of credit).  Every company has a proprietary way of reviewing credit and the factors that determine your insurance score will vary from company to company.  Your insurance score can be substantially different from your beacon score, depending upon the weights and factors used by the insurance carrier.  \n\nFor your beacon score, the key factors are things like paying your bills on time and not being maxed out in terms of your debt to availability ratio.  Insurers won't necessarily place the same weight here, and often look at factors like the types of debt you have, the frequency with which you open new accounts, inquiries and collections.  \n\nInsurance companies analyze risk.  The riskier your behaviors (like running up $30,000 in credit card debt) have an overall indicator that someone is less financially responsible than someone who has no debt.  Keep in mind that insurance carriers are looking at the law of large numbers here, as well.  Of course there are great customers with a ton of debt (small business owners, for example), but the state departments of insurance prevent insurance carriers from evaluating on a case by case basis and require that carriers file their credit review procedures. \n\nAlso keep in mind that credit is one of literally dozens of factors that determine premium (like age, driving record and address for auto or location, claims and age of dwelling for home).  There is a direct correlation between having a lower insurance score and the frequency/severity of claims filed.  Interestingly, the correlation is often stronger with regard to auto claims rather than to homeowner's as might be expected.  \n\nInsurance carriers are looking for any statistical data that helps them splice and dice risk.  If they could find evidence that supported saying blondes deserve better rates than red-heads, they'd go with it.  Insurance companies compete any many different levels and the company with the best ability to sort risks out into pricing levels will win in the long run.  \n\nHope this helps!	Business & Finance

question_title: why cant i get a job? the agencies seem to throw away my number the moment i register. how do i get a job??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The process for getting a job is similar to the process for getting a girlfriend: you have to figure out what it is that they want and then give it to them.\n\nPeople who look for jobs are often too self-oriented and they don't do research on the company to understand what the company really needs.\n\nFirst of all jobseekers should understand that a company creates a job because there was a problem that was persistent. If you know what the problem is, then you can position yourself as the solution to that problem. Only then will they give you the job.\n\nGoing to the job market without having a clear solution to offer is never going to work, in the same way that a guy who wants to date women but only thinks of sex and not what he can bring to them, will never get a girlfriend.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci may have been an artistic and scientific genius, but he also did something few job seekers know: in every cover letter he sent to patrons, he would always list 10-15 specific solutions or projects he could do for the employer. He even offers to work for free, so the employer can go for a "free trial"!\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: What is escrow? [SEP] question_content: How does this apply to houses? [SEP] best_answer: 1- What Is Escrow?\nEscrow is a process that provides for a fair and equitable transfer of property from one person to another.\nEscrow opens when the buyer and seller sign a sales contract, commonly called a real estate purchase agreement and receipt of deposit. The contract, along with any additional instructions, serves as instructions for the escrow officer. \nEscrow assures that the lender releases the home purchase funds at or about the same time that the deed is recorded to reflect new ownership. Escrow includes depositing, with a neutral third party, funds, documents and instructions necessary to complete the transfer. \nBecause the real estate transaction involves large sums of money and reams of documentation, escrow is not always a predestined, step-by-step process, but can become a confusing end game of details, nit picking and overlapping procedures. It requires preparation, attention to detail, and desire from both sides to close the deal. \nRegional custom will dictates who (the buyer or the seller) chooses the neutral third party and who that third party will be. A neutral third party can be an escrow officer from an escrow company, someone from a title company or from a title and escrow company. Some regional areas use title and escrow attorneys. Custom and market conditions also dictate which escrow costs the buyer or seller pays. The amount typically totals about 1 to 2 percent of the cost of the home. \nChoosing an escrow officer is much like choosing any real estate professional. Get several referrals from trusted people, then compare services, cost and convenience. \nYour escrow officer opens escrow by assigning your escrow an account number and collecting the contract and other instructions, the buyer's deposit and perhaps additional proceeds or documents related to the transaction. Deposits are either applied to the purchase price, or returned should the deal fall through. \nThe buyer orders title insurance, to protect him or her against blemishes on the title, and he or she orders a preliminary title search to determine if there are any claims against the title. \nThe contract and escrow instructions likely contain contingencies for home insurance, flood insurance, home inspections, financing, repairs and other tasks either the buyer or seller must complete before the transaction can progress. Each time a contingency is met, the buyer or seller signs off with a contingency release form or letter copied to all parties, including the escrow officer. \nAt some point, parties will receive a preliminary title report which summarizes the condition of the title, including easements and liens, claims and encumbrances against the property. The seller must resolve any claims against the title, or they could stall the deal. \nThe title company may check once again and produce a final report to be sure existing claims have been removed and that no claims have been filed since escrow opened. \nOnce the loan is funded, contingencies are released, the title is cleared, the buyer inspects the property and decides how to take title, only a few loose ends must be tied before close of escrow. \nRemaining paperwork to sign a few days before close includes the buyer's grant deed, any final escrow instructions or contingency releases, the settlement sheet of disbursements, title reports, the deed of trust lender forms, inspection reports, tax statements -- and a rental agreement if the seller will live in the home for some time after escrow closes. \nEscrow closes and the deal is sealed when the escrow office records a new deed in the buyer’s name, the seller gets paid for the home, and all other moneys are disbursed. \nMoney may be held in escrow after the close to pay contractors for unfinished work. \ntop	Business & Finance

question_title: What´s your stand in the immigration issue in America? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe that most illegal immigrants that are already in this country should be given a chance to stay (depending their situation)and become legal because after all, most are just trying to make a decent living, some have children who are citizens and deporting them would result in destroying families. As for closing the borders, i agree to this because i believe this country is going to become overcrowded with illegals. The people from Mexico and other countries south of the border should take a stand and try to fix their countries and stop running away from their problems.\nwhy doesn't this country start the process of fixing this situation by jailing those that actually hire illegals to work for them. If illegals see that there are no more jobs for them wount they stop coming and find a way to live and work in their own country?	Politics & Government

question_title: Border walls... Good? or bad?   who is aginst them and why... who thinks they are godd and why?  Reasons GOOD! [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: a. They are a good idea, but they must be built properly. You can't build a 700 mile fence on a border that is over 1,950 miles. You also can't build a fence that is only three feet tall or made out of chain-link, wood- and- post, etc. (There are 5 year olds that can climb over them.) \n*****\nWhat I would do: \na. Height: At least 15 feet. \nb. Fence type: Chain-link fence with razor wire and barbed wire intertwined through it. (Anyone who is stupid enough to try and climb it will get exactly what they deserve.) There will be one wide gate that can be opened to let buses, trucks, cars, etc. through every 25 miles. Also, there should a large slab of concrete wall underneath the fence to prevent tunneling.\nc. Other forms of security: \n1. Cameras wherever the border patrol deems it necessary. \n2. ARMED border patrol agents with vehicles best suited to the rocky desert terrain. They will patrol the border and be stationed at the gates. (They'll check the interior of the buses, trucks, cars, etc.) \n3. Small helicopters to patrol from overhead. \n4. (Hopefully.) Start pulling in U.S. troops and start sticking them on the border. \n5. Force anyone that leaves food, water, and/or medical supplies on the border to leave. Then, take the supplies away. \n\n-Incidentally: Leave about three inches of fencing without wire on the bottom just to make sure that small lizards, etc. won't get cut. I'd also keep a few veterinarians on hand. Also, if Mexico or some "do-gooder" wants to send doctors, fine. Just remind them that: \na. They are going to have to pay for the treatments with their OWN money. \nb. The illegals will be immediately deported when they get bandaged up and ready to start the road to recovery. \nc. Any potential anchor-babies born on U.S. soil would not get an automatic path to citizenship. Instead, they'd get sent back to Mexico with their mother's citizenship. \n*****\nb. Who is against the fence? Illegal immigrants and their relatives. \n\nc. Why is the fence good? It blocks one wave of illegal immigrant from entering the country. After our border is secured, we can start working on deportation, tracking tourists, and on keeping tack of people that have visas. (We must make sure that the latter don't "mysteriously disappear.")

question_title: What are your thoughts on the American Press? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: they are failing to inform Americans of certain dangerous trends in America.\nlike no more religion in school and how this was done and by what type of thinking did we get to this point in America.\nWe have given all our rights over to the state and federal government and this is what happens when you pass laws restricting freedom .WHEN you tell me it is illegal to be in a public place like a park after 10 pm or before 6 am you have opened your self to so many losses of freedom that ,  that type of law makes possible i am ashamed to be an American today .\nWe had people fight and die so that we could be free from oppression and servitude.The right to have representation to ensure the public intrests were served and not taxed without it being for the good of the people.\nTHAT these people would never pass laws that infringed upon the   basic freedoms of all men and the bill of rights describes our freedoms.This does not mean o fifty foot statue of a naked man and woman engaged in intercourse can not be placed in public on my property.\nthis does not mean i can not engage in sexual acts on my property in full veiw of passers by.\nTHIS does not mean that Ican not or should not be deprived of the right to be free.\nto this end you have the right not to buy my services not to have me work for you denie me permission on your property denie me the right to shop in your store and to make it known that you do not approve of my actions and until i come to my senses i am not wanted around.\nyou may say this leads to discrimination but i say it leads to people providing work and food and services to the very type of person that you wish not to support in yopur community and those who wish to help them by giving food and jobs and support can also be included in you freedom to denie sevices to such people as you see fit .\nTHIS however does not give me the right to refuse sevice on account of race religion or sex age marital statues and so on .\nBY making sex in public veiw illegal you have violated that persons rights to do as he wishes and there fore opened your self up to laws being passed to prevent you from doing what you wish . \nBAD community behavior needs to be handled by the people in the community by making live difficult for people wh othrough there actions do not change to meet those standards and it is your right to refuse to help someone for these resons and these reasons alone.Some where in america naked statues and open sexual gratification may be acceptable and in many places it is not so naturaly some one stiggmatized by a community would search out a place that he could live in peace and enjoy freedoms to shop and go where he is accepted .by passing laws against anyplace exsisting where he can do this you risk losing your freedoms also .\nAmerica does not recognize the danger in forbidding gay marriage or many other laws that end freedom and more and more america is becoming a police state.ONLY people who can afford fifty foot fences are free today to do what i have descibed and this is wrong america for what goes on behind closed doors can affect all americans if to many fences go up all of us lose our freedom and the ones behind the fence do as they please secure in there property to act as they will.these were called lords of the manner dukes and so forth with the power and control of the people who the took pleasure in taking from there hard work and goods for the protection of the castle walls.\nHAVE we become so entreched in our own needs and freedoms we have destroyed all freedom and choice i may not agree with a persons right to say what they want like a kid who mentions jesus in a speach at school but i sure do defend her right to do so as well as a man to erect a disgusting statue or fonicate in public as repulsive as i find some behavior it is freedom i find more important then stoping him .ONCEone persons behaviour is questioned it only becomes a matter of time till you too are being denied your freedoms.\nWE	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would believe that the trogan war was a great battle, as far as original battle strategies.

So you will not see these battles in history books.\n\nSun Tzu in the art of war says "Therefore, to gain a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; to subjugate the enemy's army without doing battle is the highest of excellence. \n\nTherefore, the best warfare strategy is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst is to attack a walled city. ? \n\nLaying siege to a city is only done when other options are not available.\n\nIf you like to see more of this check this out . \nhttp://www.sonshi.com/index.html	Politics & Government

question_title: How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called "Core Fusion" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.  \n\nIf you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).  \n\nThere are also the old "standbys" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.  \n\nIf you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines.

Does anyone know the fastest way to lose weight as soon as possible? I'm unable to go to the gym and it's sorta hard for me to get some good excersise! What indoor activities can i do to help me shed the lbs? I live in a two story house so.. please provide me with health tips, health sites etc.. I really appreciate it! thanks a bunch!! [SEP] best_answer: A FEW THINGS TO REMEMBER:\nThe correct way to burn fat and stay healthy is to burn more calories than you consume\nYou need to make sure you are eating healthy foods while still excercising\nIf you have a big appetite drink plenty of water so that you will feel full but not consume calories\nBut you should always eat\nIf you start to skip meals you will only be more hungry at your next meal and probably eat way too much\nRemember, the average persons stomach is as big as a slice of pizza scrunched up into a ball\nSo you shouldnt be putting more food into your stomach than what fits\nAlso, it takes aproximately 15-20 minutes for your brain to realize that you are full\nso eat slower and you will realize sooner when you are not hungry anymore\n\nALSO....\ni found this artical called "50 Habits of "Naturally Thin" People\nHow to get Started:Decide how much you want to loose and see how many calories a day it will take to make it happen by year's end.Then, work into your routines however many of these eating tweaks and exercises you need to achieve your goal.\nSlash 250 cal.s a day to lose about 25 lbs. in a year, Slash 500 cal.s to loose 50 pounds.\nThis is based on a 150-pound person: you may need to cut more/ fewer calories depending on ur weight, age & gender.

question_title: Can multiple sclerosis cause hip pain? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, by the nature in which it affects the central nervous system, MS can present in any way it wants.  Its most common presentation involves blurry vision and sensory changes, but a variety of pain syndromes can be present as well.  Recent study found up to 43% of patients with MS have some form of pain.  Hip pain was not specifically mentioned in the study, but back pain was and one can certainly imagine MS causing hip pain as well.  The important thing, though, would be to absolutely make sure that there is nothing wrong with the hip (fracture, infection, etc).  Your doctor could help you with that.	Health

question_title: Reflux Pain Gallstones??How do you know??Short Time of Fever and Chills..then goes .odd! Pain comes and goes!? [SEP] question_content: I had a bought of 'fever and chills' earlier this evening, then they went away. I called Ttelehealth Ontario on their free 1-800 number. Not much help there, they told me to go to EMERG. Typical answer.\n\nMy urine is not dark, and I took some Ranitidine with milk as I am totally out of Pantoloc and Pariat. No vomiting or nausea. The pain comes and goes under my right rib area, not in my shoulders. I am constantly rubbing the area, I tried an ice pack, and BEN GAY, that remedy just irrates the area in question. It's a strong nasty pain like someone sticking a knife into you, it comes and goes. Caffeine irrates it too, so do Cheezy's or anything spicey, Bad foods that I eat. Yes I am overweight as well, not a drinker but a smoker and am 44 years old and very tall!!\nHelp!! I live in the only modernized city n the world that does NOT have a hospital in the downtown core-Ottawa Canada, very difficult to get to if you dont have a car and live alone. So I suffer at home late at night. [SEP] best_answer: Could very well be gall stones...although gallstones do not usually produce a fever.  Sounds like you have a history of GI problems given the drugs you have available.  It is very possible to have ulcers and/or diverticuli that become infected and cause the type of pain that you describe with fever. The products that are exacerbating the pain would do so with either.  A bad gall bladder will in addition to pain cause flatulence and belching.  You are the right age for either problem.  STOP SMOKING!!!   That is the worst thing you can do if you have stomach problems.  Milk is not good for either gall bladder or ulcerative problems as it increases the production of stomach acid and phlegmy secretions.  Your symptoms do suggest that medical intervention is eminante.  Good luck and God Bless!	Health

question_title: what is xanex used for? What is it in medical terms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Xanax is in the class of drugs called "benzodiazepenes".  It is an anti-anxiety agent effecting GABA production in your brain.  It is not generally useful as an anti-depressant.  Its most effective use if for a biological condition known as Panic Disorder.  People with Panic Disorder may need to take a small daily dose indefinitely in order to function and have a decent quality of life.  When used properly under the guidance of a physician they are actually one of the safer medications on the market as far as lack of bad side-effects, allergies, etc.  Continued use will cause a dependency on the drug, but many people with panic feel that this is a very fair trade-off.

question_title: dose ice cold water help you loose weight? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: actually it will, but it needs to be over time.

question_title: Please help! Antibiotics not helping my prostatitis!!? [SEP] question_content: I took Cipro for 10 days, Septra for 10 days, now doxycycline for 10 days. Each time, things cleared up greatly for a few days, then symptoms returned. I know that sometimes you have to take anti-biotics for 4-12 weeks to get better. Does that mean that my symptoms won't improve for a few weeks and I shouldn't be concerned yet? I'm terrified that I have one of those cases of prostatitis that never goes away. I know this happens sometimes but just don't know if I'm overreacting because it's taking some time to get better. I'm miserable! Pain, no sexual function...I'm basically incapacitated. Has anyone had prostatitis that took a long time to clear up? Please help!! I'm only 32!! [SEP] best_answer: One of the most effective treatment protocols for this problem is a combination of frequent vigorous prostatic massage combined with long term antibiotic therapy. The prostate has a poor blood supply and in order to ensure that a sufficient amount of antibiotics get into this gland, proper drainage is required. Regular massage combined with long term antibiotic treatment should solve this problem.\nIt is most important to ensure that your sexual partner be treated as well. If your partner is a woman, any recurrent yeast infections are a definite sign of her being infected with a non-culturable STD organism. The presence of these organisms can be proven with a PCR (DNA) test.\nIf she has this problem, an effective treatment is oral fluconazol combined with a topical antifungal like terconazol together with a prolonged treatment of a newer tetracycline analogue taken orally. Although macrolide antibiotics (long acting erythromycins) work, they can become problematic when combined with  oral antifungal medications.\nIncidentally, the reason why women develop vulval yeast infections 'down there' is because the mucous membranous lining in that area has lost its integrity from an underlying nanobacterial infection. This type of bug cannot be grown in a typical lab. Keep in mind that yeast is everywhere and opportunistic. Conditions have to be just right before it can make a home anywhere on your body.\nThe unfortunate thing is that a lot of healthcare providers aren't aware of this phenomenom so it's often treated erroneously.\nAlthough the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are very effective, minocycline has been proven to be very safe when used long term.

question_title: What can I do to make myself more desirible to women?? [SEP] question_content: I want to be the guy at the club that girls notice, but I feel like I blend in the club.How can I stand out? \n\nHow do you decide on who to talk to? [SEP] best_answer: Simply put - self confidence.  And don't be afraid to talk to women.  I don't know how many times I will see a guy look at me (By that, I mean LOOK), but won't say anything.  A lot of women are shy, or were taught that they should not approach a guy - to let him approach you.  (My mother taught that a girl should never call a guy first, or approach him.)  I wish that when guys noticed a girl, they would just come up to us and say something (aside from a lame pickup line).  \n\nOh yeah - and you should talk to whoever you feel a connection with.  If you catch someone looking at you, and they kind of grin and look away, go talk to her!	Family & Relationships

question_title: Can you think of any ways I can save time. Or reduce stress.? [SEP] question_content: I work 40 hours a week and single parent. [SEP] best_answer: The most important thing you can do is to get up 15-30 minutes a day earlier than normal, and take that brief time for yourself every day to reflect and plan your day out. This may take some of the urgency out of your daily tasks.\n\nReduce caffeine intake; while it may wake you up, it's a false and fleeting source of energy. Eat as well as you can, and take at least 1 hour per week to do something small you enjoy.\n\nYou didn't mention the age of your child/children. They're demanding little creatures at any age, but know this. Single parent or not, don't let guilt feelings allow you to neglect YOURSELF. An overworked stressed-out mom can hinder the effectiveness of child-rearing. Cherish the small things, and pick your battles.	Family & Relationships

question_title: If both parents are the same  height will the children be the same height, what are your observations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the human genome, humans have a base height that is added to the height genes. so if both parents have half tall genes and half short genes (lets just say T for tall and t for short), like the mother may have TtTTtt and the father may have ttTtTT, the the child may turn out many ways, for example it could receive all three tall genes from the mother and all three tall genes from the father (TTTTTT) or it could receive all three short genes from the mother and all three short genes from the father (tttttt) or it could be any combination in-between.(TTtTtT, TTtTTT, TtttTt,...).  However, if both the parents are have all short genes (both have tttttt) then the only combination possible for the child is tttttt, and the same goes for the tall genes.  There is one more major possibility, but the parents would not be the same height.  If the mother had all short genes (tttttt) and the father had all tall genes (TTTTTT) then the child would have 3 short genes and 3 tall genes (TtTtTt not necessarily in that order).  Also keep in mind that there are more than 6 genes that control height.  And just to screw things all up, height depends on more that genetics (environment, eating habits, sports, injuries...).  To make things more complicated, other genes indirectly affect height.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I know it is the eternal question from guys. But is 5.25 inches a small penis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nWhile there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.\n\nMen are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.\n\nThe truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.\n\nThe truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind – that can be LOTS of fun.\n\nThe truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl’s clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.\n\nBesides – a smaller penis is always easier to swallow than a bigger one.

question_title: Should I dump my girlfriend? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now; we're both 22. She's a sweet girl and all, but recently, she put on a little bit of weight. She used to have a real nice figure. I wouldn't mind so much, but I get a lot of hassle from my male friends and from random people in public places (including other girls). Because of all this hassle, it's getting to the point where I'm a little embarassed to go out with her. I've been pondering for the last month about whether or not I should dump her. There's another girl who's showing tremendous interest in me, and she thinks me and her would be great together. My girlfriend once said that if I ever dumped her, she'd make my life a living hell.\n\nWhat should I do? [SEP] best_answer: i hate men like you, just because your g/f has put on some weight does not mean you have to dump her, who cares what anyone else thinks and says, you dont deserve a gf but its obvious your not intrested in how a women feels or who she is as a person, all your worried about it if she is good looking or not.\nyou are the type of guy that makes men look bad and are only intrested in looks rather then who a person is.

I'm definitely pulling for him to break Sampras' record for most majors won in a career.	Sports

question_title: Was the Lakers trade of Shaq in favor of Kobe one of the biggest sports blunders ever? [SEP] question_content: I mean, look, Shaq virtually guarantees your team will enter the Conference Finals at least. Kobe by himself can't get to the playoffs, Kobe with Phil Jackson can't even make it out of the first round. How could Jerry Buss be so stupid?\n\nI hear all this talk about Shaq wearing down, but the Heat have made it to the Eastern Conference Finals twice. I bet if the Lakers kept him, they would've been serious NBA Finals contenders.\n\nI still don't understand the logic. Shaq has about 2-3 more years left of serious contention. The Lakers gambled for the future and blew that AND the present.\n\nTrade Kobe...I'm telling you Dr. Buss...oh wait, you gave him that contract.\n\nOoops! [SEP] best_answer: I'm a  Laker fan and I can say that trade sucks. No offense, the Lakers need Shaq to win championships. Before, I was a solid Laker fan. Now, I'm like a Spurs fan or a Cavs fan or any team which has great players. I don't hate the Lakers, I'm still a fan, but trading Shaq was not the best idea they ever had. It's going to be a long time since will see again the Lakers as world champs.	Sports

question_title: Do any one pee in pools summer is coming and i think that is gross how many pee in pools? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no way to know.  When people are asked questions about behavior that is widely disapproved of, a large percentage of people lie.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to chemically analyze pool water and get a definitive answer.  That won't work, though, because urine and sweat have almost exactly the same chemical composition.  \n\nYou may take comfort in the fact that urine is sterile when it is passed.  White blood cells roam the surface of your bladder consuming any microbes they encounter.  Although urine is a good medium for bacterial growth, the chlorine in pool water keeps the bacteria from flourishing.  You should be more concerned about not washing your hands before you eat.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: my other backs are leon washington,,jackson,,and lundy ,,my recievers are driver,,coles ,,and chambers,,should i do it? [SEP] best_answer: No way. That trade is pratically T.J. for Gore since Addai is not even worth a roster spot and furry is a nice 4 or 5th receiver. Gore is still one of the top rb's in the game this season. He is your #2 back. Leon washington just a had a huge disappointing week against a weak D. And Lundy still needs to prove he can do that week in and week out. \n\nI still can't believe there are doubters about frank gore. Didn't he prove last week that he is for real. he just ran against the bears for 111 yards. not to mention 90 total yards against the san diego. In both occasions he averaged more than 5 yards per carry. unbeleivable 9.3 yards per carry last week against the great d of the bears. \n\nDon't trade Gore for T.J. He is worth a lot more than him. At this point of the season , I put more value for him than Tiki since tiki is getting all his goaline touches away. With troubles with robinson at goaline , no doubt , frank gore will once again get the carries at the goaline.	Sports

question_title: are there any colleges that offer a surgery program in Georgia? preferbly near Augusta? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: To become a surgeon, and thus practice surgery, one must first get a four year college degree. Then, you go on to medical school, which is another four year program, followed by several years of residency before you can begin practicing as a surgeon.\n\nThus, if you're interested in becomming a surgeon, and don't yet have a college degree, that is your first step. You will want to find a college that has strong science programs, especially in chemistry and biology, although it is not necessary to major in science in order to apply to medical school.\n\nThere are many great colleges in Georgia. A good place to start your college search is: http://gacollege411.org/  There, you'll find a list of colleges in Georgia, plus information about financial aid, preparing to apply to college, and standardized tests.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about becomming a doctor and surgeon, these three sites are jam packed with information about the process of preparing for and applying to medical school:\n\nhttp://prehealth.uchicago.edu/handbook/toc.html\n\nhttp://www.amherst.edu/~sageorge/health.html\n\nhttp://hpap.syr.edu/intsites.htm\n\nIf you're already enrolled in college, I'd suggest you talk with the pre-med advisor at your college who can give you some specific suggestions regarding which medical school in Georgia might be suitable for you.\n\nGood luck!

question_title: i nid tips for saving water(URGENT)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can tell you what we did during the water shortage in Santa Barbara a few years back.  One thing was to fill a two liter bottle of water and place it in each toilet.  that way, the 2 liters stayed in the tank, and only the remainder was washed down, same result, less water.\n\nAnother tip was to put wash basins in each sink, and capture the water to be reused until dirty, and then pour it down the toilet for the next use, instead of flush.  (This is not meant to be bathroom humour).  We switched to using disposable plates and tableware, no dishwashing, except cook pots.\n\nOf course, only do laundry when you have a full washer load.  Or better yet, take the laundry to the laundramat.  Join a health club, or YMCA, and take as many of your showers as you can at the club, instead of home.  One favorite suggestion of young people, is shower with someone, for more efficient use of water.\n\nReplace your lawn with a water efficient landscape.	Education & Reference

So, not that you care but just so you know, if the snow is not too powdery, I might just happen to see your show. ;) (Not that you care, but just so you know and won't freak out or anything if you see me)" [SEP] best_answer: I hear the snow is great this year\nI think I'll come and ski\nAnd if your show has not shut down\nThen in the crowd I'll be!\n\nBut if I'm having too much fun\nEnjoying apres-ski\nI hope you "break a leg" on stage\n...rather you than me!

question_title: stars?...gravity? please help? [SEP] question_content: You and a friend are looking at the stars. your friend says, "stars must always be shrinking because gravity is constantly pulling their particles together." explain what is wrong with your friends reasoning. [SEP] best_answer: Gravity is only half of the picture.\n\nThe stars gravity does tend to pull the stars material towards the center of the star.\n\nHowever, there is also an expansive force - the force of the nuclear fusion reaction that is taking place inside the start.  This reaction creates light, heat, x-rays, cosmic rays and so on.. but it also pushes against the infalling star material, trying to push it back out.\n\nThe balance between gravity and fusion energy is why the star stays (about) the same size.\n\nSometimes gravity wins, and the star compresses all the way town to a neutron star or even a black hole.\n\nSometimes the nuclear reaction wins and the star explodes in a nova or supernova.\n\nMost stars are stable for a VERY long time (billions of years).

question_title: Why does an apple is refered to a kid or learning? [SEP] question_content: I sometimes see an apple along with a student or a kid. [SEP] best_answer: From wikipedia:\n\n"In the United States, Denmark and Sweden, an apple (polished) is a traditional gift for a teacher. This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid, so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food. As apples were a very common crop, teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students. As wages increased, the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit."\n\nSo I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning.	Education & Reference

question_title: How is plastic made? [SEP] question_content: What is plastic made of, like the ingreidents and stuff? [SEP] best_answer: Plastic originates from oil. There are many types of plastic that have different properties for different given situations. First the crude oil and other chemicals are reacted in a reaction tank of some sort and "ploymerized" and peletized. Then this resin is sent to a manufacturer that will take this material and mold it. The material typically comes in pellet form or powder. The molding process will take the material and melt it in an extruder where it conveys through a screw and barrel. It can either be extruded or injection molded. Extrusion is limited to only a constant profile whereas injection molding can create more complex parts. There are however many other processes that plastics can undergo. Such as thermoforming, blown film extrusion, rotomolding, the list goes on...	Education & Reference
question_title: The nuclear fussion process is clean. So, what is meant by the term "dirty bomb"? [SEP] question_content: To wage war is not a clean thought. To clean up after ANY bomb is a devistating task.But for fussion, or fission to occur, requires the physics and math that cannot be less than exact. In the situation in th Middle East, the term "dirty bomb" is used. What would that define in differences between our enemy's bomb and the ones we dropped on Japan more than 60 years ago? [SEP] best_answer: A "dirty bomb" is one that spreads radiation through a conventional (chemical) explosion, not a nuclear one.  In a dirty bomb, a conventional explosive and fusing mechanism are surrounded by highly radioactive material of some sort.\nIt is difficult, and requires a very high degree of mechanical/electrical skill, to construct a nuclear explosive device.  A nuclear (fission) bomb uses conventional explosives fired all at the exact same time to bring together units of fissile material (usually uranium-235 or some isotope of plutonium; there are others), resulting in a "critical mass," or more correctly "prompt criticality" which results in the almost instantaneous release of large amounts of energy.  Fusion bombs (commonly known as H-bombs) use a fission reaction to create the high temperature necessary to start a fusion chain reaction.\nSo, basically, the difference between a "dirty bomb" and a true nuclear bomb is the reaction that creates the explosion.

question_title: What's the meaning of "If I tell lies-------? [SEP] question_content: What's the meaning of "if I tell lies my nose will become longer" and what's ppl stand for?\n\nthank you [SEP] best_answer: ppl stands for people.\n\nYou see, the phrase is meant to tell people not to lie.  It started off with a story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy.  A fairy came along and cast a spell on him; if he wanted to be a real boy, he would have to do something courageous, however, if he lied, his nose would grow longer and it would be very obvious that he lied.\n\nTherefore, in the same way, the phrase is to tell people that if they lie, it would soon be exposed and there's no good in lying, because it would only make yourself look stupid and embarrassed(imagine yourself with a long nose) in front of other people.  \n\n\nBesides, you can't take back your words.

question_title: Does anyone know any way to remember the US Presidents in order?? [SEP] question_content: I know there are a few songs, but does anyone have a long sentence that serves as an acronym or anything of that sort?? Anything will help. Thank you!! [SEP] best_answer: Try walking around your house, or some other place you know well, while you memorize them- walk in a path that you will be able to remember, and try to associate each president, in order, with some place that you know in your house.  Later, when you want to remember them in order, imagine yourself following the same path, and you'll remember the president associated with each location much more easily.\n\nThis is a common technique used by people who memorize things like a deck of cards. It is thought to work because the human brain is very good at memorizing where things are geographically located.	Education & Reference
