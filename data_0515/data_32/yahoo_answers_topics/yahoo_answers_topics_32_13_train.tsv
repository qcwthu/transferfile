question_title: Where is Jesus now? [SEP] question_content: If Jesus really existed and was really resurrected from the dead, where is his physical body now?

[SEP] best_answer: According the Nicene Creed, "He is seated at the right hand of the Father". Whether or not that means in His physical body is a matter of theological speculation.	Society & Culture
question_title: what is Holy grail? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In Christian mythology, the Holy Grail was the dish, plate, bowl, glass, cup or vessel used by Jesus at the Last Supper, said to possess miraculous powers. The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron's Joseph d'Arimathie (late twelfth century) in which Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Great Britain; building upon this theme, later writers recounted how Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him and that in Britain he founded a line of guardians to keep it safe. The quest for the Holy Grail makes up an important segment of the Arthurian cycle, appearing first in works by Chr√©tien de Troyes.[1] The legend may combine Christian lore with a Celtic myth of a cauldron endowed with special powers.\n\nThe development of the Grail legend has been traced in detail by cultural historians: It is a gothic legend, which first came together in the form of written romances, deriving perhaps from some pre-Christian folklore hints, in the later 12th and early 13th centuries. The early Grail romances centered on Percival and were woven into the more general Arthurian fabric. The Grail romances started in France and were translated into other European vernaculars; only a handful of non-French romances added any essential new elements.\n\nSome of the Grail legend is interwoven with legends of the Holy Chalice.

question_title: Is the Church in USA Roman Catholic? What's the relation with the Vatican? [SEP] question_content: I am European. I would like to understand the way the Christian Church is divided in the USA. For instance in Europe you have the Roman Catholics to the West; Protestants in England, Germany etc. and the Orthodox Church to the East. How about in USA?\n\nA good link would do too.\n\nPS: This question is not about faith etc. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I live in a small town in Kansas; right in the center of the USA.  Our population is under 30,000 people.\n\nWe have:\n\n2 Jewish synagogues\n1 Muslim Temple\n1 Pagan sanctuary\n6 Roman Catholic Churches\n4 Baptist churches\n5 (that I know of) Covens (Wiccan)\n5 Protestant churches\n1 Jahovah's Witness' meeting hall\n1 Irish Catholic church\n1 Seventh Day Adventist church\n3 Lutheran churches\n2 Jesus' Christ of Later Day Saints churches\n2 Non-denominational Christian churches\n2 Korean/Christian churches\n2 All Faith religious Centers (catering to any/all religions)\n2 Mormon Churches\n1 Bahai group\n2 New Age Metaphysical groups\n1 Church of Satan\n...  and easily 10 more churches/worhip places which, honestly, I don't know who attends.\n\nI've actually looked for a complete list of churches in Kansas, but can't find one.  There are literally thousands, of varieing faiths.  For all the variety of faiths practicing openly in Kansas, Kansas is, itself, accepted as being one of the more conservative states in our Union.\n\n  \nYou're getting the idea that we really do have a large mix of faiths/spirital practictioners in any area of the USA.  While any given religion might not actually be accepting of another; we do reasonably well at tolerating, if nothing more, people of other faiths.  And tentions/hostilities which do exist are generally demonstrated more covertly than overtly.\n\nSpecifically to Catholicism:  The Roman Catholic Churches in the USA are a bit at odds with The Vatican.  They don't adhere to Papal authority as much as The Vatican would like, and, with some frequency, are threatened with ex-communication.\n\nI hope that gives you some insight into how things work here.  Thanks.	Society & Culture
question_title: I want to know if there are Seventh-day Adventists over there? [SEP] question_content: How do you find life as an Adventist? where's your church located? thank you very much. Have a blessed day! [SEP] best_answer: My whole family are seventh Day Adventists. I grew up SDA and personally found that it changed my life.\n\nGrowing up I had no idea of anything I just believed what I was told. Later on when I was a teenager I started asking questions about Life, God, the Bible, etc. I finally came to my own conclusions about it all and left the SDA's and all other religions. \n\nI personally have found the SDA to be a bit on the strange side. I mean the "branch davidians" branched from SDA and we'll all saw what happened at Waco. Not that all SDA people are wierd, because my family is pretty normal, but I find the teachings to be odd and I wonder why people just follow blindly.\n\nAnyway, whatever you're looking for I'm sure you'll find it and if its right for you, then good.

question_title: Why do Christians keep pushing the lie that the book of job speaks about dinosaurs? [SEP] question_content: Supposedly comes from Job 40:15 - 24. Aside from the obvious fact that man and dinosaurs never existed at the same time, they claim that the phrase "His tail sways like a cedar" means that only dinosaurs had tails like that. However, the problem is that anyone that has at least the most basic understanding of English will notice that "sways like a cedar" means the movement is like the movement a cedar has, not that the tail physically resembles a cedar. Either way, what dinosaur has ever had a tail that looks like this: http://universe-review.ca/I10-22a-cedar.jpg\n\nSo why do you keep pushing this ignorant lie?\n\n(PS. I know someone will say about dinosaur blood found in montana; that is false. They found tissue, but they didn't find ANY red blood cells. And even if they did, that doesn't porve they existed at the same time as humans.) [SEP] best_answer: The correct answer, of course, is that ignorant lies are necessary to the defense of the religion. \n\nWhy would you expect honesty of someone whose goal is to defend a religious belief system?

question_title: When will science prove evolution? [SEP] question_content: If you trully believe in science and not GOD, why hasn't anything evolved in 10,000yrs? Also if you do believe in evolution then show me some form of bacteria (or whatever) that will turn into a fish, grow legs and arms,turn into a furry monkey, make fire, straighten out its spine to walk upright, and talk to me.

Because those of us who do KNOW(believe in) GOD would never, well you know evolutionist. Some of you are just dumb and want to say something for the hell of it. If you can believe in evolution why not aliens? Bacteria can be found all over the earth, why not distant planets? If life formed for us in that way then there must be aliens?! If you can't believe that then there is no such thing as evolution!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] best_answer: the problem is that history can not be proven. science deals with the now. right now we have fossils and bones. what does this mean? that somthing lived and died not that they evolved over millions of years. if the biologists knew anything about astronomy they would realize that the earth is slowing down (hence the leap second) and if somthing is slowing down that means it used to be going faster. and if you do the math on this billions of years ago the earth was going so fast that day and night were one and nothing could stand on its surface.\n\nlets think for ourselves and not let the government or our textbooks tell us what to beleive \ngalleleo along with almost every other inventor would have never made there discoverys had it not been for there mistrust of textbooks.

question_title: When theists say things like how could a watch create its self can they prove it couldn't have? [SEP] question_content: When theists say that how could (name of something manmade) create its self I wonder just how many of them could prove it couldn't have happened on its own without saying because they know it is man made. [SEP] best_answer: Just something to think about: the watchmaker analogy is old, but it does not make sense. A higher power made the watch. It is orderly and perfect in order to work properly. On the same note, if a higher power made the world/nature wouldn't it be orderly and perfect as well? Nature is chaotic and unpredictable. \n\nA watch is proven to be made by man, a physical being that can be touched and felt. Nature has no physical touchable creator that can be proven to be real. There are plenty of logical theories that can be used to explain why nature is how it is. But many people overlook this because they want to believe something more. \n\nThe watchmaker analogy does not hold up logically. I hope that helps?	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: simply put, it is true that we should have freedom but most people that are advocates of 'freedom' in all its forms forget that having freedom is not one-sided.  freedom's twin is 'responsibility'.  one's freedom ends when it starts to encroach on another's.  freedom should be viewed in the correct perspective.  rules and regulations and norms are in place to enforce some sort of order.  but better than rules and regulations are PRINCIPLES.  when we know, have and practice the correct set of principles (which can be summarized into two: love God with all our heart, soul, mind, strength; and love our neighbor as ourselves) then we are able to live responsibly and know the limitations of our freedom.

question_title: supposedly in the bible it says races should not mix if so exactly where and what scripture and verse? [SEP] question_content: if anyone knows please answer [SEP] best_answer: Does the Bible state certain people should not exist?\n\nSatan is brilliant when it comes to orchestrating deception. He has managed to persuade people to make problems when there need be none. No more effectively has He did this than with "race." Satan has deceived people into making "race" a problem by simply defining it as one. The premise usually goes something like this: "God never intended the mixing of the races." The inference is that there are four distinct races and that being in any group other than one of those distinct four "races" constitutes a genetic and aesthetic disadvantage. A person (influenced by Satan) makes the statement, convinces himself that it represents God's point of view and then connects "imagined" negative consequence to what he despairingly terms "race mixing." Since God is supposedly behind the argument, if you or I disagree with the premise, we are disagreeing with God! Who would dare disagree with God? Of course the Bible points out that many will come in Christ's name saying Christ is the Christ and deceive many (Matt. 24:4-5). And, they will kill you and think they do God a service. So, we had better ask ourselves if these ideas really represent God? \n\nThe holder of the argument goes about gathering "data" to support his premise. He usually finds what He is looking for. If evidence doesn't exist he can always "define" it into existence. "Look at the 'race' riots. Look at the 'racial' problems that exist all around the world. Blacks kill whites and whites kill blacks. Therefore, there is a race problem." The average non-thinking person usually swallows this argument. However, if it was pointed out that "blacks" kill "blacks" and "whites" kill "whites" that might infer that "race" was not the causative factor. Killing and hatred are not confined to "racial types." Japanese kill Japanese as do Germans kill Germans. Hatred it seems is not the exclusive domain of "race." Cain killed Abel. What did that have to do with "race?"	Society & Culture

question_title: Does anyone know who translated the Jehovah Witness bible The New World translation of the Holy Scriptures? [SEP] question_content: I have asked Jehovah Witnesses over the years that question and it seems that they themselves don't know. They usually respond that they don't want to give glory to man by revealing that. I want to know who to hold accountable for their outright deceptive translations of John 1: and Heb 1: where the wording has been changed to make Jesus out to not be God as in the original language of the New Testament. [SEP] best_answer: During a court trial in Glasgow, Scotland in 1954, Franz was asked by the Government lawyer just who the translators were. Franz replied under oath: "That is an absolute secret. It will never be revealed now or even after death." Only someone with something to hide would be so intent on secrecy. He was asked: "What happens if somebody submits a translation. Does the committee examine it? Mr. Franz: No. I give it my 0.K., then the President, Mr. N. H. Knorr, has the last word." He was further asked to explain how "translations and interpretations of the Bible were made." Franz replied that they emanated from God: "passed to the Holy Spirit who, invisible, communicates with Jehovah's Witnesses - and the publicity department." (Franz is the head of the Publicity Department).\n\nI found this::  evidently a comittee\nC. The NWT translators were: Nathan Knorr, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, Fred Franz, M. Henschel\n\n    * "Fred Franz however, was the only one with sufficient knowledge of the Bible languages to attempt translation of this kind. He had studied Greek for two years in the University of Cincinnati but was only self-taught in Hebrew." ["Crisis of Conscience"; by Raymond Franz; Commentary Press, Atlanta; 1983 edition; footnote 15; page 50.]\n    * Four out of the five men on the committee had no Hebrew or Greek training at all. They had only a high school education. Franz studied Greek for two years at the University of Cincinnati, but dropped out after his sophomore year. When asked in a Scotland courtroom if he could translate Genesis 2:4 into Hebrew, Franz replied that he could not. The truth is that Franz was unable to translate Hebrew or Greek.\n    * What we are left with is a very inexperienced translating committee that twisted Scripture to make it fit the Society's doctrine.\nhttp://www.bible.ca/Jw-NWT.htm	Society & Culture

Please state your race and country first then state whether you would etc and are there any races you wouldn't like to date for any reasons? Just for interest really. [SEP] best_answer: Australian, um Australia - I would date anyone if I liked their personality etc.  I think there has to be some mutual respect for each other, and respect for difference of opinion.  If we can love, accept and respect each other, and get along most of the time, then I would date anyone from any race, there's none that I would exclude totally, as everyone even within small regions is different!

Sure, money and house and food and all of that stuff, but he was never there when I made that A or when I was valedictorian in 6th grade...

question_title: Why doesn't starch give a positive glucose test? [SEP] question_content: I know so far that starch has an adehyde group but it is too small in comparison to the rest of its own molecule. The experiment used benedict's solution to determine wheter there was a reaction of glucose or not. Starch did not give a positive glucose test. Why? [SEP] best_answer: A starch molecule is made up of 100's of glucose monomers. And each glucose monomer in a starch is linked with another glucose monomer by alpha -1,4 linkage due to which a starch molecule does not have a free aldehyde group which is opresent in a free glucose molecule. At its end it may have a free aldehyde group, but is too small in amount to show the reaction in comparision to a huge glucose monomer. As Benedict's Test is a test to determine presence or absence of a aldehydic group; a starch molecule can not show a positive glucose test. But if a starch molecuse is hydrolysed with help of an acid or amylase enzyme it will certainly show hte positive glucose test.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the best peripheral IV site for giving IV contrast dye for chest angiograms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Generally IV's are started at the most peripheral site that is available and appropriate for the situation. This allows cannulation of a more proximal site if your initial attempt fails. If you puncture a proximal vein first, and then try to start an IV distal to that site, the fluid may leak from the injured proximal vessel. The preferred site in the emergency department is the veins of the forearm, followed by the median cubital vein that crosses the antecubital fossa. In trauma patients, it is common to go directly to the median cubital vein as the first choice because it will accommodate a large bore IV and it is generally easy to catheterize. In circumstances where the veins of the upper extremities are inaccessible, the veins of the dorsum of the foot or the saphenous vein of the lower leg can be used. In circumstances in which no peripheral IV access is possible a central IV can be started.\n\n*** NO NO NO no central line for just IV contrast.  You've got to be kidding me!!!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How to tighten a screw? [SEP] question_content: When assembling a product I was always taught to tighten one screw at a time unless you are aligning two pieces with multiple screws.  Does anyone knowof any technical papers out there for the best practices? [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what you are putting together.. For some things, it's not important if you screw in all sides evenly.  However for other things that require proper alignment for functionality and ease of construction putting the screws in equally is important.  For example, when you put on a tire for a car, you should put the nuts on evenly (opposite nuts in) so that the wheel remains balancedwhen you drive.  But if you are simply puttng one board to another that does not require balance for the object to function (like wallboard) then it really doesn't matter.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what does metabolite mean? [SEP] question_content: it seems that there's "metabolite 1" and "metabolite 2" . what's the difference? [SEP] best_answer: A metabolite is any molecule that is produced in a metabolic pathway carried out in living cells, starting with a particular substrate and driven by some number of enzymes essential to completion of the pathway.  For example, the complete metabolism of the glucose molecule is driven by a large number of critical enzymes and coenzymes that produce a number of metabolites in the pathway leading to the end products, water, carbon dioxide, and ATP (the cell's chemical "money").\n\nWhen you speak of metabolite 1 and metabolite 2 you are probably referring to primary and secondary metabolites.  Primary metabolites are molecules that are essential to the normal growth, development, and reproduction of the organism.  Secondary metabolites may also have important functions, but are not necessarily essential.  Examples of secondary metabolites are pigment molecules in plants and animals and the substances produced by various fungi that act as antibiotics.\n\nAll of the biochemical reactions that take place in living cells make up the cell's metabolism.  In some pathways, described as catabolic, large molecules are subdivided into smaller ones, usually with the release of energy stored in the large molecule (e.g. glucose).  In other pathways, called anabolic, smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones (e.g. the formation of functional proteins from a directed sequence of their constituent amino acids.\n\nAll chemicals that enter the human body as drugs or environmental contaminants are by definition not strictly necessary for the normal function of the body.  Such chemicals may have direct effects on the body's normal physiology without any metabolic conversion.  The most familiar example of such a chemical might be ethanol, the effects of which are known to anyone who's ever taken a drink.  Other drugs and chemicals may also have direct active effects.  On the other hand, many drugs and chemicals must be converted into an active form before they can have a  physiological effect.  For example, the carcinogen vinyl chloride must be converted into chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, which have the capacity to bind to and alter nuclear DNA, for the carcinogenic effect to occur.\n\nConversion of "foreign" parent molecules into active or inactive metabolites takes place in primarily in the liver.  Liver cells contain a vast array of enzyme systems which have apparently evolved with our species to protect us from the harmful effects of potentially toxic chemicals in our food and in the general environment.  The primary effect of these enzyme systems, such as the cytochrome P450 system, is to convert potentially toxic chemicals into relatively harmless metabolites, which are then frequently conjugated with another molecule, such as glucuronic acid, making it easier for the body to excrete the metabolites via the urine.  Again, sometimes the metabolites produced by one of these enzyme systems may be more toxic than the parent molecule; or the parent molecule given as a medication does not become active until it has been processed by a liver enzyme system.  Ethanol is another example here; one of its metabolites, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than the parent alcohol molecule.  Usually acetaldehyde is rapidly converted to carbon dioxide in water; many East Asian people are deficient in the enzymes needed to process acetaldehyde, and so have a much more limited tolerance for alcohol than non-Asians.\n\nOne final note:  it is usually the products of metabolism of  many drugs that may be detected in a person's urine.  This is true for most illicit drugs and also for tobacco.  Each drug produces a characteristic metabolite or metabolites that are present in the urine for some period of time after ingestion of the drug.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: I have heard that all living organisms from polar bears to penguins contain DDT in their bodies. How come? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a number of things to consider:\n1) Persistence - the time chemical substance remain in the ecosystem before degrading.  Elements are persistent in the extreme, most do not change during the lifetime of the solar system.  They only change by nuclear processes (fission or fusion).  Some organic substances, such as DDT, persist for decades or centuries simply because there are no efficient mechanisms for their degradation. \n\n2) Bioaccumulation - does the substance accumulate in the the tissues of organisms exposed in the environment due to \na) biocenentration - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in the organism that in the environment (i.e. higher in fish tissue than in the water they swim in) and \nb) biomagnification - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in organisms higher up the food chain (higher trophic levels).  There are some substances that bioconcentrate in fish, but do not biomagnify because the things that eat the fish can efficiently metabolize the substance.  \n\n\nand 3) Transportation/exposure - the tendency of substance move from the location it is released in the ecosystem.  More volatile substances are more easily transported around the globe (hence the many problems associated with mercury).  Give a long enough lifetime, most things will be cycled throughout the global ecosphere (to the poles, oceans, all land masses, etc.). \n\nThere are a handful of POPs (persistent organic pollutants-- of which DDT is one of the most infamous, see http://www.pops.int) which persist in the environment for decades or centuries.  The key to minimizing the risk from these substances is to stop their release into the environment so that even the very slow degradation can eliminate them from the ecosystem.\n\nTo sum up, DDT (and other POPs) is very persistent, it bioaccumulates up the food chain (so high-level predators like eagles and polar bears have higher concentrations in their tissues) and is fairly easily transported.

question_title: is the world a colder place today then in the 1930's? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, temperatures are going up due to Global Warming.\n\nCO2 is 30% higher than it has been for 650,000 years. Methane is 130% greater. These are two of the main pollutants humans put into the atmosphere in excess, and they are two of the primary greenhouse gases.\n\nLook at the 'hockeystick', which shows a dramatic warming since 1950 after a fairly stable climate for 1000 years. In fact, the 10 hottest years in recorded history have all happened since 1990, with 2005 being the hottest, and 2006 is shaping up to maybe break that record.\n(see links below)\n\nHow's that for proof of man's fault in this? There is ample proof, any real scientist will tell you that.\n\nThere has NEVER been an article doubting man's influence on global warming published in a peer-reviewed journal. A recent study of almost 1000 proved that.\n\nYes, the earth naturally heats and cools, but the rate and amount we are warming now is unprecedented in the recent geologic past. We are doing this, and we must stop it. This is not some political statement or rhetoric. This is science trying to educate a crass, ignorant public of the damage they are doing. The magnitude of temperature increase ALREADY is about 10x that of the 'little ice age' of the middle ages, and rate and amount are only going up. \n\nJust to be clear, glacial and interglacial cycles are mainly controlled by astronomical fluctuations, but we have a detailed record of the last 7 cycles, and what the climate and CO2 is doing now is way different and extreme. The rate of increase is much higher than in the past AND the value itself is much higher.\n\nHI CO2: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4467420.stm\nHOCKEY STICK: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5109188.stm\nGeneral climate stuff: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3897061.stm	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the difference between a CARDIAC ARREST & a HEART ATTACK? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They are not the same.\n\nCardiac arrest is when a heart stops beating / contracting. That is when you give a CPR and either shock the heart or give appropriate drugs to treat it.\n\nHeart attack is when the heart muscles die as a result of not getting enough blood supply. Here you give drugs directed to improve the blood supply of the heart. In most cases the heart keeps beating after the heart attack. But rarely, if many of the muscle fibers are dead, the person's heart stops beating too. In those cases, cardiac arrest happens as a result of heart attack.\n\nHope its clear to you now.

question_title: How many integers between 1 an 1000000 have the sum of their digits equal to 18? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can show that the answer is 25927 without using computer.\n\n\nFirst, we can ignore 1000000 since its sum of digits is not 18. Also, let's add 0's in front of numbers to have 6 digits if the number has less than 6 digits. So our range is going to be from 000001 to 999999.\n\nNumber of partition of 18 into 6 whole number is\n(18+6-1)C(6-1)=(23)C(5). Assign these 6 numbers to the 6 digits.\n\nNow, we need to remove the cases where one digit is 10 or bigger. It is very good thing that two digits cannot be 10 or bigger, as the sum would go over 18.\n\nLet one digit has x, where x>=10. The sum of the other 5 digits is 18-x. Since 18-x is partitioned into 5 whole numbers, we have (18-x+4)C(4) possible ways. This should be multiplied by 6 since the big digit can be the first digit, second digit, ..., sixth digit. x is from 10 to 18. So we need to calculate 6((12)C(4) + (11)C(4) + .... + (4)C(4)).\n\nSince (n)C(m)+(n)C(m+1)=(n+1)C(m+1), we get\n(4)C(4) + (5)C(4) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((5)C(5) + (5)C(4)) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((6)C(5) + (6)C(4)) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n...\n=(13)C(5). (This shows beauty of mathematics, doesn't it?)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (23)C(5)-6*(13)C(5)=25927.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the symbiotic relationship between beetle larvae(mealworms) and protozoa in their digestive tract? [SEP] question_content: This is for a Bio experiment, please help. [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the specific protozoa; if for example both the mealworm and the protozoa benefit from the relationship (the protozoa has a nice place to live and feed and the mealworm benefits from the protozoa breaking down other organic matter in the mealworms digestive system) it would be a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.  If, however, the protozoa is using the mealworm as a host carrier in its life cycle as a staging area to propagate itself, lay eggs, or feed on until it is deposited somewhere and it negatively affects the health of the mealworm, it is a parasitic relationship (the protozoa being the parasite).

question_title: why are there 60 seconds in a minute and not a number llike 10 or 100? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You can blame the ancient Babylonians who had a base-60 (sexagesimal) system for counting.\n\nThey liked 60 because it is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6... and it can also be divided by ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty. \n1/2 hr = 30 minutes\n1/3 hour = 20 minutes\n1/4 hour = 15 minutes\n1/5 hour = 12 minutes\n1/6 hour = 10 minutes\n\nIn addition to using base sixty, the Babylonians also made use of six and ten as sub-bases. \n\nTo this day, we bear the legacies of almost every number system our ancestors experimented with. From the duo-decimal systems we have twenty-four hours in a day, twelve inches in a foot, and special words such as dozen (meaning 12) and gross (meaning 12 x 12 = 144). \n\nFrom the Babylonians‚Äô sexagesimal system we have sixty seconds in a minute, sixty minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle, where 360 degrees is derived from the product of the Babylonian's main base (sixty) and their sub-base (six); that is, 60 x 6 = 360.\n\nThe French at one time tried to mandate a base-10 time system, (10 hours in a day, 100 minutes per hour), but it never caught on.  So like much of the weirdness of our 3 ft / yd, 1760 yd. / mile, 8 oz / cup, etc. we have to live with numbers that aren't all based on 10.  I wish it were so, but it isn't.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: will anyone give me the historic sequence how and what make the avogadro to derive the hypothesis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The name "Avogadro's Number" is just an honorary name attached to the calculated value of the number of atoms, molecules, etc. in a gram mole of any chemical substance. Of course if we used some other mass unit for the mole such as "pound mole", the "number" would be different than 6.022 x 1023. \n\nThe first person to have calculated the number of molecules in any mass of substance was Josef Loschmidt, (1821-1895), an Austrian high school teacher, who in 1865, using the new Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) calculated the number of molecules in one cubic centimeter of gaseous substance under ordinary conditions of temperature of pressure, to be somewhere around 2.6 x 1019 molecules. This is usually known as  "Loschmidt's Constant."  (This value, no, is now listed at the NIST web site as 2.686 7775 x 1025 m-3)\n\nWhen was the first time the term "Avogadro Number" was used?  The designation seems to originate in a 1909 paper entitled "Brownian Movement and Molecular Reality."  by Jean Baptiste Jean Perrin (b. Lille, France, 30.9.1870-d. New York, 17.4.1942.)  This paper was translated into English from the French in Annals De Chimie et de Physique by Fredric Soddy and is available.  Perrin, was the 1926 Nobel Laureate in Physics for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium.  Perrin should be very well known to anyone who does calculations in molecular dynamics.  Most of these methods were developed by Perrin.   In his paper Perrin says "The invariable number N is a universal constant, which may be appropriately designated "Avogadro's Constant." \n\nIn the presentation of his Nobel prize in 1926 it was said of the work of Perrin:  \n\nIt may perhaps be said that in the work which we have just summarized Perrin has offered indirect evidence for the existence of molecules. Here, follows a direct evidence. Microscopic particles in a liquid are never at rest. They are in perpetual movement, even under conditions of perfect external equilibrium, constant temperature, etc. The only irrefutable explanation for this phenomenon ascribes the movements of the particles to shocks produced on them by the molecules of the liquid themselves. A mathematical theory of this phenomenon has been given by Einstein. The first experimental proof of this theory was given by a German physicist, Seddig. After him, the problem was taken up by two scientists simultaneously. One of them was Perrin; the other Svedberg. I have to speak of Perrin only. His measurements on the Brownian movement showed that Einstein's theory was in perfect agreement with reality. Through these measurements a new determination of Avogadro's number was obtained. \n\nThe molecular impacts produce not only a forward movement of the particles distributed in a liquid, but also a rotational movement. The theory of this rotation was developed by Einstein. Measurements in relation herewith were carried out by Perrin. In these measurements he has found another method for determining Avogadro's number. What then is the result of these researches ? How many molecules are there in two grams of hydrogen? The three methods have given the following answers to this question: 68.2 x 1022; 68.8 x 1022; 65 x 1022.\n\nThe work of Einstein and Perrin gave some of the first concrete evidence for the existence of molecules, entities many still did not recognize even into the early 1900's.   And Avogadro's Number has a value that must be measured experimentally.    Subsequent to the work of Loschmidt and Perrin many scientists carried out many experiments using a variety of techniques to arrive at the most accurate value for this the number of molecules in one mole of substance.  And by 1933 there was still no universal agreement as to what the number should be called.  In a paper entitled "Loschmidt's Number", publi	Science & Mathematics
question_title: a hiker descended 1000 feet down a mountain in 30 minutes. whatis the best estmateofhis rate of descent? [SEP] question_content: A. 2,000 ft/h\n\nb. 1,500 ft/h\n\nc. 750 ft/h\n\nd. 100 ft/h [SEP] best_answer: The answer is A. You mean to tell me you couldn't figure this out for yourself?\n\nHere's how it's done.\n\n1. The unit of measure is feet per hour (ft/h).\n\n2. There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n3. 30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes, which is an hour, as mentioned in #2 above.\n\n4. Since you multiplied 30 minutes by 2, you should likewise multiply 1000 feet by 2. 1000 feet x 2 = 2000 feet. There's your answer. Got it?	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Can "any humanbeing"can touch the stars...? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Stars are massive, glowing balls of hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium. Some stars are extremely hot, while others are cooler. You can tell by the color of light that the stars give off. If you look at the coals in a charcoal grill, you know that the red glowing coals are cooler than the white hot ones. The same is true for stars. A blue or white star is hotter than a yellow star, which is hotter than a red star. Temperature of stars range in the high hundreds to thousands degrees F. So to touch the stars that are in the sky is almost impossible, as your body would burn due to high temperatures surrounding them.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Are people made from Stardust? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nIt is now thought (and even more radio telescope survey evidence on this has just come in) that at the very beginning of things (the Big Bang) there was nothing but energy. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles were formed from that energy, and some time later, things cooled enough for atoms to form and stay together. Since it takes force to push protons together (to form nuclei of the higher atomic number atoms), and the force wasn't available, only hydrogen (and a very small amount of helium and perhaps an even smaller amount of lithium -- the simplest atoms) resulted.\n\nLots of hydrogen, distributed in a sort of clumpy manner, will eventually collapse into stars. Large stars burn through their available fuel relatively quickly, all the while forcing together protons into more complex atoms such as carbon and oxygen and silicon, and so on. When these large stars go nova, they spray a good part of themselves into interstellar space where the material is incorporated into newly forming stars or collected into clouds around them. As those clouds collapse into planets (which must be very common as we have now seen some hundreds of them around stars in the local area in our galaxy (ie, within a few hundred light years)), the non-hydrogen material in them is actually star stuff. Probably not really dust particles in most cases, but...\n\nAnd that's how it was. Fascinating stuff.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why wont my hp 1315 3 in 1 printer accept refilled ink cartridge? [SEP] question_content: why wont my hp 1315 3 in 1 printer accept refilled ink cartridge [SEP] best_answer: Your printer has a memory on it.   The printer remembers the last three cartridges that have been installed, and thus is remembering your cartridge as being empty.\n\nIf you have some empties kicking around or know somebody that does, just install and remove them in sequence with your refilled cartridge being the fourth and final.  \n\nHopefully that will clear it up.  \n\nHowever if you are getting a blinking light and a "please check cartridge" warning then unfortunately the cartridge is done.

When I print a picture and it have black in it the outline of the black is yellow\n\nP.S. I have done Nozzle checks and the Nozzle check comes out good. [SEP] best_answer: your nozzle check is good.  Run a couple cleanings on it.  then check again.\n\nYou may have a priming issue with the bulk ink systems.  Epsons always need a little ink to remain inside the print head in order for them to print.   If the system is drawing back in after a print then you will have a void in the print head resulting in a lack of print.\n\nDo a few nozzle cleaning since those tend to use a little ink do your nozzle checks as well.  Trying printing immediately after wards.   Do a couple pages to see if there is improvement.  If that works then you have huge problem with the bulk ink system.  One that will eventually damage the print head beyond repair.	Computers & Internet

question_title: i want 2 write my name at  START (left bottom on d system)? [SEP] question_content: in window syatems there is START on d left bottom side, i want 2 write my name on this [SEP] best_answer: 1. Download Resource Hacker.\n\n2. Locate explorer.exe in your C:/Windows directory. Copy this file somewhere and give it the name explorer.bak.\n\n3. Launch resource hacker and use resource hackers menus to open up explorer.exe. Once opened you will see a lot of collapsed folders.\n\n4. Expand the String Table folder and then find folder No. 37 (folder No. 38 if you're in Windows Classic mode).\n\n5. Click on resource 1033 and locate the text that says 'start.' This is your Start button, Change the 'start' text to your text of choice. You don't have a character limit, but the text takes up valuable taskbar space, so don't make it too long.\n\n6. Click on the button labeled Compile Script. This updates the settings for your Start button. But nothing will happen until you complete through step #20, so keep going!\nIf you just want to change the text and nothing else like hover text, image, etc. jump to step 16.\n\nChange your hover text\n\n7. While you're here, why not also change the text that pops up when your mouse hovers over your Start button?\n\n8. Right now it says 'Click here to begin.' Well, duh! We already know that's where to begin!\n\n9. Open folder No. 34 and click on resource 1033.\n\n10. Find the text that says 'Click here to begin' and change it to something cooler.\n\n11. Click on the Compile Script button to update this resource.\n\nCustomize your Start icon\n\n12. For an added bonus, you can also change the Windows icon to the left of the text, too.\n\n13. Collapse the String Table folder and expand the Bitmap folder at the top of your folder list.\n\n14. Click on folder No. 143 and click on resource 1033. You should see that familiar Windows icon.\n\n15. Go to the Action Menu and select 'Replace bitmap.' Select 'Open file with new bitmap', and locate the replacement image on your machine. Note: The image must have a .bmp extension and a size of 25 pixels by 20 pixels. Then click the Replace button.\n\nMake your new Start button active\n\n16. Now that you've made your changes, save the file in your Windows folder with another name, such as explorer1.exe. Don't name it Explorer.exe, because that file is already being used by your system.\n\n17. Now that we have created a new Explorer1.exe file we need to get Windows to use it. That‚Äôs where the Registry editor comes in. Click on your "start" button and then click "RUN". Now type "regedit" and click the "OK" button to open the registry editor.\n\n18. In the registry editor go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92; SOFTWARE&#92; Microsoft&#92; Windows NT&#92; CurrentVersion&#92; Winlogon". Once there double click on the string value "Shell". Once inside the text box will have "explorer.exe" in it, delete that and type in "explorer1.exe", (what we saved the new explorer file as) then click the "OK" button.\n\n19. Make sure explorer1.exe is in the "C:&#92;Windows&#92;" directory otherwise you will have to type the whole path ito the text box.\n\n20. Now reboot your computer and enjoy your new start button!

question_title: Why do our mothers drive us nuts? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mothers want what is best for you.  They think they know, and they know a lot, but they don't know everything.  That is why they drive us nuts.  They love us soooo much and want what is best for us to the point that it makes us crazy.  They want us to not make the mistakes they made and they don't want to see qualities that they do not like in themselves in us.  So that makes it a battle between their will for us and our will. Trust me we are driving them nuts too!	Business & Finance
question_title: what is the appropriate rent increase for a commercial property in San Bernardino County per year? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my experience the average rent/contract price increase from year to year is in the range of 4%-6%.  However, you must factor in that you are in the San Bernardino area, which I am under the impression is a good place to be.  So you may want to add a couple more percentage points.  I would not recommend going above 10%.	Business & Finance
question_title: What is the difference between a modular and a true modular? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Interesting question! I've never heard the term "true" modular.\n\nA modular home is one that's built in a factory, and trucked to the building site. It does not have wheels or a chassis, and is of a construction similar to "stick built" on-site construction.\n\nThe modular home typically comes in at least two units (modules), for a standard ranch house. I own a modular custom-colonial two-story, and it came in 10 units.\n\nOnce the modular home is installed on the foundation ("set" in industry terms) it cannot be moved.\n\nThis is all in contrast to a "mobile" home, which is built on a chassis, has permanent wheels, and can be moved at any time.\n\nYou might be thinking of a "manufactured" home, which is essential a mobile home without the wheels, and is typically one-piece.

question_title: love my job but got offer at competing company w/ 25% raise, how do i approach counter offer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You should not counter offer them. Asking for more than 25% raise wouldn't give them good impression of you. (If that is what you mean by counter offer) If you want to stay where you are at, (make sure the offer is genuine) tell your current employer you got 25% raise at the other company. If they really value you, they should at least try to match. If they don't, you can still leave.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The economy has been doing well for several years.

When it is going poorly, people tend to vote for change.	Business & Finance

question_title: What's the E Commerce ...? [SEP] question_content: What's Your Opinion ... Profits ... Disadvantages ...  Which Level is Your Country in ? [SEP] best_answer: What is E-Commerce.\nElectronic Commerce (E-Commerce) is simply any business transacted electronically.\nIn today's parlance it has come to mean "Business transacted over the Internet".\n\nE-Commerce consists of three components.\n\n1. A Merchant Account. The Merchant Account gives you the ability to take Credit Card information from your \nprospective customers. There are many sites on the Internet where you can apply for a Merchant Account. Typically\nyou pay from $100 - $300 to start this process. Ultimately the Merchant Account is issued through an \nAuthorizing Bank. Click here to access EasyCart Merchant Account provider partners.\n\nThink of the Merchant Account as a Drivers License. Just because you have a Drivers License doesn't mean you \ncan drive. In order to move around you need a vehicle! Likewise - in order for you to use your Merchant Account \nyou need a vehicle to move the information around. An example of how to move this information might be a \ntelephone. You could just ask your website prospects to call you on the phone. The phone is then your vehicle \nto move the Credit Card information.\n\n2. Online Shopping Cart software is another example of a vehicle to move Credit Card and ordering information. \nYour customers can efficiently order 24 hours a day. Also a Shopping Cart eliminates some potential for error \nbecause there is only one human involved in the process - rather than two. Online Shopping Cart software also \nincreases your credibility on the Internet.\n\nThe Shopping Cart is a vehicle that enables you to; Get the ordering information from the customer; Verify via \nemail to the customer that the order has been made; Deliver the notification and ordering information to the seller. \nThe more information the shopping cart can collect - the wider it's application can be.\n\n3. Transaction Device or Software is how you Deliver the money. Now that you have the customers money - \n(Credit Card information)- you need a place to deposit it. Your Bank! But you still have some choices to make. \nAre you going to walk in and place the transaction with the Teller? Are you going to drop it in the Night Deposit \nbox? Are you going to utilize the bank's Drive In option?\n\nIn the same manner you have to decide how you are going to deposit the E-Commerce transaction into \nyour bank account.\n\nHere again you have 3 basic choices.\n\nA device in your office to enter the transaction over the phone lines. This device will be similar to those you \nsee in retail stores when you buy something using a credit card. There are many options with widely \nvarying prices. \nInternet software that enables you to 'deposit' your transaction over the Internet. Typically by filling out an \nonline form. Here again you will find a rather wide variation - in most cases you will need to rent the software \non a monthly basis. \nReal Time Credit Processing. This is the service provided by companies such as AuthorizeNet. Using this \nmethod your Shopping Cart interfaces with the Real Time Credit Processing company to complete the transaction. \nThis takes place automatically while the customer is placing the order. Using this method the customer and the \nseller is notified as to whether the credit card account has sufficient funds to enable the transaction. \nThe only difference between these three is how the transaction is entered with the bank. We suggest you use the \nmethod most economical to your situation.	Business & Finance

The reasons to interview groups: to interview as many as possible, to see how you react in a group setting of your "peers", and to test your ability to excel in a group setting by voicing your opinion instead of staying quiet and passive.  First, be on time, dress appropriately (not too formal because you look fake and not too casual lest you look sloppy), be prepared for the standard interview questions (how would you contribute, what difficult situations have occurred in previous employment and how did you handle them, strengths vs. weaknesses)...it's christmas time, seasonal help is needed all over, as long as you follow these simple suggestions it is in the bag, don't worry and get some sleep to be well rested for the interview	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Do you have the money to pursue these things?  Maybe, maybe not.  The ACLU stands up and helps those who think they have been wronged who may not have the means nor smarts to do it on their own.\n\nThey look after civil rights in the constitution just as the NRA rights for 2nd amendment rights.   Both are necesary advocates for our constitutional rights..   You may not always like what either does but in general they're good org's to have in place.	Politics & Government

question_title: Mexicans want to bypass the immigrations laws.  Is this fair to other races like Chinese, French, etc? [SEP] question_content: Other races have to immigrate legally.  Why do Mexicans think they are better then everyone else?  Not all Mexicans, just the ones bitching about everything. [SEP] best_answer: ILLEGAL ALIENS in America are here only because they are GUILTY of CRIMINAL VIOLATION  of our FEDERAL LAWS, Jumping our borders and living in a shadowy underground economy. They are morally culpable for shoving aside those who adhere to the law and enter these United States in orderly and Legal Fashion. \nSince when do criminals and cheaters receive pride of place for the blessings of liberty, over those honestly, earnestly and faithfully seeking to become American citizens? \n\nPresident Bush has called for a reasonable and civil debate over the issues of border security and immigration reform. But the American people understand there can be no responsible immigration reform UNTIL OUR BORDERS ARE SECURE. ‚ÄúGuest worker‚Äù amnesty programs ARE NOT a part of border security. \nAmnesty is not the answer. To grant amnesty to these trespassers is to say "You crossed our borders ILLEGALLY, You BROKE OUR LAWS and now we are REWARDING you with U.S. Citizenship -- Congratulations!" \n\nThis is unacceptable.

question_title: does anybody realize what kind work most illegals are willing to do? [SEP] question_content: when i met my husband he was and still is cleaning floors its not easy work to strip and wax a store as big as a wal-mart in one week but he did it. when we moved on behalf of his job we tried to find a white or anybody (other than hispanic) to take the job it payed $2,800 a month do you know the ONLY person willing to take the job was a mexicon so why is every body so down on having hispanics legal they so jobs no white man wants even when it pays good money [SEP] best_answer: That's nice because your illegal husband is making more than most legals make.  You say $2800 like it's nothing.  That's a lot of money.  So if your husband becomes legal, then does that mean he will stop doing the work he is doing now?  If your arguing that illegals work hard and do jobs that U.S. citizens wont do and that this benefits the U.S., then with your logic if he got amnesty he would quit that job and then no one would do that work period, right?

question_title: Is there a common formula for a judge to sentence a convicted person to death? What exactly does he/she say? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 1.) Only certain crimes are eligible for the death penalty. The jury must first find the defendant guilty of an eligible crime (with aggrivating factors if required by the state).\n\n2.) To my knowledge, all states as well as the federal government require a jury to vote unanimously for the death penalty. This is why prospective jurors are asked if they would apply the death penalty if it was called for by law.	Politics & Government

question_title: How does a criminal record affect the immigration process to get a permanent green card? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what the crime was.  \n\nIf it was only a speeding ticket, you're okay.  First offense DUI, you should be fine.  \n\nBut if you're talking about drug trafficking, illegal immigrant trafficking, murder, etc., then forget about it.  The USCIS will deport you at the first chance.  \n\nSo, as always, it's best to consult with immigration attorneys.  The general rule (the "line") is whether that crime involves "moral turpitude."  But you may want an attorney to represent you to argue your case (or present it in the best light) in your adjustment proceedings.	Politics & Government

question_title: does anyone know the cause of napoleons defeat at waterloo? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Napoleon lost the battle for a number of reasons:\nan accident of weather. As before all of Wellington's battles, it rained heavily all the previous night so Napoleon could use neither his guns nor his cavalry to their best advantage. His guns sank up to their axles in the mud and his cavalry could not charge uphill in the soggy conditions. The start of the battle was delayed for about two hours, so that the ground could dry out a little.\nWellington's tactics were superb. He refused to move from the high ground into the boggy valley, so the French had to take the battle to him, uphill and through mud.\nWellington used the "thin red line" and hid his troops: this surprised Napoleon, who had never seen this method of fighting. Wellington had perfected them in Spain while Napoleon was occupied in fighting elsewhere.\nWellington's smaller force held the French to a stalemate from about 11 a.m. (when the battle started), until about 4 p.m. Wellington was about to give the order for a general retreat following Napoleon's order for a general advance, when Blucher arrived and tipped the balance in favour of the Allies.\nNapoleon said he lost Waterloo because of the "obstinate bravery of the English troops" - many of whom were Irish. [1]\nThere is an account that Napoleon was not functioning at his best because of a medical problem. It seems that he suffered terribly from haemorrhoids (piles); his physician used leeches to alleviate the pain but during the night of 16 June, the leeches were lost. The physician gave Napoleon laudanum to alleviate the pain but by accident administered an overdose; consequently, at Waterloo, Napoleon's abilities were imp	Politics & Government

question_title: Discovery or Discloser law? [SEP] question_content: I am not sure of the correct terminology but I know that both the prosecution and defense have a duty to disclose and share all evidence that they may have so as to give each side an opportunity to have their own experts give their opinion. does the defendant and or his or her spouse have a right to view this evidence as well?  in other words can the defendants spouse optain any and all copies of paperwork that the attorney may have regarding the case?  what is the exact statute and wording? [SEP] best_answer: It's not a statute, it's a court rule of procedure. Discovery takes in interrogatories, requests for documents and depositions. It can include a "view" when the locus of an event cannot be seen from a public way.\n\nJust because the information has been disclosed to the party's lawyer does not mean it can be shared with a spouse of the party, since the attorney must maintain attorney-client privilege even as to a spouse.\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecution generally has a duty to disclose evidence exculpating the defendant. The defendant, except in MA and a couple of other states and federal courts, there is no general duty on the defense to share information with the prosecutor.\n\nA defense lawyer will usually share any disclosures with the defendant. But the lawyer will tell the defendant not to disclose it to anyone else if it will affect the case when it gets out.	Politics & Government

There are several approved drug treatments that seem to slow the growth of the HIV viruses (which causes AIDS), and seem to slow the progress of the AIDS disease.\nSo far, these are imperfect for several reasons; they don't work for everyone, they have serious side effects, and the virus is "learning" to overcome these drugs.\nCancer is actually many different diseases, with many different causes, affecting many different parts of the body, and with many different outcomes.

[SEP] question_content: my patient was told 36 is the life expectancy of this illness she is 34 now does anyone know if this is true she was diagnosed in her early 20's also wonder if it is contagious in anyway to the care givers or family. [SEP] best_answer: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an inherited, progressive nervous system disorder causing loss of balance and coordination.\n\nThe rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symptom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility by age 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications is also quite variable.  but may be as late as the mid-sixties.  the particular length of the triple repeat has not been correlated strongly enough with disease progression to allow prediction of the course of the disease on this basis.it is not catching .\nThe gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin. Normal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structures known as mitochondria, where it is thought to be involved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, the frataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with nonsense information known as a "triple repeat." This extra DNA interferes with normal production of frataxin, thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence may be repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symptoms and severity of FA seems to be associated with the number of repetitions. Patients with more copies have more severe symptomatology. Researchers are still wrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromosome 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggests that FA develops in part because defects in iron transport prevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.\n\nThe nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the spinal cord involved in relaying information between muscles and the brain. Tight control of movement requires complex feedback between the muscles promoting a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. Without this control, movements become uncoordinated, jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.\n\nits inherted in the genes.	Health

Seeing as I haven't known much different, I can't tell what would be different if I had a less stressful life. Would I have a better memory? Would my weight be different? What are typical changes in our body from stress? [SEP] best_answer: Effects of Stress \n\n\nStress can affect you both immediately (acute stress) and over time (chronic stress).\n\nTension is often the first signal of acute stress. Tense muscles are tight and feel "hard" to the touch. A tense mind makes you feel jumpy, irritable, and unable to concentrate. This could be your signal to do something about stress, both for your immediate comfort and to prevent the long-term effects of stress.\n\nSymptoms of stress\nCommon symptoms of stress include:\n\nRapid heartbeat. \nHeadache. \nStiff neck and/or tight shoulders. \nBackache. \nRapid breathing. \nSweating and sweaty palms. \nUpset stomach, nausea, or diarrhea. \nYou also may notice signs of stress in your thinking, behavior, or mood. You may:\n\nBecome irritable and intolerant of even minor disturbances. \nFeel irritated or frustrated, lose your temper more often, and yell at others for no reason. \nFeel jumpy or exhausted all the time. \nFind it hard to concentrate or focus on tasks. \nWorry too much about insignificant things. \nDoubt your ability to do things. \nImagine negative, worrisome, or terrifying scenes. \nFeel you are missing opportunities because you cannot act quickly.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Witch-hazel is the common name for a genus of shrubs Hamamelis in the family Hamamelidaceae, with four species, two in North America (H. virginiana and H. vernalis), and one each in Japan (H. japonica) and China (H. mollis). The Persian Ironwood, a closely related tree formerly treated as Hamamelis persica, is now given a genus of its own, as Parrotia persica, as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are Parrotiopsis, Fothergilla and Sycopsis (see under Hamamelidaceae). The Witch-Hazel is not closely related to the Common Hazel.\n\nThey are popular garden shrubs, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers which begin to expand in the autumn before the leaves fall and continue throughout the winter.

question_title: How do you increase your Will Power? [SEP] question_content: There are a great many things that we know to be true and we know the steps how to achieve them.  Yet, many of us do not.\nFor example, we know that eating more fruits and vegetables will give you longer life.  Yet many of us do not.\nWe know that 8-10 glasses of water each day will assist in a great many body functions.  Yet, many of us hardly drink ANY water.\n\nTherefore, I assume it is Will Power which will allow us to follow the directions to a "T" and avoid harmful things.  How do YOU increase YOUR Will Power? [SEP] best_answer: Following things to a T wont work. You have to let yourself some leeway for messing up, otherwise the first time you actually do mess up you wont want to continue what you are doing because it isn't perfect. \nDont shoot for perfection. Aim for progress. Do a little bit at a time. Instead of drinking 8-10 glasses of water, aim for drinking some during the day.\nThe way I increase my will power to do something: Visualizing the end result and not wanting to feel like crapola anymore!!

[SEP] best_answer: No. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. You can only get it through sexual contact with another person. Touching yourself is a solo act, so there's no danger of syphilis. Your skin is likely irritated from the dried semen sitting on it overnight. Take extra time to clean up and you should be fine. Also, make sure you are using a lubricant, as this could be a chafing issue as well.	Health

question_title: Women, do you hate when you man.........................? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering if any other women out there have this problem? I have caught my husband on several occasions "releasing" himself. He knows that if he wants some, all he has to do is just come to me. What makes me really upset, is that when we have a night to ourselves, he'd rather do "that'' than make love to his wife(me). I have told him that this hurts my feelings, and that it makes me feel unattractive on several occasions. But again, it continues. Am I the only one? [SEP] best_answer: I've caught my husband doing it frequently also. We had a talk about it though and he told me sometimes he just doesnt feel like sex because he needs release and just wants to get it over with. I actually woke up one night and he was releasing himself while watching a porno on mute. I freaked out about it. I love pleasing him and it offends me too. Although I can kind of relate to why he does it without me sometimes because I do it without him sometimes too. I just dont want to have sex sometimes. it seems though that he doesnt want to have sex with you at all...and if that is what your saying, let him catch you a few times...if it doesnt make him jump your bones right then...I guess the only thing to do is look into couples therapy. Some guys are actually addicted to masterbating.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Women Only!!!!! Need Advice and Tips!!!!? [SEP] question_content: I was talkin to this girl for a year and she decided right before new years to break it up cuz she felt it was gettin boring and she didnt know whut she wanted. The time we were talkin, she would say how much she loved me, and she wanted kids with me, etc. We kept mild contact like a couple phone calls a week, but 3 weeks later, I find out she talkin to another guy. I write a letter to her, but it doesn't seem to affect her cuz she tells me "why am i trying so hard", and "things are different now". I still love her a lot, and I know she still cares some what because her friend likes me more than the new guy and tells me that she thinks of me sometimes. It's been 3 mos. and the situation hasn't changed, but I dont know if I'm doin something wrong. We haven't talked for like 3 weeks. How can I bring the attraction back? the guy shes talkin to is a loser (but i dont show it bothers me)!! doesn't work or go to school!! PLEASE...any advice on how to get her back would help a lot!! [SEP] best_answer: You want her back bro. This is man to man sh*t here. Blow her off. Seriously, just trust my advice and blow her off. Pretend you are on and better off and she will see that and realize you are intriguing to her again and she will start talking to you again. But play semi hard to get with her. Take it like you don't give a damn about nothing and if you 2 ever get together again it doesn't make a differance to you. But try to be exciting around her. Do something you normally wouldn't do. Take a chance and make sure she sees it or knows about it. You can handle it. Woman are complex creatures but once you know how to get through to them, you are golden for life. Well until they catch on to your knowledge of their ways.	Family & Relationships

We want completely the wrong thing. One day I was on there and this cute dude IM me and of course we started conversation and we realize in that 30 minutes that we want the same things in life. The basics love, marriage, and children minus the drama, lies, and challenge. We both been through relationships that we love despite of the other person. Well my dilema is that he's in Ghana at the present time. He sent me this sweet email and I responded and I sent one back and the next day which was yesterdayI had more thoughts so I sent another. He has checked both of them and he hasn't responded. Should I just wait or just put as it could of, would of but isn't. [SEP] best_answer: Give him time. Do you know his work schedule and what it is like. He may have checked the email and just not had time to respond to it. Maybe he is gathering his thoughts of what he may want to say to you. Sometimes it is harder for men to express their feelings because they don't want to seem like a pushover, or move to fast. I would wait and give him another day or so. I know that it can be hard when you are filled with anticipation. In the end, follow your heart for you are the only one who knows what makes you truly happy.......Best of luck to you	Family & Relationships

question_title: if i'm 23 and my bf is 34 is he to old for me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is simply not enough information to answer in a helpful way. 11 years is not too much in all cases, depending on things like maturity, wanting the same things, sharing things in common, etc. The age alone is not a problem, but the greater the age difference is, typically it is harder to make things work over the long haul. That shouldn't discourage you though; even people who are 20 or more years different make it work!	Family & Relationships
question_title: How one can measure  whether one is broad minded or consevative in all aspects ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Broadminded and conservative are mutually exclusive terms.  Conservatives have a set of beliefs that narrow their outlook, and their minds are by nature geared to have a narrow outlook and to want a narrow outlook.  They thrive having their minds restricted by authoritarian ideologies like religion, law-and-order, and other such prescribing dictates.  They are very uncomfortable with personal liberty management, and that is why they fight so constantly to get enforcement of prescribing rules and regulations.  It looks like they want everyone to go by what they believe, and that sure would be fine with them, but what really motivates them is their own need to escape the frightening personal liberty management issues that broadminded people handle well and enjoy.\n\nSo you can tell if you are broadminded or conservative by how well you deal with personal liberty, how threatened you are by non-standard and traditional life-styles, how much liberty you are willing to tolerate other people having.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Please HELP!!!? [SEP] question_content: Help me my ex- boyfriend is stalking me and he wont stop I already have a restraining order on him he still wont stop he even threatins to hit me [SEP] best_answer: Try to get pics of him violating the restraining order.  ALSO get a tape recorder and tape it anytime he threatens you.  Verbal threats are a violation of yet another law. As soon as you have these things take them to the police station and tell them everything and show them your proof.  Be very careful, sometimes these types of people will escalate the bad behavior instead of giving up and going away.	Family & Relationships
question_title: when to stop making love with your pregnant wife? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The first three months are the most critical and some doctors do not recommend intercourse during that time but afterwards it is ok, it is even recommended towards the end to induce labor! So, I would say go ahead unless she becomes uncomfortable about it and it's important to choose positions where you are not pressing on her stomach.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: give it a week first, and see what happens. If he doesn't call you, call him and let him have a great time talking to you (leave him wanting more) you can even drop a hint - "call me only if you want to" then laugh.\nIf he doesnt call you after this, don't ever ever ever call him again.

The thing to do when you and your wife fight is to kiss and make up  - that's the fun thing to do.  a family fight shouldn't cause hatred of all women - even angels - You are too emotional over it. Like I said, kiss and make up - soon.	Family & Relationships

No one ever buys those things there because there aren't many of us.  Another place to look is consignment shops.  Once again, great deals because no one wants those things.  There useless to most people.  After a while you will look at every LH club you see and think you have to have it.	Sports

question_title: What makes Barca so different from other clubs......? [SEP] question_content: ....... Mes que un club or More than a club, has a really new meaning now when they have a contract with UNICEF........ what do you think about this two new promotional films with UNICEF..... are they doing this just to make more money with selling products, broadcasting ,... or they really want to help all those kids that REALLY need help!!!\n\nhttp://www.fcbarcelona.com/unicef/en/ [SEP] best_answer: those vids are great, tnx for the link. i like it that they're not OA or too self-promotional.\n\nanyway, to your Q. linking up with unicef certainly creates a lot of goodwill for barca, and that‚Äôs obviously good for business.  i think the tie-up is really a master stroke bec. aside from the prestige of unicef,  football which barca is bringing into the partnership is the world game, watched by everyone young and old, rich and poor, and kids all over love it, so it‚Äôs good economics to ride on that and that‚Äôs probably why this idea was conceived in the 1st place.  but then again children‚Äôs causes are really easy to fall into, we all have a soft spot for these things, so maybe the genuine desire to help is really THERE.  bottomline is, whatever barca‚Äôs motivations are, unicef will  stand to benefit a whole lot from these arrangements and that to me is the most impt. thing: financially, there‚Äôs that cash pledge of 1.5 mil euro which is a big help, and promotionally, too, in terms of the linkage itself, unicef gets a leg up --- barca is a hugely popular team and ronaldinho with his inspiring success story and wholesome image sets a good example for evry1, so all these can only help unicef  attract more institutional support for its initiatives in promoting children‚Äôs welfare. it‚Äôs a win-win situation for both parties in terms of exposure but I‚Äôd also like to think that  barca is a club that really wants to  make a difference....

question_title: How to write an argumentative essay? [SEP] question_content: i need to have emotion,effect, and logically. [SEP] best_answer: First of all you need to pick a good topic, one that can be won.   Make sure it is a topic on which it is easy to take a clear stand.   Good ones are usually those on which people have very definite opinions.  Gun control, abortion, capital punishment, right to die, etc. are good topics for argumentative essays - they have emotion built in.\n\nIn your essay you have to do more than state your opinion - you have to support your argument with facts and evidence and research and statistics.  You need to be able to give examples to back up your stand.  An argumentative essay is rather like a debate - you want to persuade others to agree with you.\n\nThese sites should help you.

[SEP] question_content: a) Show that the line x + y = q will intersect the curve x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 in two distinct points if q¬≤ is more than 2q + 5.\n\nb) if the line y + 2x = p does not intersect the curve y¬≤ = x + p, find the range of values of p. \n(answer to this question is p is less than -1/24 but i can't figure the solution!) [SEP] best_answer: a) Let x+y = q -----eqn1\n       x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 -----eqn2\n\nsub x= q-y into eqn2:\n(q-y)^2 -2(q-y) + 2y^2 =3\n\nq^2 -2qy +y^2 -2q +2y +2y^2 =3\n\ncomparing the coefficients of the eqn with that of a standard quadratic eqn, ax^2 +bx +c, we have\na= 3\nb= -2q+2\nc= q^2 -2q -3\n\nAnd to check for the nature of the roots of this eqn, we need to find the determinant, b^2 -4ac.\n\n(-2q +2)^2 -4(3)(q^2 -2q -3)\n\nsolving this and you will eventually get \nq^2 -2q -5\n\nHowever, given that q^2 > 2q +5, we know that q^2 -2q -5 > 0.\n\nSince the determinant is greater than 0, it shows that there are 2 real and distinct roots of the eqn given.\n\nb) the approach is the same, but you must know that since the two curves dont intersect, we would need to find or show b^2 -4ac < 0, ie the determinant is negative.

question_title: What are BAR codes,ISBN codes,MASS code? How are they read? Are there any other code used by other agencies? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bar codes, UPC codes,  ISBNs and other such codes are like social security numbers, to distinguish different products.  No two people have the same SS number, so no two products have the same bar code. \n\nThe bars in the barcode correspond to a number- a laser run across it can read the bars and translate them into numbers. The only reason people use barcodes is because they can be read just by waving the laser in front- it's easier. Usually, you can get the same information if you know  the numbers the barcode represents, and type in the numbers.\n\nThe numbers encoded are the price the store is charging, and also lets stores keep track of how many of each product they sell. \n\nLibraries often use bar codes to keep track of which patrons have borrowed which book.\n\nThe ISBN is, in fact, not a barcode, but it is a specific number that represents that particular book all over the world. Only books that are exactly alike, (even if they are the same title. like a paperback and hardback version of the same book) have the same ISBN.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there anyway to back out of a grant given to you by a college? [SEP] question_content: My college offered me a 1000$ grant.  I accepted but no longer wish to go to that college.  My friends said I can't back out of grants...I'm sure you can..what if there is an emergency?  Anyone know what I can do? [SEP] best_answer: Of course you can! These things are almost always non-binding. In fact, most schools will cancel your financial aid automatically when they find out you're not attending.  \n\nIf the grant is a federal grant, the process will be taken care of for you, since one of the fundamental rules of financial aid administration is that you can't disburse funding for a student who isn't attending your school.  As I said, if you told your school that you aren't coming, chances are that they already cancelled your grant.\n\nIf the grant is from the school itself, chances are that the regulations are similar.  No school wants to throw their money away on a student who doesn't go to their school, so they will check and double-check to make sure that you are a student there before they disburse your grant funds.  If you are uncertain, just give them a call to confirm this.	Education & Reference
