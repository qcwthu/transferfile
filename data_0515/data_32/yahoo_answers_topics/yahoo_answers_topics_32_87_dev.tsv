question_title: Whats the name of the horror film about big foot terrorising a familly in texas,? [SEP] question_content: It was shown on t.v. in the late 70s or early 80s. and used to scare me witless. I think it was about a big foot, at least it was a monster simmilar to a bigfoot. I belive that the film was adapted from a true story. Again I think it was set in texas, but I remember there being swamps in the film. It killed the familly dog and chickens. and try'd to get in to the home. I remember the end of the film, where a man -could of been a police man- standing by his car on a road and looking in to the forest/swamp he was wearing a stetson and sunglasses, there was a voice over talking about the horror that tookplace in the forrest.\ncan you help me with this? as for some reason it has been in my mind for the past few months.

question_title: Did anyone watch Nip/Tuck last night? [SEP] question_content: Who was the psychiatrist that Connor was talking to? At first I thought it was Matt because it sounded like him, but then I realized it wasn't. [SEP] best_answer: A figment of Shawn's imagination. Shawn was dreaming about what could go wrong with his relationships with his family. You can tell it is him in the way he turns out rich and successful. His ego came shining through the dream. These wher his worst dreams. Afterall, he pushed for the first hand surgery on Connor. He is afraid that Connor will blame himself for his marriage breaking up the way he blames himself for his father leaving him  and his mother when he was a child. The analyst may be Shawn or may be an analyst Shawn has seen to deal with his problems in the past. My guess is it will cause him to go see Christian's analyst Brooke.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: have you all seen the previews? [SEP] question_content: of  the new Superman movie. Do you think its going to be good? [SEP] best_answer: Yes and yes.  The movie is directed by Bryan Springer who did the first two X-Men movies.  He did not direct the latest and third X-Men film because he was busy with Superman.  Two of his screenwriters from the first two X-Men films wrote the script for the new Superman.  I think that is why X-Men 3 is not as good the first 2 films, because the behind-the-scenes talent left to work on Superman.  So that means that Superman Returns should be one really, really good movie.  I also just learned that there MIGHT be a teaser trailer for next summer's Spider-Man 3 movie played before Superman Returns; if this is true, then going to see Superman will be a great experience for a lot of people.

question_title: whats the best way to shave my pubic area? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Snip a few first!Cut the hair down with scissors or clippers to about a quarter of an inch. If this is the first time you've shaved, or the first time in a long while and you are dealing with full growth again, you can do this a few days before you actually start shaving to get used to it. If you've never shaved your pubic hair before, then your skin has been covered by that hair for a very long time. The sensation of clothes and so on rubbing against it is going to be weird at first. \n\nThe first time you shave your pubic area, you may want to shave only a bit, then come back and do more later. This is sensitive skin we're dealing with here. Also, don't shave very often at first. Once a week for the first month is probably best, so your skin can get used to it. \n\nDon't worry about getting an extremely close shave the first few times; you'll get a closer one as you become more adept. \n\nIf you're female, your pubic area may become more sensitive during your period. \n\nSome people like to leave a patch of pubic hair above their penis or over the mons veneris. It may sound ridiculous, but an electric beard and moustache trimmer is perfect for keeping the patch neat. It's an extremely easy way to keep that patch short, even, and neat. In fact, if you want to keep all your pubic hair trimmed but not shaven, the trimmer can be used on the entire area. \n\nWhile shaving, sit (or lie if someone else is doing the shaving) with your legs far apart. This helps keep the skin taut and lessens the chance of the blade snagging a fold of skin. \n\nIf you have teeny little nicks or blood spots, there are a couple reasons why this might be happening. The most common reason is you're going to fast. Either you're shaving too quickly, or you're not allowing enough prep time. Remember: \nSoak the area for at least three minutes in warm water. If you're not going to take a shower or bath, lay a warm wet washcloth over the area for a while first. \nApply shaving gel and let it sit for at least four minutes. \nTake your time shaving. \nLittle blood spots are often the result of shaving over tiny bumps that are naturally there. Soaking and leaving the gel on helps make these bumps softer and smaller so that they're less likely to get nicked. The bumps also may be a result of irritation from a past shave. If this is the case, stop and wait a while before the next shave. \n\nWhen you first start shaving, or if irritation or itchiness is a problem, wear loose underwear and clothing. \n\nAlways remember to keep clean. Your genital hair helped protect from dirt, bacteria, friction and so on, so it's important to take care of yourself. Use soap and water on your outside bits -- your inside parts will keep themselves clean naturally.	Health
question_title: trichmoniasis treatment for a male is what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is trichomoniasis treated? \nTrichomoniasis can usually be cured with the prescription drug, metronidazole (also called Flagyl), or with a related drug, tinidazole. Topical medicines, or medicines applied to the skin, may be used in people who are allergic to metronidazole and tinidazole. The topical medicines are less effective and may not cure you. They might, however, ease the symptoms. \n\nAll women and men diagnosed with trichomoniasis should be treated. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. Having trichomoniasis also increases a person’s chances of getting HIV. People being treated for trichomoniasis should avoid sex until they and their sex partners complete treatment and have no symptoms. Having trichomoniasis once does not protect a person from getting it again.\n\nBetter if consult and have examination by physician. these drugs are not over the counter.	Health
question_title: Adult ADD + Questions? [SEP] question_content: I was wondering if Adult Attention Deficit Disorder is common these days. I have been on and through so many antidepressants and mood stabilers in the past 6 years it's unreal. And if that's not enough, Bi-Polar meds, sleep meds, almost xanax. Nothing has ever come close to me feeling liike one of you regular souls who have the drive to do what you do. I am only 18, and do not have a doctorates degree yet, but I can tel you one thing; all the SSRI's and MAOI's and MOI's and SSNRI's and SNRI's are NOT going to work on me. I believe I have ADD - but only because i took a test on the internet and identified all of my symptoms in a clear voice. What should I say to my doctor? It's only a pediatrition but he gave me paxil once, and that ended me up in the hospital\ni will never ever do that again.\nWhat do you think the chances of him giving me adderol? or any other popular ADD drug without going through another one of those stinking evaluations that takes months to even see a psychiatrist? [SEP] best_answer: Howdy ADD; By your writing I can empathize with your frustration; however, frustration may be a result of an emotional allergic reflex by your understanding and sensing of your inner self which may be harmful to your future emotional welfare.\nAntidepressants do work on many people especially those that suffer anxiety disorders.\nMood Stabilizers (Paxil, Prozac,etc.) also tend to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with ADD.\nI can feel for you if you had an adverse reaction this far into your treatment with psychothropic medicants.\nAt this time and in my limited psyche can only offer a comforting suggestion and that is that you may be a 'hyper-allergic' person.\nHave you had any physical allergy tests to date?\nIt is my opinion that an allergic reaction in the atmosphere may irritate the mind into a distracted state that will make short-term mamory stagnant in neural flow and therefore long-term memory retention impossible.\nRetake your psychological tests again and ask the Psychologist to place the results of both tests side by side for your personal assessment.\nIt is normal to forget the answers that you have provided in the previous test, but it you reapproach this process with a hopeful attitude I am sure that you will be that much closer to your emotional betterment. Good Fortune to you, Jose	Health
question_title: plain water or fruit juice ? [SEP] question_content: which is better after a workout ? [SEP] best_answer: 1.  Drink liquid early. Take in 16 oz. of fluid 2 hours before you exercise.\n \n2.  Drink liquid often. Take in about 5 to 8 oz. every 15 to 20 minutes; this gives your body a chance to absorb a constant flow of liquid.\n \n3.  Add sports mixes containing carbohydrates and electrolytes to your liquids, especially when exercising for more than 1 hour.\n \n4.  Keep the liquids within the 60 to 70 degree range for easier absorption.\n \n5.  Keep drinks accessible when exercising. Store all fluids in easy-to-use containers that can be opened without disrupting your exercise.\n \n6.  Drink after working out to compensate for the fluid your body loses during exercise.\n\nplain water is better because it replenishes the water you lost during the workout.	Health
question_title: How do I help an Alcoholic that doesn't think he has a problem and his family that doesnt want to addess it. [SEP] question_content: The guy has a bad problem with booze, however the family is too blind to see that he has a problem.  He doesnt think he has a problem, and will not go to AA.  His wife considers herself a smart person but instead keeps buying beer for him so he will not be mad.  What to do? [SEP] best_answer: As a 3 year member of Alcoholics Anonymous I'm gonna try to answer this.  Unfortunately as someone else responded to your question I agree that most likely and sadly you can't do much to help him if he doesn't want help.  As we say in AA, AA is not for those who need it but for those who want it.  As for his family you might try honestly, humbly, and lovingly letting his family know how concerned you are and that you don't know what to do.  I don't know if you have any spiritual beliefs but you might try praying for the man, I will.  James S. -Alcoholic Anonymous	Health

question_title: how do i get my girlfriend an orgasm, without her faking, a real trick that works please!? [SEP] question_content: whether its oral or regualr intercourse someone let me know [SEP] best_answer: First, get her very, very turned on. Whether orally or otherwise, the more she is excited and the higher her peak of excitement before intercourse, the greater likelihood she will have an orgasm. So don't skimp on foreplay. Being in a hurry here will get you nowhere in the end.\n\nAssuming you've done the above and you both want to assure that she has an excellent orgasm, teach her this little trick (I just hope you're old enough and mature enough to be learning all this). Regardless of the position you use, tell her that you want to touch herself, masturbate, while you are in her. Most women don't get stimulated where they need to be from most forms of male intercourse. The clitoris has to be given friction in some way for orgasm. If she manipulates herself and you do what you can, she will likely have the best orgasm she's every known.\n\nUnfortunately many men don't like to think that they can't make a woman orgasm just by themselves. Sometimes they can, but the way I describe above is almost guaranteed. Some women are too modest or are not used to self-manipulation, and they need to be assured that you want them to do this and will not think less of them for it.\n\nEnjoy. Please practice safe sex.

question_title: What is the prevalence of experiencing a miscarriage with NO SYMPTOMS? (no bleeding, cramping)? [SEP] question_content: I am 29 and I had one miscarriage 10 years ago as a teen.  I've been obsessing and worrying about miscarrying now.  Today, I am 9 weeks pregnant.  I have no symptoms (no morning sickness, no food aversions or cravings, no sensitivity to smell).  We heard a heartbeat at 5 weeks and 6 days, but I keep reading these stories of women who miscarry at about 8 to 10 weeks without even realizing it until their sonogram.  I have been tired lately and my breasts were very tender 2 weeks ago, but they feel fine now.  Thank you for your help. [SEP] best_answer: First calm down. I understand why you are concerned. Losing a baby is very tragic. But just because it happened 10 years ago doesn't mean it is going to happen now. The symptoms you have described for yourself are normal. I didn't have sickness, cravings, sensitivity to smell with my pregnancy either. Count this as a blessing! Being tired and on/off breast tenderness is normal. Try reading "What to expect when expecting" "Girlfriends guide to pregnancy" etc... Stop obsessing about losing this baby and start enjoying him/her. I truly understand the concerns. Make an appt. with your doctor to help ease your mind. As far as having a miscarriage WITH OUT ANY symptoms I don't know about. That is a question for the professionals.	Health

question_title: For deaf people? [SEP] question_content: I am currectly half deaf (completely deaf out of my right ear). it's not that bad, but i would like my other ear back, as it was. I recently heard of an operation that installs an artifical ear drum (requires the nerve ending in the ear to be still intact). but this system requries a wire coming out behind the ear and to a power source on your belt. so here's my question. dooes anyone know of any alternitive? do you know someone who has it? how is it working for them? thanks [SEP] best_answer: Well, I am in the same boat as you.  I am also completely deaf in my right ear.  I have been like this since I was about 2 years old.  I do use a digital hearing aid. I was fortunate to have one of the best doctors in this area before he retired last year.  Years ago, I told they were doing research on the birds because the little hair behind their ear drum or the nerve endings themselves could regenerate.  I am not sure as to what their progress was because it has been so long.  As far as alternatives, implants aren't the best if you still have partial hearing because you will be hearing two different sound types.  One would be true sound that you hear out the good ear and the other would be a synthesized sound like you would hear a robot talking.  So it would be just best to wait until they come out with something better than Coclier(misspelled) implants.  If you need anything else let me know.	Health

question_title: It is so easy not to start smoking or drinking, so why do so many people do it? [SEP] question_content: I personally believe that it is too easy NOT to begin smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol (and not to mention abusing drugs).  Sure, there is peer pressure and people become stressed.  But each individual is fully capable of managing stress without resorting to such unhealthy habits.   We were made to be able to cope naturally.  Smoking and drinking are simply too dangerous for excuses.  I'm stressed out all the time; in fact, I get stressed out at the drop of a hat.  But I have no desire or need to do these things, even if they are readily available.  They are obviously extremely addictive and put users at much higher risk for cancer and other diseases.  And how many people kill themselves and others while driving drunk?  I would also like to know why exactly 18 year-olds (and younger) consider themselves old enough to drink.  They're not, I'm not.  It's illegal, simple as that.  We underestimate the dangers of these habits.  My main point is:  it's just too easy to avoid them. [SEP] best_answer: It's easy to start, hard to stop, and some people think its cool so they do it to try and impress them to be cool too. So, its generally peer pressure that starts it and then that person finds out the benefits and ignores the long term damages, and keeps doing alcohol or drugs or whichever, until they are so addicted its almost impossible to stop before they die. Thats why when they go through a serious condition (heart attack) and are hospitilized, then told they have to stop its much more likely that they will rather than stopping on their own.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Post-micturition convulsion syndrome, which often affects men, occurs toward the end of the urination session and isn't completely understood. Most speculation rather than scientific conclusions have been made regarding the cause(s). It is predominately believed that the shiver is a side effect of interactions between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN). The SNS, in this case is responsible for holding the flow of urine, and the PNS is responsible for releasing urine. Although they are far more common amongst men, women also experience these convulsions	Health

question_title: On average, how long does it take after acl reconstruction surgery to be able to bend your knee all the way? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The previous answer is not correct. Depending on the type of graft that you choose, you may never fully gain your ROM (range of motion) back. Most doctors will tell you that if you can gain 120 degrees or better, then be happy with that. I was fortunate enough to gain 135. My normal ROM on my other knee was 137. It took me 3 months to gain this back. There are two obstacles that hold you back from bending your knee as far as you want. The first one is the PAIN!!! You body will tell you when it is ready to try a little further. While I was in surgery, my doctor bent my knee all the way back just to make sure that the graft would hold. You don't want him or her to do this while you are awake trust me. The second obstacle that doesn't allow you to bend your knee all the way back is the swelling. Your knee will have swellign in it from anywhere to 6 months up to a couple of years. The swelling limits the range of motion more than the pain itself. When you get the 70 or 80 degree range, you will notice a "tight" feeling in your knee. That is the swelling. \n   Overall, it depends on how much you do your excercises. The best excercise (also the most painful) is the heel-slide. thats where you lay on your back and attempt to bend your knee with your heel staying in constant contact with the floor or mat. Like I said, it hurts worse than any other excercise but it is the most productive.\n\n Good luck.	Health

question_title: if a dice is thrown ten times in how many ways is it possible to have 1,2,3 in the outcome? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Assuming that the 1, 2 and 3 are supposed to be consecutive:\n\nFirstly, for three throws of the die, the probability of throwing 1, 2 and 3 in order is (1/6)^3 = 1/216\n\nIf you throw the die 10 times then there are 8 independent chances of throwing 1, 2, 3. That's because if you have not thrown 1, 2, 3 by the time you get to the 9th throw, you cannot do it because you only have two throws left. \n\nTherefore the chance of throwing 1, 2, 3 with 10 throws of a die are (10 - 2) * (1/216) = 8/216 which is equivalent to 1/27.\n\nIf you prefer to express that as a decimal (not recommended!) then the answer is 0.0370 to 3 s f	Education & Reference

question_title: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x- [SEP] question_content: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x-axis [1,2] [SEP] best_answer: Let's break the area into many vertical rectangular strips between x=1 and x=2, each strip so narrow that we can assume that the top of the strip is horizontal. Thus each strip will be a very narrow and tall rectangle.\n\nLet's say the number of vertical strips we use is n. The first strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1, the next will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 1/n, the third will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 2/n, and in general the kth strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + (k-1)/n.\n\nNow, what is the y value at each of these x points? Using f(x)=x² we get, for the kth point,\n\ny = (1 + (k-1)/n)² = 1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)² \n\nNow the area of each strip is equal to its base times its height. The base of each strip is 1/n. So the area of the kth strip is\n\nA = 1/n * (1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)²)\n\nNow we have to add the areas of all these strips from k = 1 to k = n and rearrange the terms.\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + 2(k-1)/n² + (k-1)²/n^3)\n.....k=1   \n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + (2k - 2)/n² + (k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nGiving all fractions the common denominator of n^3,\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² + 2kn - 2n + k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² - 2n + 1)/n^3  + (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nThe first term in the summation sign appears n times in the sum, so we can take it out by multiplying it by n. \n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3\n\nNow let's clear the parentheses in the summation:\n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ 2k/n² + Σ k²/n^3 - Σ 2k/n^3)\n\nThe first summation contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series:\n\nS = n(n+1)/2\n\nso the first summation becomes\n\nn(n+1)/n² = (n² + n)/n² = 1 + 1/n\n\nThe last summation also contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the same formula for the sum of a series, and we get\n\nn(n+1)/n^3 = (n² + n)/n^3 = 1/n + 1/n²\n\nFor the middle summation, we have to compute the sum of k² for k=1, 2, 3, ... n, or that is the sum of 1, 4, 9, 16, ... n².\n\nThe site\n\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSum.html\n\ngives the formula for the sum of the squares of a series as\n\nS = (2n^3 + 3n² + n)/6\n\nso the middle summation becomes\n\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n²\n\nNow, we are almost done.\n\nLet's let the number of strips get very large, go to infinity as a limit. Let's see what each term becomes:\n\n(n² - 2n + 1)/n² becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1 + 1/n becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1/n + 1/n² becomes 0 as n gets very large, and\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n² becomes 1/3 as n gets very large.\n\nThe area under the curve is 1 + 1 + 1/3, or 7/3.\n\nYou can see why integral calculus was invented. Using integral calculus, this problem can be solved in two steps. The integral of f(x)=x² is x^3/3. Inserting the limits of x=1 and x=2 gives\n\nA = 2^3/3 - 1^3/3 = 7/3	Education & Reference

question_title: history of tal frauenberg castle? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Perhaps this helps...\n\nIn the Altmuehl Valley  there are many castles, and quite a number of them exceed Prunn as to extent, value of equipment or age. Nevertheless, the comparatively small castle of Prunn is one of the best-known castles of Bavaria owing to its unique site and the harmonious combination of natural scenery and architectural performance.\nA document of A.D. 1037 mentions the name of the owner of the castle: Wernher of Prunn. One hundred years later the castle belonged to the family of the barons of Laaber and Breitenbrunn . At that time the oldest preserved parts of the castle were built, above all the mighty tower.\nIn 1338 the knights of Frauenberg bought the castle, and this family retained ownership until 1567. Their heraldic figure is the white horse which was painted on the outer wall of the castle. The most famous member of the family was Jack the Joyous, an experienced warrior whose marble gravestone is in the parish church of Prunn. An heirloom of his was an ornamented manuscript of the Nibelungenlied, the famous medieval German epic. It has been called the "Prunn Godex" and is now a unique specimen in the National Library of Bavaria.\nIn the 16th century the ducal councillor von Koekh remodelled parts of the castle. Two centuries later the Jesuits added rococo ornament to a number of rooms and to the chapel. Since 1822 the castle has been state property.\n\n-or-\n\nFrombork (German: Frauenburg (pronunciation (help·info))) is a town in northern Poland, on the Vistula Lagoon in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodship, in Braniewo County, with a population of 2,528 in 2005.\n\nThe former residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, the town and its 700-year old cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war Frombork was meticulously reconstructed and is a popular tourist attraction again.\n\nThe town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prussian site. In 1224 at Catania Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia as directly subordinate to the church and the empire only and later in 1224 the pope assigned bishop William of Modena as papal legate to Prussia. According to local legend, its inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meißen, a priest of the Teutonic Order and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena after the area was conquered by Teutonic Knights, who had received possession of Prussia by the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini.\n\nSupposedly when the stronghold's lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named Frauenburg ("woman's or women's castle" in German). This name is not unique in German, but it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Marienburg, like the nearby castle and city (now Malbork).	Education & Reference

Hitler killed 11 million people, including 6 million Jews.  \n\nStalin was by far worse:\n\nJoseph Stalin (1879 - 1953)\n\nOne of the most powerful and murderous dictators in human history, Stalin was the supreme ruler of the Soviet Union for a quarter of a century. His regime of terror caused the death and suffering of tens of millions of his subjects, but he was also in charge of the war machine that played a significant role in the defeat of Hitler's armies during World War II.\n\nA Georgian by birth, Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili grew up in modest circumstances and only learned Russian at school. He studied at a theological seminary but never graduated, instead embarking on a life as a professional revolutionary. This included robbing banks to fill the Bolshevik party chest and spending years in Siberian exile.\n\nStalin was not one of the decisive players in the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, but he soon rose in the ranks. In 1922 he was made General Secretary of the Communist Party, a post which was not considered particularly significant at the time but nevertheless became the base from which he launched his bid for supreme power.\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin promoted himself as his political heir and gradually outmanoeuvred rivals. Unlike Trotsky, Stalin believed that socialism could be introduced in one country without being accompanied by a world revolution. By the late 1920s, Stalin was effectively the dictator of the Soviet Union.\n\nHis forced collectivisation of agriculture cost million of lives, while his industrialisation programme made his country militarily strong but provided little material welfare for its citizens. Moreover, the population suffered immensely during the Great Terror of the 1930s, during which Stalin and his henchmen purged the Party of 'enemies of the people' and sent millions to the Gulag system of slave labour camps.\n\nThe purges severely depleted the Red Army officer corps, and despite many warnings, Stalin was ill prepared for Hitler's massive attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941. His political future hung in the balance, but he recovered to lead his country to victory. As usual with Stalin, the human cost was enormous, but that mattered little to him. His general disregard for human lives included his own family - his eldest son perished in German captivity, his second wife committed suicide, and many in-laws were caught up in the terror.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Union entered the nuclear age and ruled over an empire which included most of Eastern Europe. Increasingly paranoid, Stalin himself became a victim of the fear he had induced in his subjects. Having suffered a stroke at night, he lay helpless on his floor for many hours, because no one dared disturb him. He died on 5 March 1953.\n\nA large part of the Soviet population reacted to his death with hysterical grief, but soon his former comrades-in-arms denounced his policies of terror and persecution. Today, Stalinism is a symbol of totalitarian rule and limitless personal power. His birth home in Gori forms part of the Stalin Museum, a bizarre and somewhat eerie Soviet monument to one of history's most bloodthirsty tyrants.	Education & Reference

question_title: Can someone help me answer the following questions? [SEP] question_content: Summarize the six components of The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975.  Can anyone help me identify the six componets I can't seem to find them anywhere. [SEP] best_answer: The following six main principles of IDEA embody the underlying spirit and intent of IDEA and provide the framework around which special education services are designed and provided to students with disabilities:\n\nFree Appropriate Public Education — IDEA guarantees that each child with a disability, eligible for special education, will be entitled to a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n\nFree requires that the education of each child with a disability must be provided at public expense and at no cost to the child’s parents. The only exception is that incidental fees normally charged to non-disabled students or their parents as part of the regular education program may also be charged to students with disabilities and their parents.\n\nAppropriate means that each child with a disability is entitled to an education that is “appropriate” for his or her needs. “Appropriate education” is determined on an individual basis and may not be the same for each child with a disability.\n\nPublic refers to the public school system. Children with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of their disabilities, have the same right to attend the public schools as their non-disabled peers. The public school system must educate students with disabilities, respond to their individual needs, and help them plan for their future.\n\nEducation - IDEA is an education act that guarantees that eligible children with disabilities will receive a public education that includes special education and related services as directed by the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP), based on the child's individual needs. \n\nAppropriate Evaluation — IDEA requires that each child suspected of having a disability receive an appropriate evaluation: \nIn all areas of suspected disability. \nBy a team of evaluators knowledgeable and trained in the use of the tests and other evaluation materials they use. \nEmploying a variety of sound evaluation materials and procedures selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. \nWithout subjecting a child to unnecessary tests and assessments. \nIncluding the gathering of relevant information from a variety of sources. \nBased on information that is useful instructionally in planning for the child’s education. \nAn appropriate evaluation provides information to be used to determine the child’s eligibility for special education and related services and the educational needs of the child. \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) — In order to ensure that students with disabilities receive an appropriate and individualized education, IDEA requires that, after drawing upon current evaluation information, the IEP team develop a written document, the IEP, designed to meet the unique educational needs of each student with disabilities. IDEA contains clear language about: \nThe information which the IEP must contain. \nWho develops the IEP. \nThe public agency’s obligation to provide the special education and related services identified in the IEP. \nLeast Restrictive Environment (LRE) — IDEA guarantees that a child with a disability will receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment (LRE) appropriate. This principle reflects IDEA’s strong preference for educating students with disabilities in general education classes with the access to general education curriculum. Placement in the general education classroom is the first placement option the IEP team must consider.\n\nWhen considering placement in the general education classroom, the team is required to explore the range of modifications and supplementary aids and services that are needed to ensure that the student can receive a satisfactory education in the general education classroom. If the IEP team determines that the student can be appropriately educated in the general education classroom using modifications/supplementary aids and services, this is the L	Education & Reference

question_title: why is Ralph Ellison considered a part of southern literature ? [SEP] question_content: need  quick responses [SEP] best_answer: RALPH ELLISON\n\nIn 1936, a few weeks after my arrival in New York City, I was lucky enough to be invited by an old hero and newfound friend, Langston Hughes, to be his guest at what would be my introduction to Broadway theater. I was so delighted and grateful for the invitation that I failed to ask my host the title of the play, and it was not until we arrived at the theater that I learned that it would be Jack Kirkland's dramatization of Erskine Caldwell's famous novel Tobacco Road. No less successful than in its original form, the play was well on its way to a record-breaking seven-and-a-half-year run, and that alone was enough to increase my expectations. And so much so that I failed to note the irony of circumstance that would have as my introduction to New York theater a play with a southern setting and characters that were based upon a type and class of whites whom I had spent the last three years trying to avoid. Had I been more alert, it might have occurred to me that somehow a group of white Alabama farm folk had learned of my presence in New York, thrown together a theatrical troupe, and flown north to haunt me. But being dazzled by the lights, the theatrical atmosphere, the babble of the playgoing crowd, it didn't. And yet that irony arose precisely from the mixture of motives__ practical, educational, and romantic__ that had brought me to the North in the first place.\n\nAmong these was my desire to enjoy a summer free of the South and its problems while meeting the challenge of being on my own for the first time in a great northern city. Fresh out of Alabama, with my junior year at Tuskegee Institute behind me, I was also in New York seeking funds with which to complete my final year as a music major__ a goal at which I was having less success than I had hoped. However, there had been compensations. For between working in the Harlem YMCA cafeteria as a substitute for vacationing waiters and countermen and searching for a more profitable job, I had used my free time exploring the city, making new acquaintances, and enjoying the many forms of social freedom that were unavailable to me in Alabama. The very idea of being in New York was dreamlike, for like many young Negroes of the time, I thought of it as the freest of American cities and considered Harlem as the site and symbol of Afro-American progress and hope. Indeed, I was both young and bookish enough to think of Manhattan as my substitute for Paris and of Harlem as a place of Left Bank excitement.\n\nAnd yet I soon discovered, much to my chagrin, that while I was physically out of the South, I was restrained__ sometimes consciously, sometimes not__ by certain internalized thou-shalt-nots that had structured my public conduct in Alabama. It was as though I had come to the Eden of American culture and found myself indecisive as to which of its fruits were free for my picking. Beyond the borders of Harlem's briar patch__ which seemed familiar because of my racial and cultural identification with the majority of its people and the lingering spell that had been cast nationwide by the music, dance, and literature of the so-called Harlem Renaissance__ I viewed New Yorkers through the overlay of my Alabama experience. Contrasting the whites I encountered with those I had observed in the South, I weighed class against class and compared southern styles with their northern counterparts. I listened to diction and noted dress, and searched for attitudes in inflections, carriage, and manners. And in pursuing this aspect of my extracurricular education, I explored the landscape.\n\nI crossed Manhattan back and forth from river to river and up, down, and around again, from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Battery, looking and listening and gadding about; rode streetcar and el, subway and bus; took a hint from Edna Millay and spent an evening riding back and forth on the Staten Island Ferry. From the elevated trains I saw my first penthouses with green trees growi	Education & Reference

To solve the jamming problem, another business associate, James Densmore, suggested splitting up keys for letters commonly used together to slow down typing. This became today’s standard "QWERTY" keyboard.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what are bees doing in the winter time ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bees stay in their hives. Some die of course but more are produced to replace them. The worker bees exercise their wings and bodies to create enough heat to keep themselves and the queen warm enough to survive.These worker bees consume part of the honey in the nest to replace the energy lost by their activities in grooming the queen, caring for the larvae and keeping warm. They stay very close to the hive during winters.\n\nThis is why beekeepers never remove all the honey from a hive. Honey is the bees' method of laying in a food supply. A very long or very cold winter can kill a lot of the worker bees. The remainder will remain close to the queen to keep her and the larvae alive until the weather warms.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is homology? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Homology is a specific explanation of similarity of form seen in the biological world. Similarities can often be explained by common descent; features are considered homologous if they are shown to be inherited from a common ancestor. For example, although the arms of four-limbed vertebrates externally appear quite different, all have the same basic underlying skeletal and muscular pattern. Such shared patterns are best explained by the inference that they were inherited from a common ancestor that also had this pattern. Proposed homologies are evaluated using comparative anatomy, genetics, development, and behavior.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Did Sir Isaac Newton learn the secrets of gravity through his personal apprentice Rory Emerald? [SEP] question_content: Is this actually a fact or merely an opinion? What kind of relationship did Sir Isaac Newton have with Rory Emerald? Please tell me what you think? Isn't Emerald's discoveries just as important as Newton's? Thank You! [SEP] best_answer: Through a wild set of circumstances that took place in Beverly Hills, California, rumors started spreading that Rory Emerald, the famed celebrity, had aided Isaac Newton in his discovery of gravity.  It all started when a former silent film star, Fig Newton, started wandering the streets of Los Angeles, claiming to be a descendant of the famed scientist.  His delusions were met with skepticism, and he was finally institutionalized. Rory Emerald was doing some background research on his upcoming audition as “Frankie” for “Beach Blanket Bingo” and naturally went to the Sunnyville Mental Institution to interview psychiatric patients.  Rory Emerald was enchanted with Fig Newton and his claims.  After several months of continuous questioning, Rory Emerald began to realize that Fig Newton was not delusional - he was indeed a descendant of the famed scientist.  It all fit after painstaking research. \n\n It was then that Rory Emerald starting corresponding with Oxford University in England to discuss his findings.  He was amazed by his discovery, and anxious to share it with the scientific world.  Somehow, scientists at Oxford misinterpreted Rory’s letters and thought he was claiming to be an apprentice of Isaac Newton, and had come forward in time through a time machine to teach modern science.   Several scientists flew to Los Angeles immediately to meet the weary time traveler. These scientists held press conferences upon their arrival in the Golden State.  The media was shocked to discover that the man who assisted in the landmark discovery of gravity resided in their city in the year 1965.  They believed what they were told by the prestigious Oxford professors, and the news spread like wildfire throughout the city and the world.  \n\nRory Emerald was shocked to discover his name on the front pages of Variety, along with a full story of his time travel.  How did the story get so convoluted?  He was further appalled to learn that he was somehow involved with the discovery of gravity.  When he met the scientists from Oxford, they were naturally embarrassed by the actual story and pleaded with Rory Emerald to go along with them.  They taught him all of the correct scientific jargon and physics of gravity, and even designed a small bogus time machine made from a used dumpster, which appeared authentic.  Their sinister actions, along with Rory Emerald’s naïve compliance, started the biggest hoax perpetrated on the scientific world.  It was only 11 years later, when the hoax was exposed by a dying Oxford delegate.  By this time, Rory Emerald’s bizarre antics were accepted and he took very little flak over this indiscretion.  For the previous decade, Rory Emerald had basked in the role as “the Gravity Guru” and shamelessly exploited his fame to have many sexual encounters.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the effect of soapy water on plants? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If, in a drought crisis, you no longer have\nfresh water to irrigate outdoor plantings, can you\nuse dishwater, bathwater or laundry water\nwithout hurting the plants? \n\nYes, if you use\nreasonable care.\n\nBut, first, a warning: Household wash\nwater-also called "graywater"-contains food\nresidues and other organic matter that may attract\ninsects and rodents. It also may contain bacteria\nand viruses that could cause illness. Public health\nofficials have indicated that it may be used for\nhome irrigation-but only in localities where no\nother water is available for that purpose.\n\nHere are some guidelines: \n\n(1) The safest\nhousehold use of "graywater" is to flush toilets.\n(Don't put it in the tank; pour it directly into the\nbowl.) \n(2) Don't let it touch the edible parts of\nplants. \n(3) Use it only as a temporary measure\nduring a water shortage crisis.\nIn any case, check with your local health and\nbuilding officials before making any use of\n"graywater."\n\nEffects on plants\n\nHousehold wash water is much better for\nplants than no water at all, but there are possible\nproblems. If your home does not have a water\nsoftener, your bathwater and rinse water from\ndishes and laundry are all of good quality for\nirrigation. Soapy wash water from dishes and\nlaundry might better be saved to flush the toilet,\nbut can be used for irrigation if you're careful\nabout certain possible problems. \n\nSee the link below for additional information.

question_title: Which is heavier: a kilogram of feathers or a kilogram of lead? [SEP] question_content: Actually I wonder which is heavier: a kilogram of butter or a kilogram of lead?  Explain the solution if you had to demonstrate to your friends arbitrarily say in a middle of the New York City’s Central Park. \nRough ideas are accepted, but please be gentle. \nYou may check this site for information:\nhttp://hypertextbook.com/physics/matter/density/ [SEP] best_answer: If you asked a scientist you might get a different answer than if you asked a layman.  Let's compare a kilogram of lead with a kilogram of aluminum.  You likely would use the same scale to measure both samples.  But, the aluminum is much lighter and would take up far more space than the lead.  The samples would displace different amounts of air and the buoyancy of air would affect the scale readings by a small amount.  Therefore to obtain accurate measurements you must weigh the samples in a vacuum or calculate the buoyancy and compensate the weight measurements.  If this is true for lead and aluminum it is even more true for lead and feathers (or even lead and butter).  Chemists often do have to compensate for air buoyancy when measuring chemicals so that when they react none are left over.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does anyone have tips on how to sleep with PVCs or PACs? [SEP] question_content: Premature atrial and ventricular contractions are considered harmless by the 3 doctors and 2 cardiologists I've seen, but what a pain in the ass!  Those of you who are as unfortunate as me to actually feel every single one of them, how do you cope?  I can't sleep, and then being tired makes them worse.  I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.  If none of those work, you might at least get some consolation from others with similar problems.  The first link below is to a forum that seems to have a number of people with PVCs and PACs.

question_title: physics question help please!!!!!? [SEP] question_content: will the acceleration of a car be the same when the car travels around a sharp curve at a constant 60km/h as when it travels around a gentlecurve at the same speed? explain \n\nPLEASE!! [SEP] best_answer: Firstly, let me point out to you which answers are wrong and which answers are right. Otherwise you'll be just as confused as you were to begin with.\n\nThe first answer is confused. The second and third answers have no idea of what their talking about. The other answers are correct.\n\nHere's why the first answer is confused:\n\nSpeed and velocity use exactly the same units. \nSo it is perfectly acceptable to say "a car travels around a sharp curve a 60 km/hr". \n\nRestated, what we are saying is that the car moves around a curve at constant speed of 60 km/hr. The statement above does not include directional information. \n\n(However, suppose we said "a car travels around a sharp curve with constant velocity of 60 km/hr". Then, clearly this would be wrong. Velocity does change as it goes around the curve.)\n\nSecondly, let us recall some basic facts of 'Uniform Circular Motion' \nAn object that travels with Uniform Circular Motion has:\n- constant speed \n- changing velocity  \n- acceleration towards the centre\n\nNow, the car in question displays uniform circular motion. This is so even though we are considering a partial circular path.\n\nSo, we can use this import formula (you should memorise it) \n\n    ar = v ^2 /r\n\nThis relates the centripetal acceleration, ar, to the radius of the circle (or in the case of a partial circle, the radius of curvature), r.\n\nFrom the formula you can see that a sharp bend, i.e. a small r, will give a larger value of centripetal acceleration compared to a gentle bend, i.e a large r. \n\nSubstitute v=60 and different values of r into the formula above to verify this.

question_title: What causes the noise emitted from high-voltage power lines? [SEP] question_content: Is it static discharge, vibration from the 60-cycle field or something else entirely? [SEP] best_answer: "The audible noise emitted from high-voltage lines is caused by the discharge of energy that occurs when the electrical field strength on the conductor surface is greater than the 'breakdown strength' (the field intensity necessary to start a flow of electric current) of the air surrounding the conductor. This discharge is also responsible for radio noise, a visible glow of light near the conductor, an energy loss known as corona loss and other phenomena associated with high-voltage lines.

question_title: tricks for quickly inserting iv lines in ambulatory setting? [SEP] question_content: I'm starting a job at an amb. suregery center in a hospital, where every pt requires an iv. I usuallyenter the vein alright and get blood flashback, but have trouble advancing the catheter and frequently blow the vein.  I'm often able to float the catheter using the iv solution  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Starting IV's is an acquired skill that can take a while to really get the hang of. As a medic I have seen many different approaches to getting the stick on the first try. Allot of problems I see when people can't advance the catheter is because it isn't in the vein all the way. After you get flash in the angio chamber drop your angle and advance the catheter just alittle further. Then try advancing it. This will ensure that the catheter is in all the way. Another trick is to not hit the vein from the top. You can try a slight angle and hit it from the side. This will help with troublesome veins that roll on you. Hope this helps.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the proof of the big bang theory??? [SEP] question_content: How do you prove it actually happened or is it like a religion, and something you must have blind faith in? [SEP] best_answer: There is no actual proof as such although the evidence to support the theory is pretty convincing. The first piece of evidence is that the universe is observed to be expanding. Galaxies are observed to be receding from us. This is determined by the shift in their light to the red end of the visible spectrum. It's an effect you can hear with sound; as a vehicle approaches you blowing its horn you will hear the pitch of the sound change from high to low as it then travels away from you. It's called the Doppler effect. It aslo happens with light, only light changes colour from blue (coming towards you) to red (going away from you). The lightwaves are compressed and stretched just like sound.\n\nSince galaxies are moving away from us they must have been concentrated at one point in the distant past. That the singularity of the Big Bang.\n\nThe other piece of evidence is the background radiation of heat left over from the Big Bang. This was predicted to exist by proponents of the Big Bang, and was discovered accidentally in 1963. It's the leftovers of the tremendous heat generated by the explosion, and is 2.93 degrees above absolute zero.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how many kWh/m2 can solar generate? [SEP] question_content: how many kwh/m2 can solar  cell generate and how much is the cost of one square meter  of it [SEP] best_answer: in North America the average power of the solar radiation lies somewhere between 125 and 375 W/m², between 3 and 9 kWh/m²/day. [3]\n\nIt should be noted that this is the maximum available power, and not the power delivered by solar power technology. For example photovoltaic panels currently have an efficiency of ca. 15% and, hence, a solar panel delivers 19 to 56 W/m² or 0.45-1.35 kWh/m²/day (annual day and night average).\n\n\nGaAs multijunction devices are the most efficient solar cells to date, reaching as high as 39% efficiency[9]. They are also some of the most expensive cells per unit area (up to US$40/cm2).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Weird science question, coming up!? [SEP] question_content: okay if you have a human egg and a animal sperm can the human have a baby? and vice versa? Don't worry I'm not going to try it or anything it's just someone told me it was possible once. [SEP] best_answer: An unfertilized egg and a sperm each contain one half of a parents DNA.  The whole DNA is like a set of helical twisted ladders and the ladders are split down the rungs.  For conception to occur, the sperm and egg contributors must have the same number and length of ladder sections (similar genes) to be combined into new and unique human ladders, unlike either parent.  For example, a frog has far more genes than a human even though they are much smaller creatures.  That is the main reason it is impossible for a Princess to kiss a frog and make a Prince.  DNA must keep that within the realm of fairy tales <G>.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Which is healthier cycling or running? Which helps you lose more fat? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Running actually burns more calories, about 1,000 per hour on average compared with about 600 per hour cycling. Both are great forms of exercise but as several people have mentioned here running can be hard on the body. Cycling also has its down side. There can be loss of bloodflow to the pelvic region from sitting on seat for long periods of time. If you are going for weight loss the best thing to do would be both. Strictly focusing on one or the other will get your body into a routine and after a while you may stop seeing results. Doing both also gives you the option to do something else.	Sports

Also, if the Thoroughbred you're contemplating buying is a former racehorse, he/she may have soundness problems ranging from cracked or chipped bones to arthritis to torn ligaments or tendons.  Some of these things can be worked around, but some can't.  \n\nThe Thoroughbreds that I've known as riding horses have ranged from absolutely superb to borderline dangerous.  A lot depends on the quality of the training (or re-training, in the case of ex-racehorses) that they've had.  \n\nTo a very large degree, the kind of horse you want to have depends on what you want to do with it.  A good way to get an idea of the kind of horse you want is to look at horses that are doing what you want your horse to do, and see what kinds do well.\n\nA word to the wise:  a Thoroughbred can be a lot of horse to handle.  One of the quickest ways to get hurt, and hurt badly, around horses is to buy more horse than you can handle.  Horses absolutely do not care how well you think of your horsemanship skills.  A person can lie to other people and lie to themselves about how well they can handle a horse, but they can't lie to the horse.  Know your skill level and be honest about it when you're looking for a horse.  The most dangerous combination, an accident waiting to happen, is the unwary novice on a horse that's too much for his/her level of skill.	Sports
question_title: Howt o become a slugger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no real answer to this, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, practice - a lot!  When you do, work on keeping your weight on your back foot, transfering that weight forward with a minimal amount of stride.  Keep your hands back (ie don't lead the swing with your hands), start the swing from the bottom up.  What I mean here is transfer the weight from the back foot to the front, rotate the hips sligtly, then bring the bat through the strike zone with a short, compact swing (with a slight upper cut - do not exaggerate this), your head will be the last thing to pull through, allowing you to watch the ball hit the bat.\n\nThe key to slugging, isn't necessarily how big you are - though, increasing your size in a healthy way would be beneficial.  It's more about having a quick bat through the strike zone - the faster the bat, the harder you will hit the ball.  This does not equate to taking a HUGE swing - it's just not needed.\n\nFinally, get yourself playing on a field that has dimensions that are favourable to you.  If you are a lefty, a short right field porch is beneficial, and conversely, a righty will want a short porch in left.\n\nThat's it.  Simple right?  No, but hopefully this is helpful.	Sports

question_title: Why are there so many kids on the internet   much more than adults? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because kids are younger and they've learned less, as we get older we know certain ways to do things and its harder to re-learn to do them new ways than to keep doing them our old way, even if the new one is faster. kids are learning these things for the first time so they pick it up faster because they've got more space to put it and no previous experiences. thats why you must walk grandmothers thru even the easiest web-forms even tho they're designed for idiots. in short: adults dont usually like bothering learning new ways to do old things. besides, they know more stuff anyway, and have their lives in places besides home, who needs the internet?

question_title: George W. Bush? [SEP] question_content: For or Against? Why?\n\nThink about this! [SEP] best_answer: I approve of President George W. Bush. He is a man who always TELLS THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT and is a man who has a heart for other people, and understands what it means to be the President of the United States of America. I believe that if the former Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada Pierre Trudeau was still alive today, he would be proud of George W. Bush because both Bush and Trudeau asserted their countries identity to the world just as their country was going thought the worst crises in its history. For the United States, Bush asserted America’s identity to the world just as it was going through its toughest crises in its history on September 11, 2001. For Trudeau, he asserted Canada’s identity to the world when the October Crisis occurred in October 1970 from stopping the FLQ (Front de liberation du Quebec) from getting independence for Quebec.

question_title: Why are muslims so intolerant of christians? [SEP] question_content: Its so easy for them to declare jihad. Should christians retaliate? [SEP] best_answer: Certainly, not all of them are are... \n\nIn the cases they are though, so called Muslims (Muslim: believer, Islam: submission to God), believe that Christians are infidels; as in infidelity towards the religion of God as they see it, since they view Mohammad as the last Prophet. \n\nMost of those intolerant are of the elite ecclesiastical class (Imam: teacher), or the utterly ignorant because they're not even allowed to read the Koran or any other of their Holy books (which includes the Christian Bible) - the Koran is according to itself, another chapter of the continuing book of God, i.e. Bible and Torah are included in the Islamic book of God. \n\nMohammad is supposedly a Prophet like Moses, and His followers consequently have behaved like wise in their time, becoming persecutors/persecuted, but not all Jews were, nor are all Muslims today. (The books of Moses: Old testament, speak of a Prophet to arise in the place and time Mohammad did according to tradition "I shall raise up a Prophet, like unto me, Moses". \n\nThose that are not intolerant remember the sayings, or those like it that Mohammad stated "Anyone who harms a Christian or Jew has harmed me!", or "Be friends with the Christians for they are most like you in the world", or when asked what is this God you believe in, Mohammad said "The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." \n\nAbraham also had the Q'blih "point of adoration", a stone to turn to when praying for those unable to be without an alter, since both were from idol worshipers; as were the Jews before the ten commandments - the commandments Moses received before, He tossed into the water because the people were not ready (a sign of the coming of greater teaching, e.g. with Jesus).\n\nThere's always more to learn and understand. Some Muslims I've met show such Love for Christ that all but two Christians I've met pale by comparison - those two spoke of nothing but the love of God and had no hate for anyone. In generally the Muslims I've met here in the US are every bit as loving toward all, as Christians, and by that standard they are one and the same.	Society & Culture

question_title: Another important christians for christians.? [SEP] question_content: "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” [The Bible, Mathew 7:22-24]\n\n \n\nIn the verses quoted above, Jesus (pbuh) said that in his second coming, he would ask the people to depart from him, to get away from him because he wouldn’t know them. Who are these people? The Muslims or the Hindus? The answer is neither Hindus nor Muslims but the Christians, because Muslims or Hindus do not claim to do “Miracles” in the name of Jesus Christ (pbuh) nor do they cast out devils in his name.\nPLZ TELL WHAT CHRISTIANS THINK ABT THIS? [SEP] best_answer: I see where you are going with this, but your logic is faulty.\n\nYes - He is saying that some people will claim to know Him, but as he just got done saying a few verses earlier, they won't have been doing the will of His Father, and which means they don't truly know Him, they only think they do.\n\nTwo observations:\n\n1)  That does not mean that all Christians will not be acknowledged by the Messiah - only that some who claim to be Christians won't.\n\n2)  That does not mean that there are any other ways to God.  Jesus was also very clear about that:\n\n  * John 3:36 "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."\n\n   * John 14:6 "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me"\n\nI see that you honor Jesus as a Prophet, when you write "PBUH" (Peace Be Unto Him) after His name.  How do handle the knowledge that Jesus claimed to: 1) have the authority to forgive sins (something only God can do), 2) said He and the Father were one (John 10:30), and 3) claimed God granted him the authority to lay down his life  - and - take it up again (John 10:17-18).\n\nIgnoring whether or not He proved those things with the Resurrection (and there is evidence He did), these claims are very bold.  I can see two possibilities.  Either 1) These were not true (in which case you should not be saying "Peace Be Unto Him" every time you mention his name, for he was a Blasphemer, or 2) What he said was true, and he was God in human form come to save mankind.\n\nAs a Muslim, how do you handle that?

Your folks probably don't need to know either. Masturbation is a perfectly natural function of the body & humans are not the only ones who do that. What he chooses as stimuli is very personal, as is what he was doing. If you speak to him at all about it, you might just suggest that he be more careful to lock the door before he indulges. Also, you could make a bigger attempt to respect his privacy - but Please, don't tell all his friends - that really would be evil.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Every one feels u have the answer for this and it is easy , but when u try to relate it to ones own life one would find no that  comfortable to answer it by saying it is ok or its perfectly fine. [SEP] best_answer: I hate to look at things this way, but I'm a factual person. The stats show that ppl who live together before getting married are more likely to get divorced. I waited until I was married to have sex. This brings a real sense of security to our relationship. I could go on about the other benefits, but I'm tired.	Family & Relationships

question_title: state funding? [SEP] question_content: If the state gives so much of are taxes to county program to help people why is it so hard to get help? [SEP] best_answer: Possibly because of past abuse of help program funds, they are overly cautious about giving it out now.  I felt a little daunted by the amount of paperwork for the application process I am now going through, but it was minimal compared to what I got when I looked at financial aid for community college.\n\nGood luck to you and persevere until you get what you need!

question_title: is being gay a sin? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Truthfully, I think that if a person looks hard enough they can find sin in everything and everyone.  The interesting thing is that people who spend their lives looking for sin in others rarely, if ever, find sin within themselves.  Personally I find it important to remember these two things:\nFirst, man not God placed a rating on sin.  In the eyes of God the person who lies is just as much a sinner as the person who murders.  So, in that regard, have we not all sinned?\nSecond there are my two favorite verses from the bible:\nMatthew 7:1-5\nJudge not, that ye be not judged. \nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. \nAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\nLuke 6:37-38\nJudge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \nGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it possible to see your period one month after you put to birth while breatfeeding, how to prevent pregnan? [SEP] question_content: That is, to avoid pregnancy using natural control method not artificial. how to count save and unsave days [SEP] best_answer: If you are going to use this method for birth control, prepare for another pregnancy. It does not work, at least not very well. You need to use some form of birth control, either condoms, or the pill. You are MOST fertile, halfway through your cycle, day14, 15 , and 16........but you can STILL get pregnant other days, even while on your period, if you have sex.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Proposed New ABORTION Law? [SEP] question_content: Women can only get abortion if the man agrees, or she is proven to be raped or under age or in the case of saving a life.\n\nIf the father does not agree he must pay the mother an amount during her pregnancy and medical bills and must have full custody of the child after it is born, then the mother must pay child support.\n\nIf no case can be proven and the mother gets an abortion the father can sue for damages for his lost child. [SEP] best_answer: In my opinion it sounds like a good law. Its may be the womans body, but its the mans sperm. If the father wants to take care of his daughter/son then he should be able to. The woman and man created the baby, not just the woman.	Family & Relationships
question_title: how do u know your boy friend really loves you? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Since I don't know your boyfriend personally, it's hard to offer good advice.  I think that some of the following guidelines would show whether or not he loves you:\n\n1)  Does he respect your wishes and morals, or does he try to pressure you into activities and ideas that he knows that you are not in favor of?  A guy who loves you will respect your wishes, even if his wishes are different than yours.  He will not try to pressure you into doing something that you have already said "no" to.\n2)  Does he ever say, "If you loved me, you'd... (fill in the blank)" or something similar?  If he has, he's using you.\n3)  A guy that loves and cares for you will encourage you to be your best self, and look out for your best interests.\n\nHope that helps.	Family & Relationships

question_title: fire destroyed my house..what to do? [SEP] question_content: i was renting in CA in 2006. single family home. the AC unit cause a spark in the attic and burnt down my entire house. my cat and dog died in fire. \nthe official fire report states fire was started by AC, it also states we've made several complaints to landlord about weird electrical outages in various parts of the house (he never took any action to fix it). but in the fire report, he says he has fixed it.\nand now, the whole house is non-repairable. \nwe didn't have renters insurance, but landlord has insurance on the house. i think he's fighing insurance for his share of the loss (the ttl loss is around $800,000). he has not even made an attempt to call us since the fire happened 3 months ago.  \ni want to know if we have any hope of getting our losses back by getting legal action again landlord for unsafe living for past year. i just want to get some money so i can start out new again.\nthanks for your input in advance. [SEP] best_answer: There's really not a whole lot that a landlord is responsible for but I can tell you that they are responsible for providing a safe place to live which includes plumbing and electrical.  Even if you don't have any written documents showing you complained about the electrical stability, it will be his word against yours and since he never fixed it, he won't have any receipts.\n\nMy advice is to get a lawyer.  You shouldn't have too much trouble finding one if the house if worth $800,000.  The lawyer should take it on a contingency fee (they get paid when you get paid).  If your claim is less than $5,000 you can take him to small claims court.  If you win you can put a lien against the property until he pays you.  Your winnings will also collect 10% annual interest until paid.  Also, if he tries to sell the property you will get you money before he gets his.	Business & Finance

question_title: what should I do? [SEP] question_content: What should I do after work? Go to the gym, go to the groceries with mommy, watch a movie with a friend (if so, should we watch Lakehouse, or Nacho Libre?), or should I just stay home and play ps2 and sleep? [SEP] best_answer: You should read.  Read a good book, or something so that you can learn.  Going to the gym is good, but not all of the time.  Movies and video games are too, and occasionaly an extra nap - although if you would go to the gym more often you wouldn't need to sleep as much.  Here are some books that I've read that were pretty good:  "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, along with the other books in the series: "Speaker for the Dead", "Xenocide", and "Children of the Mind".  They were really interesting, and really fun to read.  Then there is the "Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy" series by Douglas Adams.  Really funny:  a lot better than the newer movie:  I read the book before even any trailers came out, and it was really good.  Then, there are some classic books that are pretty good.  Mark Twain is really great; maybe a book of short stories.  Reading is great, man.  If you're not into reading, go to the gym and then play PS2, so you get more than one activity in.

You may be able to post something on their bulletin boards.  \n\nIf your parents are involved in some type of group, ask if they will spread the word to others in the group.  They may be permitted to spread the word at work as well.

question_title: can i start a business with great ideas but no cash in hand? [SEP] question_content: i want to start a good life within this year [SEP] best_answer: There are many businesses who started with so little yet grew to become good income vehicles down the road. From the article "How to Start a Business with Little Cash" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol30/nocash.htm  here are some tips on how you can start a business and earn more money even if you are short of cash today:\n\n1. Find a business that you can start for little money (e.g. an errand business where your main cost is telephone and gasoline is easier to start than starting a Subway franchise)\n\n2. Consider your time and effort - if you have little cash, you may have to work harder for the money because you will have no resource to outsource or employ others to do certain tasks for you; or you have no money to buy equipment so you can only do certain things the long way\n\n3. Get your creative juices flowing. With no money, the only thing you have is your imagination. Be creative and find ways to get things done \n\n4. Be prepared to do all the work yourself - from doing your business plan, finding financing, writing emails, shipping and handling, marketing or whatever processes your business requires. \n\n5. Be prepared to invite investors - you may need financing help from someone down the road so be prepared to share some of the pie. \n\nOther recommended articles:\nHow to Build a Business from Scratch http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol18/scratch.htm\n10 Rules for Bootstrapping Your Business http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol70/shoestringrules.htm	Business & Finance

question_title: how do you keep pimples from breaking out? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's impossible to keep pimples from breaking out that's apart of puberty and life, but to prevent them from coming then eat fruits and vegetables drink water, have a healthier way of eating.  Pimples are caused by the pores being clogged and by producing too much oil or sebum from your sebaceous glands that can form either a white head or a black head.  So wash your face with something that has benzol peroxide in it or salic acid, and use an on the spot acne medication, The best stuff to use depends on your face type whether you have dry or oily skin or a combination of both.  So you have to find a cleanser that won't overdry your skin, or make it too oily.  Recommended products Neutrogena on the spot acne cream, only has 2.5 % benzol peroxide so it won't dry your skin too much, and Clearsil daily face wash guarenteed to clear skin in 3 days.  That's the cheap route, and it works.  Other than that you can use an astringent or toner all of them are pretty much the same but some can overdry your skin so you just have to test them to see which ones are best for your facial type, and those are good to use after doing some sweating and with make-up to take it off.  Sometimes having too much make-up on can clog your pores so use a light base so that none of the cosmetics can still be left behind.  Last, wash your face in the shower, and you don't need to use everything morning and night, You'll notice if you need to wash more than once a day, if it overdrys your skin, or if your skin is too oily.  Use the on the spot medication at night only so that your skin won't feel tight and dry all day long.	Business & Finance

question_title: y do Iran looks for nuclear weapon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I dont think Iran looks for nukes now as they always claim they are looking for nuclear plants for electricity but it is also true that the process of enrichment of uranium will enable Iran to make nukes specially with blue prints that CIA gave Iran for making nukes some years ago.\nit also must be noted that after decompositon of USSR there are vast amount of uranium on sale on underground military black market and Iran was able to buy some and I think it already have and also Iran has missles which can target Israel from its northern borders so if they really want to wipe Israel they can.\nFact that I want to tell is some of famous Israel leaders are born and grown in Iran and Israel is originally enemy of arab countries which Iranians have problems with them for so long.\n The most hostile act of Iranian governments is some support for anti israel groups specially palastinians which I think is comparable with US budget for overthrowing Iran government and I think both parties gain more from each other.\nits exactly similar to cold war where both parties have nukes but the only output was some James Bond movies.

[SEP] question_content: My car was shot 5 times, I called the police as the guy walked away and got a ride to his vehical. The cops came, I explained and they saw the car, then left to track down the shooter who was found driving out of town, DUI, cocked and loaded concealed 9mm with hammer pulled back, possession of M.J., and a specialty assault snipper rifle, and his story says we had a shootout. No shells other than his were found at the scene.

question_title: What is an instrument that searches emergency channels? [SEP] question_content: i think it might be police something or something police or maybe anttenia if you think it's anntena could you spell it right for me. [SEP] best_answer: its called a police scanner... you can access any police, fire, EMS, or private channels with it. you need an antenna which has to be secured to the exterior of your vehicle (assuming you want it for a car). police scanners allow a person to only listen... you aren't allowed to speak on these channels, or access them in any way unless you have fire department/ police department credentials. you can access your local fire/ police websites and it will tell you what channel they are broadcasting at. although a heads up... if you dont understand police and fire radio code then it is pointless to get a radio. you can get a small scanner at radio shack, or other electronic stores for about 150 dollars. there are only a few that are commercially available to the general public, and are usually in the range from 100 to 400 dollars. your most basic scanner will be able to do anything you can need though, because it provides access to hundreds of channels, and will give you a chance to select your favorite channels.

Are these Conservative values, and is America for sale to the "Enemy". I was taught all my life Communism is Athiest, or with-out GOD. Is this a Christian man? [SEP] best_answer: Bush is no Christian, if he was he would not allow all these things to happen to our country. I believe that this man was born to destroy America. The first thing he did was to take the surplus, that everyone in this country worked so hard for, and distribute it amongs his round table friends. Thank God he was not given a chance to put our Social security dollars in the stock market, a place where his frinds could make billions more on the hard working class. Given enough time, this man would cause more damage to our country, and the world, than the evil Hitler himself.....KECK	Politics & Government
question_title: Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? [SEP] question_content: In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? [SEP] best_answer: By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at "SoundPolitics.com")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: "the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . "  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure "conspired" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that "there must be something to it".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this "conspiracy" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a "bubble" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much 	Politics & Government
