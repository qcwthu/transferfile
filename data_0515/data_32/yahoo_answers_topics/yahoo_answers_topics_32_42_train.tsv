And she may have support from a lot of gays and lesbians because even they are sick of Clay not coming out. This may make him want to come out anyway.\nAlso, I think Rosie against Jackie. Jackie is the personal trainer to the stars that has her show on Bravo called "Work Out" (if I am not mistaken) and not only would she beat the s'hit out of Rosie, but, tell her to get her fat a'ss on a treadmill and lose a good 20lbs!

question_title: Why did Itachi Uchiha kill his clan? [SEP] question_content: I'm just asking away. I know the answer but I'm just doing this 'cuz I'm bored. [SEP] best_answer: Noted even within the Bingo Book (a list of powerful ninja who have been marked for assassination because of their crimes), Uchiha Itachi is an S-Class criminal and a Konoha Nukenin. He graduated at the top of his Academy class at age 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chūnin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions and the English Anime) squad leader at the age of only 13.\n\nHe left Konoha about five years prior to the setting of Naruto, after slaying his whole clan, sparing only Uchiha Sasuke, his little brother. At 17, he was feared by even Orochimaru. He is now currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planned to use Itachi's body as a new container for his soul, but Itachi's power had grown to such a frightening extent that Orochimaru dared not carry out his plan, and decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with the younger Sasuke instead.\n\nThe reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left only his brother Sasuke alive, still remains unclear. When questioned by Sasuke, he replied "To test my 'Utsuwa'." In Japanese, 'Utsuwa' (器) can mean "Vessel," or "Container," but it can also mean "Ability," or "Tool." Orochimaru uses this word to refer to the bodies he takes over with his Fushi Tensei no Jutsu ("Living Corpse Reincarnation"). In this respect, Itachi's words can mean anything from him having a past connection with Orochimaru, to him simply wanting to test his own power, or to his plans to join Akatsuki and forsake past relations. To make matters even more ambiguous, the first person pronoun Itachi used can also be used as a vulgar second person pronoun. So he could also have meant that he wanted to test Sasuke's 'Utsuwa,' although this is unlikely, given his previous remarks about his 'Utsuwa'.\n\nHe was until recently the only known person who possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a different-looking Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga, but to what extent they share abilities is unknown. Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total three. It is unknown who the second person Itachi is referring to, as this statement was made before Kakashi obtained his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n\nDespite being the murderer of his entire clan as well as his best and closest friend, a top member of Akatsuki, and a shinobi capable of putting an adult shinobi to sleep at a mere glance; Itachi is by no means a cold blooded murderer looking for any excuse to kill someone in their way. When Sarutobi Asuma and Yūhi Kurenai stood between him and the way to his goal (Uzumaki Naruto), he did not kill Kurenai when given the chance, though he did wound her enough for her to remember it; as well as trap her within her own Genjutsu.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.	Business & Finance

They said once check clears to give them a call. I have been having alot of money problems and I thought that finally I could get out of them with this check. [SEP] best_answer: If you deposited a check thinking it was a real check, then you did not commit check fraud. If the bank cleared it then to me that is an indication that it is a real check. The bank is the one who should be able to tell yo if it is real. You got scammed, don't EVER PAY for a prize, or a JOB, in advance! They're always scams!  Talk to a lawyer ASAP!	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I get over my fear of flying.  Have tried alcohol, drugs, pschology and hypnotherapy but no luck yet!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I will be honest.  After a very bad flight 30 years ago, on which I was scared out of my wits, I swore I would never fly again.   This continued until about eight years ago when my best friend died home in Ireland.  There was no other way of getting to his funeral other than flying.  I did so and I can only say that I now feel sorry for all the years I have wasted driving long distances, using Ferries when I could have been to far away places enjoying my holidays better than in fact I did.  I fly everywhere now.\nI discovered that the trick was to face my fear.  I forced myself to sit next to a window and watched everything from take off to the flying and up to the landing.  I know that what I say may seen to you to be of no use in your position but I would say take a short flight and face your fears. Good luck.	Business & Finance

Some sites by their very topic and nature do well with Adsense, but some are really a poor fit.\n\nMy suggestion is to increase the number of ad units you have on your page. Your homepage only has a leaderboard, yet your page is VERY LONG. Have another unit in the middle and another at the bottom. You can also add an Ad Links to your 3 ad formats.	Business & Finance

question_title: How to be popular? [SEP] question_content: I'm not most popular at my school but I wish I was. Please, how to be popular? [SEP] best_answer: Popularity is merely nothing more than a contest. If you wish to engage in such simple, closed minded, shallow activity then change yourself. I remember high school (well, some of it) and all the most "popular" people were always striving to be someone or something they were not. Constantly concerned with their appearance, concerned with the way others viewed them. And worse yet, they were quite the epitomy of phoney. In my opinion is was sad, pathetic and disheartening. \nIf you wish to have more friends then take the advice of liveevilone666 above. Open up more, talk often, ask questions, smile A LOT. \nDo not though, change who you are. You are an individual who deserves respect and kindness just as much as anyone else. If the "popular" people don't see you such then it's their loss...not your's. \nBe yourself...love yourself exactly as you are. If and when you do that, you'll be amazed how many more people will be simply clammering for your attention.	Business & Finance

question_title: Why does college education mean little when looking for a job; everyone seems to value experience more? [SEP] question_content: I graduated from a good university in August. And although my major is in art, I did achieve high academic honors in college and in high school. I have posted my resume on many websites, I have a couple of recruiters, and I visited with  my college counslers (they were of the least help). In an attempt to stay well educated, I read Forbes, Inc., and several newspapers; I am determined to achieve success within any career. \n\nEven the people who give me the interview opportunity seem to say I do not have enough experience. I want experience, how do I get experience if no one will hire me? I've focused my attention on a wide variety of career fields, and so far I have turned up empty. What can I do to get my foot in the door? [SEP] best_answer: You might be viewing your degree in the wrong light.  How people see a degree is that someone can commite to something. \n\n Your next step is to focus on what you want to do and even volenteer your time to get just a little experience and that can make more of a difference that you might think.\n\nAt your old college you can go back and see about helping out with things in your degree field and that is viable experience as well.

question_title: why is it called quitting cold turkey? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One site states, "The state addicts are in when withdrawing from drug addition, especially heroin. Origin: In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.idiomsite.com/coldturkey.htm)\n\nAnother site explains, "This phrase meaning "without preparation" dates to 1910. The use in relation to withdrawal from an addictive substance (originally heroin) dates to around 1922. The derivation is from the idea that cold turkey is a food that requires little preparation in the kitchen. So to quit like cold turkey is to do so suddenly and without preparation. It is also boosted by the image of the pallid flesh of a cold, dead, plucked turkey. In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.allexperts.com/previousqv.asp?QuestionID=2633904)\n\nYet another site says, "'Cold turkey' is actually based on another colloquial phrase, "to talk turkey" (sometimes "to talk cold turkey"), meaning to face unpleasant truths squarely. It's not entirely clear how turkeys came to be associated with honesty and straightforward confrontation of difficulties, but it may simply be that turkey farmers were renowned at one time for their lack of pretense and blunt speech."

question_title: Why do really wealthy people get tax breaks, whereas 'normal' people have to pay it all? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'll assume that by wealthy, you mean people earning above $95,000 and are therefore on the top tax rate of 47%. Therefore, everytime you give them a tax break (such as a deduction for donations), they will save $47 in tax for every $100. For the normal person who is on the 30% bracket, they will only save $30 in tax for every $100 they donate. Tax breaks for the wealthy tend to more beneficial because they are already paying a high amount of tax. Tax breaks for the normal person don't look so impressive, because they pay a lower rate.\n\nIt may be because these 'normal' tax breaks are so unimpressive that the government of the day knows that people don't care on election day about the 'sandwich and a milkshake' tax break.

question_title: What are some drawbacks and benefits of bilingual education in California? [SEP] question_content: The question is referring to grades K-12. [SEP] best_answer: May/June 1998\n\nBilingual Education and California's "English for the Children" Initiative: Researchers, Practitioners, and Policymakers Debate the Issues\n\nOn June 2, California voters will decide whether to eliminate bilingual education in their state. Proposition 227, also known as the "English for the Children" initiative or the Unz initiative after the name of its chief sponsor, proposes replacing current bilingual programs with a maximum of one year of "sheltered English immersion" (see "Models of Language Instruction"). In this case, parents would have to explicitly ask for their children to be placed in native-language programs.\n\nIf Proposition 227 passes, it could lead to a seismic shift in educating the nation's largest population of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. With 1.4 million LEP students in the state, California is home to nearly half of the nation's population of young English learners. In March 1998, the state board of education gave school districts local control of decisions about educating LEP students. However, if Proposition 227 passes, it would override any other provisions.\n\nIn an effort to advance the dialogue about how best to educate students who do not speak English, the Harvard Education Letter asked some key supporters and opponents of the California ballot initiative to share their perspectives:	Education & Reference

What is so hard about this even after we have spent two weeks on learning how. [SEP] best_answer: To be able to use a tool to accomplish a task, you need to know about the task.  Ignorance of the task is one fundamental problem that instructors trying to introduce the concept of functions have to face.\n\nA good way to do it is take up a task (say calculating interest), let them know the parameters involved (what we call variables in math).. and how the result is derived manually.  \n\nNow, if they are made to understand that excel/spreadsheet is a tool that would enable them to accomplish that same task .... may be they would be able to get along .....

[SEP] best_answer: The only thing positive that I can say about my school experiences is that they have strengthened my resolve that no child of mine will ever attend a public school and that I will homeschool if at all possible.\n\nEverything I have learned academically has been learned either from my parents (reading, early math skills, and the ability to engage in logical argument) or from self study (everything else).  \n\nMost of what I learned at school was social and most of it was wrong. \n\nMy school experiences taught me that to be accepted by society you have to look and think like everyone else.  They taught me that I am living in a world where you have to live in a constant mood of defensiveness and that you always work with people who are about your age, from the same part of town, and that most of those people will be living at my economic level and be of the same race and nationality. Finally I learned that if you believe in God than you are wrong and will be punished for practicing your religion and that this only applies to religions stemming from the judeo/Christian tradition.  \n\nI graduated high school in 1992.  The real world has taught me that you work with people who have different ways of thinking, are of a variety of ages, are of variety of races, and come from a variety of socio-economic, and religious backgrounds.

Find the probability of choosing blue, then yellow.\npossible choices...2/24. 2/3, 1/9, 2/27.\n\nNow suppose you choose one but don't replace the first pick. Find the probability of choosing blue then red. \npossible answers...6/17, 1/9, 8/81, 1/12\n\nNow find the probability of choosing yellow then blue. \npossible answers...1/7, 1/12, 2/27, 5/17. [SEP] best_answer: A) This one is slightly tricky.  The probability of gettng a blue ball is 3/7.  The probability of getting a ball with "4" on it is 2/7.  I want a blue ball or one with a "4", so it seems like 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/7 is correct.  However, this counts the blue #4 ball twice.  So I need 3/7 (probability of blue) + 2/7 (probability of "4") - 1/7 (probability of a blue "4") = 4/7.\n\nB) Probability of blue on the first draw is 2/9.  Probability of yellow on second draw is 3/9.  You want blue AND yellow, so 2/9 x 3/9 = 2/27.\n\nC) You are not replacing.  So probability of getting blue on first draw is 2/9, but red on second draw is 4/8 (there are only eight pencils left--one has been removed).  You want blue AND red, so 2/9 x 4/8 = 1/9.\n\nD) You didn't say whether to use replacement or not.  Yellow on first draw is 3/9, and blue on second draw (without replacement) is 2/8, so 3/9 x 2/8 = 1/12.  However, if you are going to use replacement, yellow on first draw is 3/9 and blue on second draw is 2/9, so 3/9 x 2/9 = 2/27 (which is also a possibility).  Since this comes right after the problem stating that you do not use replacement, I would go with 1/12 on this one.	Education & Reference

question_title: are there any grants for higher education for convicted felons? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You could be eligible for several types of Federal aid, depending on your situation.\n\nIf you currently incarcerated, you might be eligible for a Federal SEOG (Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant) and, in some cases, a Pell Grant. (Your eligibility for Pell depends on the type of institution in which you are incarcerated. People in federal and state penal institutions aren’t eligible for Pell grants, but students in local penal institutions are eligible.) \n\nIf you're not incarcerated, your eligibility for both loans and grants depends on the nature of your offense. The law imposes restrictions on drug offenses: If you were convicted of possession or sale of illegal drugs at the same time that you were receiving federal student aid, you won't be eligible for federal aid until AT LEAST one year since your conviction, as follows:\n\nIf you were convicted for possession, and it was your first offense, you are eligible to federal aid one year from the date of your conviction. If you were convicted for selling (and it was your first offense), you must wait 2 years from your conviction date.... If you have more than one offense for selling or more than 2 offenses for possession, you can only regain eligibililty for federal student aid funds after you complete a certain type of rehab program. If you're not incarcerated and the above doesn't apply to you, you should be OK to receive aid.\n\nFederal aid aside, it is possible that there are scholarships out there for people looking to start anew -- perhaps some specific your circumstances. Try searching www.fastweb.com for organizations that help people looking to give people a second chance. I'm sure there are some out there.	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: My fiance is about to go in and have surgey done on his eyes..what is it like, does it work and how painfull is it? [SEP] best_answer: I had mine done years ago and I love it.  However, not everyone who gets it done comes out perfect, my mom is having trouble with her peripheral vision and she gets bad night reflective glares, but the rest of my family are fine too.  Lasik technology has also gotten much better these days though.  \n\nIt's such a quick procedure, like 10 minutes, and you don't feel a thing except afterwards it stings for a day or two, it feels like you have something stuck in your eye or you scratched it, cuz it's your cornea healing from the incision, but they give you eyedrops and painkillers for it.

question_title: Is there going to be any possible cure for cancer some time soon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There always seems to be a new breakthrough.  Little by little traditional cancer research is gaining ground.  As far as soon?  That would take a major breakthrough.  But look at the rise in technology over  the past 100 years, and then the past decade.  We have not only more educated and then knowledgeable brains working on it, but think about the knowledge that isn't being lost now when someone  in the research field dies.  You don't have to go searching for a book for answers, it's right there on a computer.  Quick access has made knowledge so readily available that the rise in medical technology should continue to spike off the charts.   So, at the rate it's going the past predictions of stating a cure may be found in 50 years could be reduced to "some time soon"er than anyone thought.	Health

question_title: I know it may sound stupid because I'm just 13 years old, but... how can I lose weight? [SEP] question_content: I'm obesessed with losing weight. I don't know who to believe, because my family says I'm thin and I don't need to lose any weight, but when I look in the mirror I always see a fat girl. Oh, and what parents would say to their children that they are fat and ugly, anyway? [SEP] best_answer: You are right, what parent would tell their child they were fat!?\n\nDo one thing, next time you are at the doctor's office have the nurse weigh you and then ask the doctor how you compare to other healthy girls your age.  Then you will know if you are just being crazy or if you should watch what you eat.\n\nIf you should watch what you eat, then try this first:\n\nStop drinking sodas!(or pick the worst thing you do regularly, like eat french fries, or drink whole milk and stop that one thing).\n\nThen do this next:\n\nReplace your worst habit with a good habit.  Drink diet sodas (I know sometimes they taste bad, but it is better than nothing, even if it isn't quite as good as drinking a lot of H20).\n\nEasy right!  Just stop one thing and replace it with one thing.  Do it until you feel you love what you do.  It will help you to feel a bit skinnier, and successful.  You are being healthy!  Awesome.  Now, you can try another thing...like....you be creative.....always improving is what it is all about.\n\nOne last thing; if a new food or habit should come along (ie smoking) save yourself the trouble of having to quit it in the future.....don't start bad habits.  Don't start being addicted to cheesecake if you aren't already.\n\nLearn moderation while you are young, you will be so happy with yourself when you turn 30.  Haha.\n\nGood luck my friend	Health

question_title: Can ear candling damage the inner ear? [SEP] question_content: I have been wanting to try ear candling for quite some time as I believe it will improve my hearing, but I can't really find any information about possible damage it could cause from something such as over-drying sensitive membranes or anything of that sort. Any advice is appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: Candling poses several dangers, the most serious of which involve burning caused by the hot wax. Candle manufacturers claim that their candles will drip only down the outside of the ear, but shamefully few direct the user to hold the candle horizontally to prevent this. A 1996 survey of 144 ear, nose, and throat physicians, found that 14 had seen patients who had been harmed by ear candling, including at least 13 cases of external burns, 7 cases of ear canal obstruction with candle wax, and 1 perforated eardrum [3].\n\nAnother case was reported by The London Free Press, a Canadian newspaper. A woman who experienced stuffiness in the nose and ear pains while scuba diving went to a local health-food store and was referred to a "qualified" candler. During the "treatment," she felt an intense burning in her ear. At the emergency room, attempts to remove wax that had dripped from the candle onto her eardrum failed. Surgery was required, and a hole in her eardrum was discovered, which presumably was caused by the procedure. She recovered fully, and luckily her hearing was not affected. The practitioner apologized, compensated the woman, and stopped performing ear coning [4].\n\nAlaska Fire Marshall Gary L. Powell has reported two instances of significant fires associated with ear candling., one of which led to the user's death. On January 27, 2005 a 59-year-old woman ignited her bedding when she dropped an ear candle that she was attempting to use the ear without any assistance. The candle ignited the bedding and quickly spread to curtains and other combustibles in the room. The woman did escaped but suffered an asthma attack and died in a hospital emergency room [5].	Health

question_title: how to gain weight with having fast metabolism? [SEP] question_content: if I eat more i vist the restroom more often or few times a day if i don't then i go every couple days. so what should i do? [SEP] best_answer: The key here is slow down your metabolism....and the way to do that is to eat less meals during the day but eat bigger meals when you do eat. This way your body has too much food to digest and your body stores the fat longer. Obviously the more unhealthy the meal the better for weight gain...however you don't mention the reason for you wanting to gain weight.\n\nIf it is a medical condition such as your thyroid then nothing will help to rectify your weight but medical help.\n\nAlso there are plenty of products on the market at the moment such as shakes to drink etc which help to build muscle....maybe try one of them, or even drinking beer adds on the pounds!!

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Usually, (but NOT always) hot babes spend all the time on themselves and not have any "family" skills.  In addition they would make any man turn twice and sometimes make us doubt their sincerity towards us or our relationship.   The perfect woman is the supportive spouse, the caring mother and the awesome lover.

question_title: can you find someone attractive without being attracted to them? [SEP] question_content: There was this man I worked with, he was in his 40's and I was/am in my 20's, who always flirted with me and acted interested.  The girls at work would tell me that he'd always gush about me, how cute and sweet I was.  However, we never dated and he never asked me on a date.  I was wondering, is it possible that he found me attractIVE but wasn't attractED to me?  I just thought it was kind of weird... [SEP] best_answer: I think that guy was just interested in flirting with you because you were younger.  He might have just wanted to see if he could get a response from you, or maybe he just wanted to get into your pants.\n\nIt is possible to think someone is attractive without being attracted to them.  I think some of my male friends are attractive, but I am not interested in anything other than friendship with them.  I also think that some of my female friends are attractive, but I am "straight" and not interested in them either.  \n\nI'd say it noticing how people look, and how they look to you.\nYou don't have to act on it.  But if you do, ie you go after everyone you think is attractive, then you have issues and people will not think very much of you.  That's my theory.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Public Marital Put-Down? [SEP] question_content: What does it mean when your spouse puts down married life in front of your friends while you're right there? \nAnd what do you do about it? [SEP] best_answer: That may be his sense of humor.  Something he thinks he is expected to do around "the guys".  There is a stigma around marriage that it should be miserable.  Your hubby may be one of those who wants to fit in so he subscribes to the stereotypes people hold of him and his life.  (I could be wrong)\n\nIn private I would tell him that what he said really bothered you.  Ask him if he really feels that way or if he was just trying to be funny.  Inform (gently not confrontationaly) that it wasn't funny and jokes as such really hurt you, especially around other people.  If he really feels that way it may be time for some marriage counseling.

[SEP] best_answer: Ok i'm not a guy so I can't give you a guy's point of view but, from my point of view, I think that's really sweet what you are trying to do. And she must be an amazing woman because it sounds like you really love her and don't want to lose her. Please don't take what I'm fixing to write to offense, but I think if yall are in college I wouldn't give her the promise ring. Reason being, yall aren't 15-16 years old anymore. Yall are in college, old enough to do what yall want live together old enough to get married. A promise ring to me is for teenagers. If yall already talked about what you want when you get of college and including getting married, go with the engagement ring. Trust me, well I'm not your girlfriend, but I'm sure she will feel and understand what I'm telling you. Now because I said don't get the promise ring for her get the engagement ring doesn't mean you have to do that. This yall's life you make the desicion I'm giving you my and many other womens point of view. I hope I was able to help.	Family & Relationships

I don't want this relationship to be ruined by taking things too fast, but I have an issue. My...erm...unit isn't straight when it's at a full salute. In fact, it leans about 20 degrees to the left. I noticed the scar from circumcision some time ago and can't help but wonder, is this normal? If it isn't...are there options to fix it when I turn 18? What options do I have? Thanks [SEP] best_answer: First off, Kudos to you for not being like every other a**hole guy and going straight into a girls pants!! Secondly,  Believe it or not, not very many guys have straight...uh... areas.  Though, it sounds like it could have been a result of too much skin being cut from your circumcision.  Im assuming its pretty normal considering you have probably had a physical with your doctor and the issue was never brought up before.  If your that uncomfortable about it, ask your doctor if there is anything you can do to change it.	Family & Relationships

He may just want something else, so you gotta really think if it's worth it. My boyfriend has been gone for 9 months and I'm still very much in love with him, and very faithful. I can't imagine losing him for some "crush"...I alwayz say if you want to cheat, you obviously don't want to be with the person you're with...cuz if you do, you wouldn't even think about cheating. Just tell that guy you have a boyfriend and you're not interested. if he keeps bothering you, don't hang around him anymore.	Family & Relationships
question_title: What was the craziest blind date you have ever had? [SEP] question_content: i've had one for the record books......i was just wondering if anyone else had strange experiences too. [SEP] best_answer: I have one for you.  I used to live in Columbus, Ohio, and I'd put an ad in a Single's Magazine.  There was one lady that replied that seemed relatively nice, so we agreed to meet at a restaurant one day.  When we met she was so nervous you could cut the tension with a knife.  I don't remember what we talked about or for how long we talked but after the date was over we never saw or heard from each other again.  She was relatively nice looking and had a pleasant personality, but no matter how hard I tried I could not get her to relax.  I  could honestly feel the tension so bad that I felt I was being pushed against a wall.  Definitely a very strange experience because I don't think I'd ever scared someone so bad in life as much as I think I scared this poor woman.  Oh well, I chaulked it up as one for experience.

[SEP] best_answer: girls - guys really dig alone time.  it's a time away from everyone where they can just do whatever they want around the house, build stuff, watch sports and just lounge.

Its give and take.  \nthis isnt to say we dont enjoy spending time with you ladies, cuz thats not it at all.  we just need to chill by ourselves now and again, thats all.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Please Help- Serious Spyware Problem? [SEP] question_content: Hi,\nI used to get spyware warnings on system tray but unable to download anti-spyware b/c PC restarts at a moment I try to download. I used system restore and was able to download an anti-spyware and it found 2 browser hijackers in the start up and cleans it but the virus reappears again and again and always restarts whenever I type or search words like spyware, browser hijacker, malware, removal, etc.\n\nPlease help. I’m in the middle of a job-project that my file might be damaged.\nMy PC is Intel Pentium 4, win XP sp2, 1.7 GHZ, 512MB ram.\n\nMany Thanks\nHenny [SEP] best_answer: Ur computer has been affected by multiple viruses....since u say that even after removal by the anti-spyware, the virus seems to reappear.before i tell u the reasons i'll tl u what u must do as there is no easy solution to this problem, since the contents of the original MBR(master boot record) is lost.  The only solution for the anti-virus program is to detect that there is a problem, and to over write the contents of the MBR with a valid MBR program, which the anti-virus program will have to carry with itself.  If your favorite anti-virus program is not that smart, consider replacing it with a better one, or just boot from a write-protected uninfected DOS 5.0 diskette, and execute the program FDISK with the option /MBR.  This will re-create the executable code in the MBR without modifying the partition table data.\n\nIn general, infection by multiple viruses of the same file or area is possible and vital areas of the original may be lost.  This can make it difficult or impossible for virus disinfection tools to be effective, and replacement of the lost file/area will be necessary.U must have proper back-up for the projects that are going on.If there are no back ups then i think u have to loose some stuff.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED\nThe first of these viruses that infects the computer will overwrite the Master Boot Record with its body and store the original MBR at a certain place on the disk.  So far, this is normal for a boot-record virus.  But if now the other virus infects the computer too, it will replace the MBR (which now contains the virus that has come first)with its own body, and store what it believes is the original MBR (but in fact is the body of the first virus) AT THE SAME PLACE on the harddisk, thus OVERWRITING the original MBR.  When this happens, the contents of the original MBR are lost.  Therefore the disk becomes non-bootable.\n\nWhen a virus removal program inspects such a hard disk, it will see the SECOND virus in the MBR and will try to remove it by overwriting it with the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR.  However, now this sector contains the body of the FIRST virus. therefore, the virus removal program will install the\nfirst virus in trying to remove the second.  In all probability it will not wipe out the sector where the (infected) MBR has been stored.\n\nWhen the program is run again, it will find the FIRST virus in the MBR.  By trying to remove it, the program will get the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR, and will move it over the current (infected) MBR.  Unfortunately, this sector still contains the body of the FIRST virus.  Therefore, the body of\nthis virus will be re-installed over the MBR ad infinitum.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is the differece between bpo and call centre jobs? [SEP] question_content: what is the difference between BPO and call centre jobs? [SEP] best_answer: BPO means Business Processes Outsourcing. It can involve outsourcing(getting work done by third party) of any activity of a business like accounting, customer service, payroll preparation, data mining and so on. \nA Call centre is a place where trained people take customer service calls/enquiries for a particular company. Now a call centre work can be done by the company itself (called captive call centre) or it can be outsourced from a specialised firm (then it is called BPO).\n\nSo, essentially Call Center is a type of BPO service.\nSecondly, in a call center job you have to answer customer calls, whereas in a BPO job you could be doing call center work or any other process also maybe just desk job like data processing.

question_title: when i try to install a second anti virus program, it cautions me to remove my other programs.  what gives? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is something I noticed with Norton but this is probably because they don't want the competition. Sometimes one antivirus will find things that the other can't but usually collisions don't occur. In theory they can't pickup the quarantine of the other as that defies the idea of quarantine: where a virus is isolated. I have 2 antiviruses working in the background and you find that one will pick it up before the other (For me this is OneCare from Microsoft). Why do you need two antiviruses anyway? One combined with a good firewall is safe enough protection.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how do i connect two computers in a home network? one is upstais and the other downstairs? [SEP] question_content: I have one computer downstairs and another one upstairs. The computer downstairs is connected to the internet via a DSL modem by USB. Both the computers have Ethernet and USB 2.0 ports. What I want to do is to connect the two computers in some way so that both computers will have internet access. The problem is that I don't want to connect them by the means of wireless. I perfer cable. What equipment should I buy? The distance between the two computers is about 50 feet. [SEP] best_answer: You need  a router. if you don't want a wireless router, then you can get a wired router and buy enough cat5 cable to run from the upstairs computer to the router downstairs. You will then connect your DSL modem to the router and both computers to the router. Go to your computer name settings from the properties of my computer and enter a workgroup name for both of them (the default is "workgroup" and will work fine also), not the domain setting. The router software should set up a dynamic host table to give both of the computers their own IP addy to communicate on so you can use automatically detect in the TCP/IP settings. the DSL modem will now recognize the DSL modem as the IP address for your home account, not that of the computer. If you want sharing permissions for files and folders then you will need to create profiles on each of the computers that give the necessary permissions for the other computers profile/sign on. \n\nThe cat5 cable itself will have to be physically run from the upstairs computer to the router so you will need to either get enough to tack it on the stairs and wall trim etc or drill through the floor/ceiling.\n\n\nGood Luck	Computers & Internet

question_title: how do i clean squirrels so i can eat them? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pretty easy, really.\nAfter you kill the squirrel, take your knife and cut a hole in the center of his back, crosswise of his body.  Make the hole about a inch wide.  Next, insert on finger from either hand into the opening, and pull just enough to make the hole large enough to get a better grip with more fingers.  Then just pull your hands apart.  The skin will usually tear around the squirrel, leaving it looking very much like a pair of pants and a shirt on the squirrel.  Pull off the top part first, the "shirt" pulling the skin up until his wrist and neck is free of skin.  Then break the wrist and cut loose below the freed skin.  Remove the head, and the skin from the "shirt" has the head and front feet in it.  Unless you plan on eating the brains, throw it away.  Personally, I'll leave squirrel brains and scrambled eggs to the old-timers!\nNext, hit the bottom half, the "pants"  Same basic procedure, but this time you're gonna have some intestines at the bottom, and if it was a male squirrel there's gonna be some more equipment down there...just yank it or cut it off.\nNow when you open it up, use just the tip of your knife. Put your finger on the backside of the blade, about a half inch or so from the point, so you don't bust any internal organs.  Horrible smell...avoid if possible.  Start at the pelvis and run the blade all the way up to the ribcage.  At this point, rupturing organs are no longer a concern, so go ahead and slice the ribcage open, sternum to throat.  Slide your fingers into the abdomen cavity, and pull out the internals.  Make sure you get all of it; it's not hard.  Next, remove the lungs and heart.  Make sure to get the windpipe.  Also, remember to bust the pelvis and make sure you get all the intestines and any droppings that may have squeezed out.  \nTake the squirrel inside, wash it with cold water, remove the legs and cut in half about halfway up the body.  Fill a fairly large bowl with saltwater, and put the dressed squirrel in it and put the whole thing in the refridgerator for at least a few hours, or overnight.  Then, pull the squirrel out, wash it, and either cook it, or freeze it.  \nI, personally, prefer mine fried, although squirrel dumplings are great, too...	Sports

question_title: Bernard Hopkins or Tarver?...who u think will win??? [SEP] question_content: i'm praying Hopkins can bow out with this win as one of greatest boxers in his weight class.... [SEP] best_answer: B-Hop is moving up to fight tarver, so either way i dont think many would say he wasnt one of the great fighters at 160. Probably one of the best things b hop has going for him is that tarver is coming down in weight from that foolish rocky movie (and a lot of guys cant really recover from cutting all the weight for one reason or another). Tarver is a pretty skilled boxer so hopkins edge against most fighters probably doesnt come into play as much here. I dont know how much he has left in the tank at this point, but i do hope he can beat tarver for one last hurrah. Still i think tarver wins by a close decision, since thats the way it seems their styles will dictate this fight. Either way hopkins is an all time great at 160.	Sports

question_title: What are the core beliefs of the political left and the political right? [SEP] question_content: What are they trying to achieve in the end? [SEP] best_answer: at the root of the political institutions of the left and right, there are simple human emotions.  Because of this, what those institutions eventually achieve or fail to achieve is ultimately beyond the reach of such institutions to predict, no matter how much the followers of a particular philosophy want it to be otherwise.  \n\nto sum up the emotions I'm referring to: If the status quo benefits someone, they tend to be conservative and on the right.  If the status quo doesn't particularly do any good for a person, they tend to be liberal and on the left.  \n\nthis is why students and young people tend to the left - they have no property or high social status to defend, no great steady job to hang onto.  But these same people, a few years later, often wouldn't be going to protests anymore, because they have a good job and a mortgage and car payments and whatnot.  Generally, as people age they become more conservative.   \n\nthe more status and property people have, the higher their priority is to protect what they've got.  So, the old dad who used to be a hippy, is a grumpy stick-in-the-mud by the time his kids are idealistic teens!\n\nthis dynamic all works on a large, collective scale as well.  It's all about what people have to lose.  The more they have to lose, the further right they drift...	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: i think, those people who say nasty things should first delve into details and be open minded enough..

To make themselves feel better they judge what other people say and do without ever really finding out about it.  Despite everything we know about the history of the world and all the technology at our fingertips too many people ignore all the information we have.

question_title: what were the issues in the 1976 presidential election between carter and ford? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would challenge the "not hotly contested" - Carter started off with a lead, but it did get closer towards the end of the race. He only won by about 3 percentage points and it was also fairly close electorally.\n\nAs to the issues themselves, Watergate kind of overshadowed every election in both 1974 and 1976. Carter presented himself as an outsider, someone untainted by Washington politics who would clean up the system.\nFord basically played the experience card, arguing that Carter lacked the experience to lead the country.\nThe other major issues were economics, especially inflation and Ford's inability to control it (look up WIN buttons).\nAnd Ford did make a major faux pas about the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe during one of the debares.

question_title: Do other countries have the right to use rendition to interrogate US civilians or military personnel? [SEP] question_content: Since the US president has first denied, then admitted and then justified the use of extraordinary rendition to snatch individuals out of foreign countries and send them where they can be tortured for information, should other countries be allowed to do the same thing to US citizens and gov't employees? Many other countries consider our actions to be terrorist in nature (not saying I agree, but I am aware of their assertions). [SEP] best_answer: You know, I am never shocked at what one human will do to another, even without just cause.  Torture is in my book an effective means of gaining information, but completely inhumane. Any national of any country technically is forbidden to engage in torture during wartime; as far as I understand the Geneva Convetions. But who is actually going to refrain when they believe their cause for doing so is justified? As for the question of should anyone have the right to engage in torture, I'd have to say level the playing field and let a war be a war again, stop trying to civilize the most uncivilized act possible!

question_title: Even when a report PROVES the existence of WMD's in Iraq the LIBS still don't get it. Why? [SEP] question_content: The report released today proves that the former government of Iraq lied to weapons inspectors and to the UN Security Council and has stockpiles of WMD's stashed randomly around the country and yet even after all of this is proven the libs here and on TV are STILL coming up with excuses. Why can't they just admit they were wrong, or better yet just admit that they're anti-war hippies?\n\nAnd, more importantly, why do the libs always pretend that WMD's were the only reason given for a war in the middle east? [SEP] best_answer: That's easy.  Back when we were all discussing why Saddam needed his ass kicked, the libs kneejerked their way into a corner.  They hate(d) Bush SOOOO bad, they couldn't allow themselves to be seen agreeing with him, so the importance of the WMDs had to be minimized.  Now, any time a report comes out that demonstrates Iraq had WMD's, the lib press and politicians will talk about anything BUT that report.\n\nThe libs aren't completely stupid (ok, they are, but that's another topic) and they realize that to admit they were wrong will not only remove their mainstream base, but they will also loose face with the extreme lefties.  Not a good thing with elections coming up, so all they have left to do is scream about bringing the troops home, blah blah blah to divert attention from the real issues.	Politics & Government
question_title: If the king or queen commits a crime, how will he/she be tried in court? What will be the case's title? [SEP] question_content: Has a king or queen committed a crime and tried before a court in history? I know many monarchs have gotten away with their heinous crimes, while the unlucky ones had their citizens revolt against them, but have any actually been taken to court before? What will be the case's title? After all, the state is prosecuting the monarch him/herself. Rex v. Rex? Regina v. Regina? What about if the king or queen takes their respective spouse to court? Rex v. Regina? Regina v. Rex? [SEP] best_answer: In the United Kingdom the sovereign not only has immunity from prosecution, it has become accepted that he or she cannot be required to give evidence in court. \n\nIt is true that Charles I was tried for treason before a Parliamentary court, convicted and executed. However, it should be noted that after the Restoration in 1660 the men who had tried the king were arrested. Several of them were then hung, drawn and quartered and, with a few exceptions, the rest were imprisoned for life.	Politics & Government

We were "to;d" (No signed contract) that it was first and last with any stipulations 110 yrs ago that it would go up with rent increases. Can they demand more than original "last months'" rent? [SEP] best_answer: If not in writing it's going to be tough to fight it. Unless it was specifically addressed in your verbal agreement they have every legal right to ask for additional deposit.

And joining the Military(not sure which branch yet) is one of my options. Its not the money or college opportunites that I like about the Military,( I have enough money to go to about any college) mostly its prestige. So anyways my question is basically what were your experinces during training, how tough is it really and any info you can give me on it.  Also which branch would you recommend, and will a GED cut it? [SEP] best_answer: The training in ANY branch is absolutely "no harder than it needs to be".  You'll notice that I put that in quotes.  The saying is old, but it's true.  The idea behind the training is to keep you alive in a combat situation.  Is it hard?  Yes.  Is it too hard?  Depends on how much you value your life, honestly.  The USAF training is not too hard, because they are not on the ground.  USN focuses on swimming and staying alive in water (go figure).  The Army and Marines training is harder (USMC is harder and longer), because they are on the ground and doing the dirty.\n\nWhich branch would I recommend?  The branch that offers YOU the best deal for YOU!  I spent 20 years in the Army, and was a recruiter.  I know that the Army has the best deal out there, but it's YOUR life, YOUR decision.  You need to sit down with each branch, get your information, and make your decision after reviewing ALL the material.\n\nGED?  That's a timing issue.  If you have some college, that will help.  If you can score over 50 on the ASVAB, that will help.  That's another issue that needs to be brought up with the recruiting offices. \n\nGood luck	Politics & Government

question_title: There IS something faster than the speed of light, and no,? [SEP] question_content: its not the Starship Enterprise or a pickpocket on the NYC\nsubway system, it's called Cerenkov radiation. How many of you out there can REALLY delineate this, and what the\nimplications of this are? [SEP] best_answer: Cherenkov radiation results from particles traveling faster than the speed of light _in a medium_. The particles are still not traveling faster than THE speed of light, which is more fully described as the speed of light in a vaccuum. Thus, the only implications of this is that the water tanks around nuclear reactors glow blue (which, if you haven't seen it, is really freaking cool).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is sun? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Our SUN is a normal main-sequence G2 star, one of more than 100 billion stars in our galaxy. \n\n        diameter:    1,390,000 km.\n        mass:        1.989e30 kg\n        temperature: 5800 K (surface)\n                     15,600,000 K (core)\n\nThe SUN is by far the largest object in the solar system. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest). \n\nIt is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. That's true in the sense that there are many others similar to it. But there are many more smaller stars than larger ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. The median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less than half the mass of the Sun. \n\nThe Sun is personified in many mythologies: the Greeks called it Helios and the Romans called it Sol. \n\nThe Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else ("metals") amounts to less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core. \n\nThe outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles it's as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun is not a solid body like the Earth. Similar effects are seen in the gas planets. The differential rotation extends considerably down into the interior of the Sun but the core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.\n\nThere are nine planets and a large number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun. (Exactly which bodies should be classified as planets and which as "smaller objects" has been the source of some controversy, but in the end it is really only a matter of definition.) \n\n          Distance  Radius  Mass\nPlanet    (000 km)   (km)   (kg)   Discoverer   Date\n-------- --------  ------  -------  ----------  -----\nMercury     57,910    2439  3.30e23\nVenus      108,200    6052  4.87e24\nEarth      149,600    6378  5.98e24\nMars       227,940    3397  6.42e23\nJupiter    778,330   71492  1.90e27\nSaturn   1,426,940   60268  5.69e26\nUranus   2,870,990   25559  8.69e25   Herschel    1781\nNeptune  4,497,070   24764  1.02e26   Galle       1846\nPluto    5,913,520    1160  1.31e22   Tombaugh    1930	Science & Mathematics

question_title: If time is the measurement of change...? [SEP] question_content: Can someone tell me what exactly is changing? I mean, is the change thats being measured simply entropy? And if thats the case couldnt you say that time is the measurement of entropy or does that leave out some other change that Im not aware of? [SEP] best_answer: With advances in relativity, quantum mechanics and microscopy, time is actually currently defined as measuring the number of vibrations of a cesium atom.\n\nSince this motion slows down as you approach the speed of light, it could be said that we are measuring how much matter/energy has slowed down from the speed of light since the big bang...\n\nSince entropy is defined as, "the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work," measuring how long it has been since the big bang is not QUITE the same as measuring the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work.\n\nFor example, entropy itself has changes as our technology has progressed - we are now able to utilize a larger percentage of wind and solar energy than ever before in history, which necessarily means that the rate that entropy is increasing has slowed.  There is no reason to believe this will not be the case in other areas, such as nuclear fusion (which powers stars) or even tapping the vast vaccuum energy that is omniprescent throughout space.\n\n:)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is current? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Current is defined as the movement of charge  -- which can either be from the movement of electrons, or the movement of ions in solution.  For metals (and circuits), current is produced when electrons move through the metal.  In water, you can have ions (like Na+ and Cl-) which move in the solution.  The key point is that charge has to MOVE for you to have current.  \n\nFrom a Physics point of view, if the amount of charge is 'Q', then current is defined as 'i = dQ/dt'  where 'i' is current, and dQ/dT denotes the "change in current as a funtion of a change in time."

question_title: God is a Spirit? [SEP] question_content: We're all familiar with the Bible verse which says "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worhsip him in spirit and in truth."\n\n But, in Genesis I've found something a bit different.\nGenesis 18:1-4\nAnd the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre; and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day.\nAnd he lift up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him\nand when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and\nbowed himself before the ground\nand said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass\nnot away I pray thee from thy servant.\nLet a little water, I pray you, be fetched and wash your feet and\nrest yourseleves under tree.\n\nIt seems that not only did Abraham SEE God here, but he also thought\nhe was physical enough for his feet to be washed with water.\n\nAnd...in the first verse I mentioned it says God is a Spirit, with a capital S.  Doesn't that mean the Holy Ghost is God?  \n\nSo God is physical yes? [SEP] best_answer: A person needs to read this passage very carefully, and it really helps to read it in the Hebrew. The three men are never actually identified as God. A number of Jewish rabbis have noticed the same thing. It is *first* said that Abraham was sitting in his tent and had a vision of God, *then* he opened his eyes and saw three men. While Moses's narative style sometimes has an overview of events, and then more details, it's hard to say if that's what's happening here or not. In fact, it's almost funny to read if you take the stance that these three were angels in the last half of Genesis, because it has Abraham speaking to the angel that remained behind, and calling him "Adoni" (Lord) but never YHVH. But the one to reply is always YHVY and never Adoni. Also, in Genesis 18:22, it says that the men Abraham was speaking with turned and left, but Abraham stayed and pleaded with the LORD.\n\nBut even if you take the stance that one, or even all three, of these "angels" were in fact God Almighty, there is nothing to keep God Almighty as a spirit from creating a body and animating it himself. St. Augustine gets into that kind of an idea  little bit in one of his 15 books on the Trinity, I don't remember which off the top of my head.	Society & Culture
question_title: What do Christians and non-christians think of Michael and Debbie Pearl?

This seems unfair.\n\nThe 'pipe' that the Pearl's recommend is soft, flexible plastic water tubing a little over 1/4" wide- almost the kind of tubing you use for aquariums and such- the article makes it sound like lead pipe or PVC plumbing pipe.\n\nI agree with some of the basics at their site, but overall, I am not a fan of the couple or the site. They seem to me to be fanatics in a bad sense of the word.\n\nOddly, it IS NOT their views on spanking or using what amounts to an updated version ofthe willow switch that bugs me the most- it is the commercialism, herbs, and ultra-conservative fundamentalist world-view.\n\nI believe that MILDLY painful stimuli is a powerful learning tool. You see it in real life all the time, and I think it has a role, properly applied, in child-raising. (I never used a switch (or other tool), and never had to do more than a single 'smack' with my 4 kids. Spanking should not be the only or primary tool in your child-rearing toolkit!)\n\nI am horrified at the couple in the article that put such faith in ANY human, then misapply the guy's teachings so grotesquely that death occured. This couple needs psychiatric attention- or if they are mentally OK, needs to be punished for their acts.\n\nThis seems like the blind leading the blind.	Society & Culture

This life is the qualifying round for the upcoming life, the life after death, the eternal life.  If you see auto racing you will be knowing what and how important is the qualifying round.  This life will decide your status and level in the coming life.  Both the qualifying round and the final round are real.	Society & Culture

question_title: How and When does a boy become valued as a man by women (Not the legal 18)? [SEP] question_content: I am 24, have 2 jobs - 1 with health benefits, a virgin, have not been living with my parents for 3 years now, not a veteran, not a college graduate, not in the 25 percent tax bracket, and religiously undecided? [SEP] best_answer: Well, I beleive all woman have different veiws of a "Man" and what they should be made of.  I was raised to beleive that a man works hard to support his family and is head of his house hold but knows how to run the house hold not just by demanding respect but by giving it also.  You seem to be off to a pretty good start with being able to work hard to support yourself and possibly someone else you decide to be with.  Women like the idea of stability. . . if you can show a woman that you have this in your life now and that is just as important to you, then she will allow herself to trust you as a man instead of looking at you as someone she will have to work on and "Train" as some of us put it.  Have your own life in order and in such an order that bringing someone else into it will be a smooth transition.  It's about being prepared and letting the woman know that you are capable of handling things.  We all want to feel safe in our lives and it is your job as a MAN to fill that need.  Other wise we spend the rest of our lives running home to daddy because he is the one MAN in our life that we trust and feel safe with.  When you are ready to take on these roles woman will veiw you as a man.\n\nI hope that these few words will help you out.  Good Luck on your path to manhood!!	Society & Culture
question_title: I'm protestant - If I married a Catholic...? [SEP] question_content: -Would our kids have to be Catholic?\n-Would we have to go to "Catholic" pre-marital counseling?\n-What type of ceremony could we have?\n-Has anyone else dealt with the same scenario? (If so, how did you handle it?) [SEP] best_answer: If you want to get married in a catholic church, you will be given all kinds of "conditions" and have to jump through all kinds of hoops to satisfy the priest.  Even after you jump through all the hoops, he might refuse to let you actually walk up the aisle, you might have to stand at the back of the church and get married there.  And the priest also might look and see how much your fiance has donated, and if it is not enough, he might still might not do the ceremony until your fiance satisfies his greed.\n\nUpdate to david_in_mil...:  My brother was one of the people I know that went through it.  He and his wife did all the nonsense the priest demanded, then he told them he would not marry them because he looked at the ledger, and saw no donations from him or his wife.  When they explained that she did not like using envelopes and simply put the money in the collection basket, he said she had no proof, and until they met his price, no wedding.  They went to an Episcopal church and were married there - no nonsense, no problems.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why was the Union fighting at Gettysburg? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the Battle of Gettysburg was never supposed to happen.  It was a battle that accidentally occurred when branches of each army ran into each other.\n\nMore here:\n\nThe greatest battle of the Civil War almost wasn't.  It was not a planned attack; rather the Confederate General Lee had his troops on the move trying to threaten other northern cities.  However, Confederate and Union troops came together at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for three days of the most intense fighting to occur during our country's Civil War.\n\n     The geology of the area around Gettysburg was an important factor of the three days of battle.  A number of ridges that play key roles in the fighting run mostly north and south.  These ridges are diabase sills.   The area is made up of the Piedmont proper, the Triassic basins, the Blue Ridge of Virginia, and the Great Valley.\n\nhttp://www.scsc.k12.ar.us/2000backeast/Trip/Members/CopleyJ/	Society & Culture
question_title: Realization about Islam and a few questions.? [SEP] question_content: The people doing horrid things in the name of Islam are not Musslim.  Or "true" Musslims.  I was reading some information supplied by ahmed_mo2nis (Thanks)and came to this conclusion.\n\nThe Questions...\nWhy are the religious leaders fueling these acts of violence instead of telling these people they are wrong?\n\nHow have so many people been led into such a wrong understanding of their own faith?\n\nSide Notes...\nMost religions are used to fuel personal agendas.\nPeople have to police their own or they will be guilty by asociation. [SEP] best_answer: The Islamic clerics that are against the violence are afraid of the repercussions of their "radical stance". \n\nIt's kind of like Yasser Arafat turning down the Israeli's offer of giving him %99 of the demands that he had put out. Even if he had accepted the offer and tried to make peace with Israel, someone in Hamas or Mujahedin would have assasinated him.	Society & Culture

question_title: Christian vegetarians? [SEP] question_content: Are there many of you?

I don't believe God really cares about you being a vegetarian. As for the dominion we have it without slaughtering animals. Adam and Eve never ate meat in the garden of eden only afterwards did God say that you could. So having dominion is control of them(Which we still do).	Society & Culture

question_title: Will Harriet Tubman go to Hell for being deceitful? [SEP] question_content: In case you don't know who she is remember the undergroud railroad. [SEP] best_answer: Harriet was a Christian believer. She honored God above any established law of the government. Just as the Apostles did in their day. \n\nRead this article:\n\nHarriet Tubman\nThe "Moses" of Her People\n\n\n"I always tole God, 'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nIn 1831 a Kentucky slave named Tice Davids made a break for the free state of Ohio by swimming across the Ohio River. His master trailed close behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, Davids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky in a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids "must have gone off on an underground road." The name stuck, and the legend of the underground railroad was born.\n\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a part of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic exploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated "conductor."\n\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland but escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said later, "I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was free. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold through de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven."\n\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 return trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow slaves, boasting "I never lost a passenger." Her guidance of so many to freedom earned her the nickname "Moses."\n\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of her strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of the weak. "I always tole God," she said, "'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her capture, she was never apprehended. "I can't die but once" became her motto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of deliverance.\n\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually going into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to whom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. Slaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be missed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often be late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them missing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired by Tubman would take down.\n\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded strict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his master would likely be forced to reveal information that would compromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a rescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to reconsider.\n\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she replied, "Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough to betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let so many die just for one coward man?"\n\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close with one: "I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. They'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped right up and went on as well as anybody."\n\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led slaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading her. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, "I never met any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God."\n\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and their sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as "one of the best and bravest 	Society & Culture
