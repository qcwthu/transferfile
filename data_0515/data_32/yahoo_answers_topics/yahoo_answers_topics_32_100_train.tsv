question_title: what is a conjugated bridge? [SEP] question_content: part of the body [SEP] best_answer: A hfr cell (also called hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (often F) integrated into its genomic DNA. Hfr is the abbreviation for high frequency recombination, which was first characterized by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. Unlike a normal F+ cell, hfr strains will, upon conjugation with a F- cell, attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridges (called pili) to the F- cell. This occurs because the F factor has integrated itself via an insertion point in the bacterial chromosome. Due to the F factor's inherent nature to transfer itself over the pilus during bacteria conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it, thus making such cells very useful and interesting in terms of studying gene linkage and recombination.\n\nA structure as fragile as a mating bridge will, however, likely break, and so the transfer is rarely complete. Thus, the F- cell uses only part of the genomic DNA of the Hfr cell for recombination. Though there is some debate on the issue, the pili themselves do not seem to be the structures through which the actual exchange of DNA takes place; rather, some proteins seem to open a channel between the bacteria.\n\nIt should also be noted that the bacterial genome's rate of transfer through the pilus is constant; this allows molecular biologists and geneticists to use Hfr strain of bacteria (often E. Coli) to study genetic linkage and map the chromosome. The procedure commonly used for this is called interrupted mating.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Math equation!!!? [SEP] question_content: Solve this....\n\ng over 5-7 = -27......how do u do this??? [SEP] best_answer: g/(5 - 7) = -27 \nThe approach is to move the numbers to one side of the equation and the g's to the other [although you have only one 'g']\n\nYou can add/subtract/multiply/divide the same thing from both sides of an equation.\n\nSo, lets multiply both sides by (5 - 7):\n(g/(5 - 7) )* (5 - 7) = -27 * (5 - 7)\nthen,\ng = -27 * (-2)\ng = +54 [since multiplying two minuses makes a plus]\n\nHope this helps!

question_title: if an anchor is dropped from a boat into a lake, will the water level of the lake rise or fall? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say the anchor weighs 15 pounds in air and displaces 2 pounds of water.\nBefore the drop, the boat displaces its weight plus the 15 lb weight in air of the anchor. This is the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor hits bottom, the boat displaces its weight only and the anchor displaces 2 lb of water, the minimum displacement situation, so the water is at minimum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor doesn't reach the bottom, the boat displaces its weight plus the 13 lb weight in water of the anchor. The anchor displaces 2 lb water. The total displacement is the same as the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Leonid meteor shower....... Anyone in Santa Barbara, CA??? [SEP] question_content: what would be the place to see it from, what time? which way do i look?? i don't want to miss it this year so just wondering if anyone can tell me where to look and stuff... [SEP] best_answer: Anyplace not cloudy and that does not have too many bright lights will do. Just look anywhere in the sky. The meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Look after midnight though, because the radiant won't rise until then. The later at night you look, the better. 4:00 AM would be the best time to look.\n\nThe predictions are not that good this year. A few years ago I saw 50 bright ones per hour. This year they are predicting 10 or 15 per hour, and maybe not bright ones either. Also, the peak time is before the radiant rises in the US, so Europe will see the best show. If the predictions are correct.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: can we trap light after the source of which is turned off so that we can open the trap and see the light in it [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say you shine a flashlight into a mirror. Then put a mirror behind the flashlight and remove the flashlight. Given that the 2 mirrors are exactly parallel, will the light just bounce back and forth forever? No - the light travels in waves and each time it reflects back, some of the light is not hitting the mirror exactly at 90 degrees and is reflected off on an angle. The light will reflect away and eventually dissipate completely. \nIf you try to trap light in a box, as it bounces off the walls inside, it will dissipate into energy (heat). The temperature of the inside of the box will raise - but just infintestimly so.\nRemember all of this will take place at the speed of light.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes the movement of wind? [SEP] question_content: And what causes it to come to an end? [SEP] best_answer: Wind is the roughly horizontal movement of air (as opposed to an air current) caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It occurs at all scales, from local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting tens of minutes to global winds resulting from solar heating of the Earth. The two major influences on the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect).\n\nGiven a difference in barometric pressure between two air masses, a wind will arise between the two which tends to flow from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure until the two air masses are at the same pressure, although these flows will be modified by the Coriolis effect in the extratropics.\n\nWinds can be classified either by their scale, the kinds of forces which cause them (according to the atmospheric equations of motion), or the geographic regions in which they exist. There are global winds, such as the wind belts which exist between the atmospheric circulation cells. There are upper-level winds, such as the jet streams. There are synoptic-scale winds that result from pressure differences in surface air masses in the middle latitudes, and there are winds that come about as a consequence of geographic features such as the sea breeze. Mesoscale winds are those which act on a local scale, such as gust fronts. At the smallest scale are the microscale winds which blow on a scale of only tens to hundreds of metres and are essentially unpredictable, such as dust devils and microbursts.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below...

question_title: How does battery-charging without physical contact work? [SEP] question_content: I thought that you need a physical contact between the charger and the battery so the electricity actually arrives inside the battery.\nNow my new electrical toothbrush seems to work differently. It has a battery, the manual confirms. It also has a charger. But all I need to do is to put the toothbrush on the charger.\n\nHow does that work? Both parts are plastic covered. [SEP] best_answer: Its using induction charge principle. Essentially the primary coil side of the transformer is built into the base and the secondary coil is built into the toothbrush. \n\nThe primary winding of the inductive charger transmits charging power to the secondary winding, inside the target device, without making direct electrical or mechanical contact with it. In the target device, power is received with a coil and then rectified by a diode. This DC voltage is used in charging the battery of the device.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is big bang? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In physical cosmology, the Big Bang is the scientific theory that the universe emerged from an enormously dense and hot state about 13.7 billion years ago. The Big Bang theory is based on the observed Hubble's law redshift of distant galaxies that when taken together with the cosmological principle indicate that space is expanding according to the Friedmann-Lemaître model of general relativity. Extrapolated into the past, these observations show that the universe has expanded from a state in which all the matter and energy in the universe was at an immense temperature and density. Physicists do not widely agree on what happened before this, although general relativity predicts a gravitational singularity (for reporting on some of the more notable speculation on this issue, see cosmogony).\n\nThe term Big Bang is used both in a narrow sense to refer to a point in time when the observed expansion of the universe (Hubble's law) began — calculated to be 13.7 billion (1.37 × 1010) years ago (±2%) — and in a more general sense to refer to the prevailing cosmological paradigm explaining the origin and expansion of the universe, as well as the composition of primordial matter through nucleosynthesis as predicted by the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory [1].\n\nOne consequence of the Big Bang is that the conditions of today's universe are different from the conditions in the past or in the future (natural evolution of universe constantly takes place). From this model, George Gamow in 1948 was able to predict, at least qualitatively, the existence of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) [2]. The CMB was discovered in the 1960s and further validated the Big Bang theory over its chief rival, the steady state theory.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: plz help me i am in desperate need of advice? [SEP] question_content: so junior prom is coming up right, and there's boy that i liked. my cousin had asked him if he wanted to take me to prom he said yes and we both agreed that we would go as friends. then the same night that my cousin asked him, we were hanging out in our development, and all of a sudden he just kisses me, tounge and everything, then he tells me that even though i did that, i am not looking for a relationship, i said neither am i. so two days after this happened, he haventh said a word to me and he seem to be ignoring me. what do you think happened? and to add he is white and i am black and we live in pennsylvania [SEP] best_answer: Two possibilities: \n- he wants to have the benefits but not the responsibility. Perhaps he was just letting you know how he'd like your friendship to be. You know, fooling around but not committing.\n- in reality, he wants to have a relationship with you, but is afraid to ask or is afraid that you would not be down with it. So by saying he doesn't want to committ, he was testing the waters to see how you thought about this. \n\nMy personal guess is that the first option is more like it. He's a guy, and guys like to think of themselves as players. Unless you have no problem with being casual friends with benefits, then no prob. But if it disturbs you that he wants the goods but not you, then you're better off with someone who wants the whole package.\n\nIn any case, make sure he still wants to go to prom with you. He sounds a bit like a jerk (sorry, but he's ignoring you!). Make sure that YOU have a date!	Family & Relationships

Any help please??? [SEP] best_answer: Whether or not you decide to tell him, he did you a favor by asking you this question. Every person should ask themselves this. You should keep asking yourself this, as often as it takes, until you are completely confident in the answer for yourself. This is what it takes to take control of your life, to make yourself into the person you want to be. \n\nDon't be afraid to have high expectations, as long as your resolve and commitment to your dreams are strong.

Best to say you are giving it serious thought and will get back to them.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: well i know how you feel, and it is already hard work to stay friends with someone when you live a long ways away, so if you dont get along very well anymore maybe it is time to let your friendship just drift appart this might be easier than trying to be friends with someone who doesnt or isnt willing to understand you.

question_title: my ex and I are trying to be friends... good idea? [SEP] question_content: So my ex and I have never been too great of friends, even before we were dating. But this year, the tension between us seemed to pull our group of friends apart, so we decided to try to be friends.\nThe problem is, he seems to expect me to put in all the effort to be nice and friendly, only responding once i've made the first move.\nWe have our ups and downs, but i can't take it anymore. So now, i've made it clear that i'm not going to try so hard unless he decides to be a man and put in some effort. \nShould I:\n(1) wait for him to come around,\n(2) go back to putting in all the effort,\n(3) just give up on him?? [SEP] best_answer: option 3. he wasn't much of a friend before, and now that you have relationship baggage and nothing strong platonically to bind you from before, there is no friendship to revive here. too much complication and effort on your part. let him go and make different friends, see different guys, be free!!

question_title: I am married to a truck driver who, even whrn he's home I'd consider myself alone.? [SEP] question_content: I left him for @3 weeks and he was wonderful while we were apart. We had long conversations and made love 3 times in a week, where as it had been almost a year since the last time. I feel like he's really not interested in me. Not emotionally, sexually nothing.... I don't want to leave him but I'm not getting any younger. I'm 46 now and I want some romance and love in my life, and yes, sex would be nice also. Someone please talk to me. He wont and I just don't know what to do anymore. [SEP] best_answer: If you're miserable in your marriage and you have tried unsuccessfully to work things out with your husband then there is only one thing you can do--SHOW HIM THE DOOR.  Trust me...I was in a dead-end marriage and was totally miserable.  The only reason I stayed in the marriage as long as I did was for the kids. But now I look back at it and realize that I should have left him long before we even got married, because there were signs there that things weren't going to be right.\n\nSo many times us women think if we just stick things out things will change, or even we can change the man.  But sadly that doesn't happen, and for you to stay in a marriage\nwhere you feel alone is only going to hurt you.  Life is short--you deserve to be happy and feel loved and like you have a partner in your relationship.\n\nRegarding your previous split with your husband, it sounds like he was almost over-doing it in fear of losing you.  It shouldn't take the fear of losing you to make him treat you like his wife.  Cut him loose, and when he comes a wooing tell him "Sorry, you had your chance."  Then get out there and find you a good man.  You'll be glad you did.	Family & Relationships

If so your dependent would be listed on your orders.\n\nIf not, a birth certficate should list you as the parent.  If the father was also on the birth certificate you may have more of a problem.  If you have not been to court to establish custody, they may view you as kidnapping your child.  \n\nWould need more detail to say for sure but if the father is on the Birth Certificate you may have to file court documents for custody or maybe a notarized letter may work???  Check with the US Embassy in Kuwait.\n\nAs for a document saying you've never been married, not sure there is such a thing.  Just because you have not been married in one state does not mean you weren't marrried in another.  You would need proof from all 50 states saying you haven't been married???	Family & Relationships

question_title: what to do about this situation......? [SEP] question_content: ever since my bf moved away to start his business, he has changed, we went to talking on the phone 5-6 times a day now down to 1-2. if i call him sometimes he would say "bay i'll call you right back, but sometimes he forgets to call me back for the rest of the night. he used to stay on the phone with me while i drive home from work, but now he just says text me when you get home, or he'll say call when you get home, and i call but no answer. he has changed alot, when we were together here everything was great, but now i have alot of doubts, how can i move down there when he is acting like this, i am very unsure about him. can anyone help me to figure him out? because it's about to be over...... [SEP] best_answer: Hey! I understand how you must be feeling. It is better to talk to him openly with out pushing him at all. While talking to him make sure that you are giving him enough space to answer your questions. Dont ask him any close ended questions. Ask him only open end questions. I feel he must be very busy with his bussiness since it is new, he needs to pay more attension to his bussiness to grow. Generally boys are very less in talking and showing feelings. it doesnt mean that they are not sensitive. So dont jump in to conclusion and be open to him and dont try to control him or try not to doubt him too. give him time. I wish you good luck. God be with you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Is this common for North american girls? [SEP] question_content: My girl friend is Canadian, and her father abandoned her when she was very young. She always hangs out with other male friends, and it really bothers me a lot. I told her to stop doing it. But she keeps telling me that I should trust her, and sometimes she even calls me sexist. I really like her, but I can't stand this anymore. Do you think her acting this way is somewhat related to her father that abandoned her? or is this just very typical thing to do for North american girls? Are you girls hang out with other guys a lot when you actually have boyfriends too? [SEP] best_answer: I guess she feels good that way. Isn't it so? And you like her?\nThen you should enjoy that she feels good. Or don't you ?\nSo, I see you do not like her so much. That's it. \nGot it ?	Family & Relationships

question_title: White minority? [SEP] question_content: Is it possible for a white person to be considered a minority? lets say a white person lives in an all black neighborhood (like the south side of chicago) and they never see anyone else but black people. would they be considered a minority? Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this? [SEP] best_answer: Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called "whitey" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life.	Society & Culture

question_title: man date women but has serious secret interest exclusively in men who are women from waist up? [SEP] question_content: and who wear make-up etc - is he really interested in men, and too afraid to come out of the closet or what? [SEP] best_answer: That is a tricky question.  But I have met people who have interests in crossdressers, transexuals, and women, but not in men.\n\nIt seems that in these situations, the men have a great attraction to women, but also have an attraction to the penis.  However, they feel no attraction to average men.  In this case, the person has to find people who are similar enough to women to clearly not be men, but who also have a penis.	Society & Culture

Never, never, never!"  :-))\n\nBut That Which Is always...IS. Throughout the day, my heart rises spontaneously in thanksgiving and gratitude, for my luck (Oh! No, no, no! That is ANOTHER question!)  :-)) For what I have been given, for all that I have, for the very good people who love me, for the incredible, sustaining beauty of the natural world.\n\nSometimes I am not sure to Whom I am praying, but my heart rises, anyway!\n\nThe only serious (the save-my-butt stuff isn't really serious, in my opinion) prayers I say are to ask for knowledge of God's will, and the power to carry it out.\n\nSometimes I toss in a request for strength, and understanding.

They were just shacking up and had alot of illegitimate kids...but seriously...read the following article.\n\nThe following is an Article published six or seven years ago in Green Egg.\n\n*We Are the Other People*\n\nby Oberon (Otter) Zell\n\n"Ding-dong!" goes the doorbell. Is it Avon calling? Or perhaps Ed McMahon with my three million dollars? No, it's Yahweh's Witlesses again, just wanting to have a nice little chat about the Bible... Boy, did they ever come to the wrong house! So we invite them in: "Enter freely and of your own will..." (Hey, it's Sunday morning, nothing much going on, why not have a little entertainment?) Diane and I amuse ourselves watching their expressions as they check out the living room: great horned owl on the back of my chair; ceremonial masks and medicine skulls of dragons and unicorns on the wall; crystals, wands, staffs, swords; lots of Goddess figures and several altars; boa constrictors draped in amorous embrace over the elkhorn; white doves sitting in the hanging planters; cats and weasels underfoot; iron dragon snorting steam atop the wood stove; posters and paintings of wizards and dinosaurs and witchy women, some proudly naked; sculptures of mythological beasties and lots more dinosaurs; warp six on the star-filled viewscreen of my computer; a five-foot model of the USS Enterprise and the skeleton of a plesiosaur hanging from the ceiling; very, very many books, most of them dealing with obviously weird subjects... To say nothing of the great horned owl perched on the back of my chair and the Unicorn grazing in the front yard. You know; early Addams Family decor. And then, of course, it being late in the morning, you can expect Morning Glory to come wandering out naked, looking for her wake-up cup of tea. Morning Glory naked is a truly impressive sight, and the Witlesses look as if she'd set titties on stun as they stand immobilised, hands clasped over their genitals. With the stage set and all the actors in place, the show is ready to begin.\n\nTheir mission, of course, is to save our heathen souls by turning us on to "The Word of the Lord"- their Bible. I guess they figure some of us just haven't heard about it yet, and we're all eagerly awaiting their joyous tidings of personal salvation through giving our rational faculties to Jesus. Every time they come around, I look forward to trying out a new riposte. Sure, it may be cruel and sadistic of me, but hey, I didn't call them up and ask them to come over; they entered at their own risk! This time should be pretty good. After letting them run off their basic rap while lovely Morning Glory serves us all hot herb tea, I innocently remark: "But none of that applies to us. We have no need for salvation because we don't have original sin. We are the Other People."\n\n"Hunh? What?" they reply eloquently. It's clear they've never heard this one before. "\n\nRight," I say. "It's all in your Bible." And I proceed to tell them the story, using their own book for reference: (Genesis 1:26) The [Elohim] said, "Let us make humanity in our own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth." Elohim is a plural word, including male and female, and should properly be translated "Gods" or "Pantheon." (1: 27) The Gods created humanity in the image of themselves, In the image of the Gods they created them, Male and female they created them. (1:28) The Gods blessed them, saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven and all living animals on the earth."\n\nNow clearly, here we are talking about the original creation of the human species: male and female. All the animals, plants, etc. hav	Society & Culture

So much more logical than NOTHING created SOMETHING.  I don't have enough faith to be an athiest. [SEP] best_answer: Great question. I am an atheist, but have never said there is "no evidence of god" there is just not enough proof for me. Also, say god is real. Then he must of just been there, so why couldn't the world?!

question_title: What is Mardi gras celebration about?  What to do on mardi gras day? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Party, party, party!!!  It is a pagan holliday where people get very drunk and act like wild animals.  It is also called Fat Tuesday.  It is the Tuesday just before Lent or Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holliday where people promise to give up something they really enjoy for 40 days till Easter.  It is most popularly celebrated in New Orleans.  There is a carnival atmosphere where people get very intoxicated in the streets of New Orleans.  Guys buy beaded necklaces and give them to girls for flashing their breasts.  \n\nFor me as a Christian, I think it is kinda sad.  I look forward to celebrating Easter as the time when Christ died for me and rose again.  I think that a devout Catholic should be ashamed of themself if they were to go out and act like this, then go to confession, followed by Ash Wednesday where they make a "sacrifice" to show how much they love Him.

question_title: Are most Atheists introverts or extroverts? [SEP] question_content: Extroverts are more people-oreintated, need company of other people to feel good and thrive on rapid communications and large crowds.  Being isolated for too long drains their energy.\n\nIntroverts are opposite, they thrive on being alone with themselves and usually are very deep thinkers.  They think everything through before saying or acting on anything.   Introverts are not anti-social, but being around people for too long drains them.\n\nI am an introvert.  I am curious to see if atheists are more one or the other? [SEP] best_answer: I'm an introvert, I don't rely on approval from others and I don't like being with people who drain me, especially people who don't put any effort into being interesting or entertaining and behave like sponges.\n\nI can enjoy being quite social and extroverted in a big way for short periods but I need my down time alone to think...I'm mostly very serious and even when I ask silly questions here it's because usually they are associated to something of deeper significance...though I do throw in a red herring just for fun every so often to annoy certain people or wind them up.

Was the divine personification of the primordial waters of chaos.\n2. Was the godess of war.\n(The first one is a god)\nHere is your choices for the first one. Aker, Amun, Kuk, Atum, Baba, or Nun.\nHere is your choices for the second one. Anat, Hathor, Isis, Neith, \nNut, or Ptah.\nHave fun with this one. :). And remember 10 points to who gets it right. [SEP] best_answer: Aker is an earth god who presided over the borders of the underworld.\nAmun is associated with the primordial air.\nKuk is associated with the primordial concept of darkness.\nAtum is the primal creator, associated with the sun.\nBabi is a baboon god.\nNun (also spelt Naunet or Nu) was the deification of the primordial water abyss.\n\nAnat is a war goddess.\nHathor is the personifaction of the Milky Way, often depicted as a cow.\nIsis is most famous for being the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus.\nNeith is a goddess of hunt and war.\nNut is the personification of night.\nAnd Ptah isn't a goddess at all, but the first god.\n\nSo the answer to 1 is Nun and the answer to 2 is either Anat or Neith.  But I would have to lean more towards Anat, as Neith is also considered a goddess of weaving.\nHope this answers your question!	Society & Culture

question_title: Why police is called cop? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: That is a tough one.. There are sought to be made explanations but.. sifting through all of them, I believe it is: Around the year 1700, the slang verb cop entered English usage, meaning "to get ahold of, catch, capture." By 1844, cop showed up in print, and soon thereafter the -er suffix was added, and a policeman became a copper, one who cops or catches and arrests criminals. Copper first appeared in print in 1846, the use of cop as a short form copper occured in 1859	Society & Culture

question_title: was Hamlet in love with Ophelia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, I think he was, and that was why he got so upset about her not getting too close to him.  He knew he was having a tough time mentally, and that he could not be involved with her.  He probably did not realize she would commit suicide herself as a result, but then they were, after all, pretty young.  Young people have a tendency to add so much drama to things, because a given experience is new to them, however old it is to the world.  Adolescent angst is a real thing, and I suppose it's not that surprising that suicide seems to be a major sorting mechanism among the young.  Those who believe themselves unfit for life choose death.  It's only rarely a wise choice.  I won't go into what those rare circumstances might be; each must decide.  But as I say, it is very rarely wise.\n\nTo be or not to be, that is the question.  You have heard the line so many times, you can recite it without thinking. But it pays to think about it:  are you going to go ahead with your life, and make of it all you can, or are you going to label yourself a loser and throw yourself away?  \n\nBefore you decide, please listen to me about suicide:  my loved one of over 20 years chose that way out on December 16, 2005.  I'm obviously still in the process of "getting over it," to the extent I ever will.  It is the most horrible experience of my life, and Please, God, it will always be.  I don't want to tempt any fates, but I cain't hardly get worse than being in the same apartment, and unavailable to a last-minute attempt to stop him, when someone commits suicide.\n\nBut even without that; even starting with discovering the body.  Or worse, having someone just disappear down some John or Jane Doe coroner's report, the loved ones never being sure, or only being notified after it's all been in the hands of the professionals (coroner's office being just the start, of course).  It's all heartbreaking, no matter how understanding and forgiving you can be about the person who took that way out of what they felt was intolerable.\n\nBut it was not really intolerable.  He just stopped tolerating it, and I have a hard time remembering that I forgive him for that.  But even though I do, really, I am in a far worse position now, and he probably believed he was doing me a favor, taking a burden off my hands.  That's hardly ever true in a case of suicide.  It's more an excuse.	Society & Culture

question_title: Do you honestly believe that if illegals were to be given amnesty that>? [SEP] question_content: the way we live and our culture would come to an end.They are already here.So any effects that you would feel,you have already been feeling. [SEP] best_answer: The problem is that the legalization elements have been all entwined in the guest worker program which is a really bad program.  One Senator ran projections of how many poor immigrants would come here under the program (on TOP of the current rate of immigration and on TOP of the current illegal immigrants) and he came up with 185 million to 217 million poor immigrants in the next 20 years.  Even California Senators Boxer and Feinstein who have been pushing for legalization as their main goal in the program voted against this element of the program. (They lost.)\n\nCan  your school and neighborhood fit and support that many poor immigrants?  Mine can't. Do you see that many jobs around? I don't.  This is a big business idea to keep wages depressed for unskilled and semi skilled labor into the indefinite future.\n\nIf the border is truly secured, I want to deport felons and want illegal immigrants to actively start learning English as a condition of legalization.  However, as you say, they are already here.  The problem is that if you say you want legalization people now say 'I want the guest worker program' and most of them don't have a clue what is in it.\n\nIf there is a way to frame the bill during conference into qualified illegal legalization plus MAJOR border security, I would be in favor of it.  To tell the truth, though, I'd rather have no bill at all than the Senate Bill in its current form.	Politics & Government

question_title: What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching. Knowing how to take the test is more important, under this system, than knowing what is on it. Further, the act has been severely underfunded. The act requires more qualified teachers (aka ones with more education), but more education means higher pay, which is something many school districts can't do.\n\nI think more importantly than any of those problems, there's the issue of how to measure improvement. Under the act each class is compared to the previous class, meaning this year's 2nd grade is compared to last year's 2nd grade. Now, obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair. People don't like to admit it, but some people have different base levels of intelligence. Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably, but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is, on average, not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of. Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers (comparing last year's 2nd grade scores to this year's 3rd grade scores). That is obviously the better way to do it, but making the switch is going to cost money, something the act has failed to provide.	Politics & Government

question_title: who are the biggest whiners of them all? [SEP] question_content: hippies?  democrats? [SEP] best_answer: I would say hippies, but on the grand scale it is the Democrats. They all seemed to like The Patriot Act when it first came out after 9/11 and then as soon as there started to be questions and a little bit of an uproar, the Democrats turned their backs on it and started to complain about it. But even while they only whined they never came out with a counter bill or proposal to The Patriot Act. If they disliked the Patriot Act so much then why not come up with their own plan to secure the US. Sure, Bush might not have done the most wonderful job but at least he did something. The Democrats after almost 6 years after 9/11 has announced that they are drawing up a plan to secure the US. That's very nice but where were they 6 years ago? It's time they stop whining and actually think before they jump on the "let's all hate Bush" bandwagon.	Politics & Government

Which just means that it is legal for a 17-year old to be sexually active.\n\nBut, in New York you still have to be 18 to be considered an adult. This did not change to 17. You need to be 18 to vote, purchase tabacco, serve your country, obtain credit without a co-signer, and live on your own without obtaining an emmancipation.\n\nBut, you can be tried as an adult before you turn 18.

question_title: Can a president be vice president after two terms in office? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: NO HE CANNOT.  \n\nThe Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution reads:\n\n"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."\n\nNow, it may not be as cut-and-dried as it looks.  The 25th Amendment says that a 2-term President ineligible to be *elected* again ... but it doesn't explicitely say that he is inelligible to *be* President again (i.e. if he were in the line of succession).  So he may not be disqualified from being Vice-President.  However, most constitutional scholars agree that the intent is to disqualify a third-term President by any means.  It is amazing to me that people who draft Amendments don't fix the wording so these things are completely unambiguous.\n\nInteresting Trivia:  Before the 12th Amendment (1804), the Vice-President was the second-place finisher in the Presidential election ... so the President and Vice-President were invariably from opposite parties.

The truth is that the casualties of this war are miniscule compare to vietnam which took over 700 Americans on average each day.\n\nThe United States is not the conquering nation that it is portrayed to be in the media.  If we were we would own Japan, half of Germany, and we would still have the panama canal.  We actually have a history of rescuing the people of countries from dictators.  Japan was under an Emperor and in five years after WWII we unilaterally helped the people form a democratic government run by the people of Japan. West Germany took longer (30 years) because we chose to work with the UN, but we formed a democracy there too and then left.    There are many more problems to deal with in Iraq than in Japan or Germany.  We are actually getting things done quickly in Iraq despite enormous difficulties caused by warring sects and the restrictions of the religion of Islam.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: PRINCETON, N.J. -- April 1999 -- More than 100 protesters denounced Princeton University on Saturday for hiring a philosopher whose extreme views include allowing parents to end the lives of their severely disabled infants. \n\n"Nazi Germany did the same thing to the disabled, judging their lives not worth living. We object to that," said John Scaturro, 49, who protested near the Ivy League school along with his wife and young daughter. \n\nUniversity officials stood by the appointment of Peter Singer, a professor whose academic work they say will contribute to scholarship and ethics debates at Princeton. \n\nSinger, a professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, was appointed last year to the Ira W. DeCamp Professorship of Bioethics at the university's Center for Human Values. He is to begin work in July. \n\nThe 52-year-old academic is widely considered the father of the international animal rights movement yet has argued parents should have the right to euthanize newborn children who have severe handicaps. \n\nIn his books, Singer has said that children less than one month old have no human consciousness and do not have the same rights as others. \n\n"Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person," he wrote in one book. "Sometimes it is not wrong at all." \n\nHis appointment at Princeton has drawn fierce opposition from pro-life groups, the disabled and others.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are you think human right is observed in Iran? [SEP] question_content: What is the human right for iranian?Are you think human right is observed in Iran [SEP] best_answer: No religious state is observant of human rights.  The rights of humans as human beings begins with separating religion from the state.  People cannot be forced to participate in or contribute to a religion that they do not believe in, and cannot be prevented from practicing a religion that they believe in.  When the state demands that all its people practice a religion and forbids any other, it not only is violating human rights, but is totalitarian and dictatorial.\n\nThat is why the US Constitution's list of things that are forbidden to the government begins right away with "Congress shall pass no law establishing a religion, nor prohibit the free exercises thereof."\n\nOther human rights that a government is wrong to prohibit include but are not limited to: freedom of speech, of the press, of peaceable assembly, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances.\n\nYou will find more information on the rights of humans here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights\n\nI don't think Iran meets the criteria for a state that recognizes human rights, and I don't think that it recognizes that it doesn't.

[SEP] question_content: In the Chicagoland area it is a ban in nightclubs, bars, pool halls and every where else that smokers goto to have fun. Its the same in Madison, Wis. There is a smoking ban just about everywhere you go. If you are a non-smoker then dont frequent places where smokers are and vice-versa for smokers. Everyone has the right to smoke if they want. They say smoking causes second hand Canser, well if that is so then seeing people eat to much causes eye canser. You all know what I mean. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think that smoking should be banned in bars and in clubs. If they are banning things that are bad for you they wouldn't be able to drink there either. I think that if you are so health oriented you shouldn't be in the bar so if you don't want to be around smokers don't go in the bar. Drinking and smoking go hand in hand and some people that drink like to smoke only when they drink. I think it should be up to the bar owner. If the waitresses don't like being around it , get another job at a bar that doesn't allow smoking.	Politics & Government

Police reports, public records, interviews with police, and media accounts were all included. Offenders were located in 36 states, but it is clear, that the most of the offenders were located in states with the highest numbers of illegal immigrants. California was number one, followed by Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Florida. How many are here for a better life and how many are not? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I've seen it happening in my area for many years. Illegal hispanic men 'dating' and impregnating girls from the age of ten on up. Not to mention that I've heard many of them say that any unescorted female going about her business was 'asking for it'.  But things are changing a little around here. Every pregnant girl under the age of sixteen is referred to the DA as a rape victim and perpetrators are getting an average of five years in prison. I'm glad something is being done to stop this.\n\nSome of the ones going to prison did not impregnate the girl. Many of the idiots freely admit to having sex with underage girls because they think nothing will be done.\n\nCrazybird's answer reminded me of something my ex-husband told me. He is from a small village in Mexico. He said that when a man wanted to find a wife (if he couldn't find one at home) he and his friends would go to a neighboring village and take a woman. They would bring her back and force the 'marriage' on her. Her family would not object because they considered it to be too late to do anything about it.	Politics & Government
question_title: WHAT DID PRETZELDUNCE LUSH LlE ABOUT TODAY? [SEP] question_content: DID HE MAKE UP NEW WORDS THAT DO NOT EXIST AND SOUND LIKE A RETARD AS USUAL?  DID HE FINALLY 'MAKE THE PIE HIGHER?' [SEP] best_answer: Bush admitted that he lied about spying on Americans. Bush said that the NSA has been keeping track of all cell phone calls since he put Porter in charge. Now he has fired Porter Goss, and put the military in charge. Right of Hitler's Gestapo play books. SS monitoring of the populations phone conversations. That means everybody, and this is worse than Watergate. They have absolutely every record, that's what they said on the news. Fascist Dictator is what I say. Bush needs impeached for being insane.

question_title: Do illegal immigrants get all these benefits that people claim they do? [SEP] question_content: If thats the case, where do I turn in my citizenship and join the rich? How ignorant can one be to believe that they get all of these claimed benefits?  Shame on you and your lies. [SEP] best_answer: Illegal immigrants -- or legal foreign tourists for that matter -- get Constitutional guarantees (Bill of Rights) like anyone else in the USA -- unless Pres. George W. Bush has designated them "enemy combatants".\n\nThey do not get very many "benefits" of financial value, except emergency health care (mainly: traffic accidents and childbirth). Their children born in the USA are US citizens, and the US Supeme Court held, particuarly with respect to education -- free schooling -- that they cannot be denied benefits based on their parents' status. Which makes sense apart from the Constitutional issue because it would mean raising a generation of illiterate citizens!\n\nParents of babies born in the USA get no benefit (other than as above) from that fact -- they can be and are deported. In one case (you can Google "Myrna Dick") a judge held that a woman alleged to be in the US illegally (she had been brought to the USA from Mexico at age 9 and married an American and was pregnant) could not be deported until after her baby was born. A good -- but charitable -- holding I think; difficult to justify on the grounds given (that the "fetus" is American). But it delighted some anti-abortion activists.	Politics & Government

question_title: What are some of the most common misconceptions about race/gender that you're bothered by? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I hate it when a black person assumes that because I am white I support slavery or ever had an ancestor who had slaves. They seem to forget it was blacks who sold them into slavery and white's who fought to free them. Not all whites supported slavery!  I think it was horrible but I am also sick of them thinking they are entitled because of it.  What about the jews? They were wronged too, what do they get?  The Indians we stole this land from were wronged, what do they get?  I think it is unfair that they can have all black beauty pageants, all black colleges, all black scholarships, we cannot have an all white anything or we would be in big trouble for discrimination, not that I would want to anyway, but how fair is that????!!!!!  I think everyone should have the same rights and I am sick of hearing how they think they have less rights when they actually have MORE.  They will get a job even if less qualified and I have seen first hand how they can sit around and do nothing and cannot be fired, by law, because company would be in trouble if they fired them.  I like black people, but it angers me to no living end that they get away with stuff like that!  I have black friends and have heard them make remarks about getting retribution one day.  That is a real pisser offer for me!!!!  I have done nothing wrong to them!	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: The movie theater had to be evacuated--a popcorn machine had caught on fire-- so we missed the end of the movie!   Doug had just rescued Claire from Carroll (exploding ambulance, etc...) and they were in her apt. when she pulled a gun on him and said "You're not really a cop... how did you know about my clothes, etc..." and she called his office to see if he was really an agent... Then the fire alarm went off and we left.  \n\nWe would REALLY appreciate a detailed description of what happened after this... I don't think it was very far to the end... \n\nHelp, PLEASE!  ;) [SEP] best_answer: First after she pulled the gun, she called his office and another cop gave a description of him. Then they rush to the ferry and plan on trying to get the bomb out. The girl was supposed to wait until the ferry left, while D.W. went on board to stop the bomb. As the bad guy left, D.W. went abroad the ferry. But while the bad guy was getting ready to leave on his motorcycle, he noticed the SUV and went back to the ferry. The girl saw this and in return jump back abroad the ferry.\n Now with all three of them on the ferry, D.W. was told by security to get up top, that the bottom was off limits. He agrees and looks for another way. The girl tryin to alert D.W. is caught by the bad guy. She is once again tied up and put in the SUV. D.W. now returns back to the SUV and begans a shoot out with the bad guy. With the security also firing at them both, D.W. ended up killing the bad guy with a shot in the head, with his last bullet. Then security comes at D.W. and he jumps in the SUV with the girl, now they only have a couple of minutes until the bomb goes off. So while the cops are trying to stop the SUV, they take off fliping over the edge. While under water the girl is saved by D.W. but he didn't get out and drowns or blows up with the blomb, which miss the ferry. So after all this, the present day D.W. shows up. And she asked him the same question he ask her while she was holding the gun. He responded the same and stop a second thinking that he felt Deja Vu but then shook it off and the movies end with them living the docks. I hope this helps	Entertainment & Music

Basically, you need to eat little and often to get your stomach used to food....eating a lot in one go will overload the stomach and could cause you to vomit.

question_title: Are you fat when you weigh 135 lbs., you're 13, and you're 5 ft. 3? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Goodness!!!  NO!!  I'm 36, I used to weigh 140 (down to 132) and even though I wasn't comfortable (weighing 110 all my life), I hardly felt I was fat!  And plus, you have an inch in height on me!\n\nSweety, you are ONLY 13.

question_title: How do I tune people out? [SEP] question_content: This is weird, but how do you turne people out? For example, when I work as a receptionist, I sit at a front desk, and sometimes I feel uncomfortable knowing that people might be staring at me.  I guess I'm alert and always know where people are and what they are looking at.  \n\nI went to a interview today at a company and the receptionist there looked so comfortable and didn't even look like she cared that other people where there.  I'm more the type that gets startled if someone comes up to me.  What can I do? [SEP] best_answer: Set up a schedule for the day and focus on your activities. Some people will be looking at you, but only because they are waiting for their appointment and have nothing better to do. Make sure there are magazines and things like that for people to look at. Try not to let it bother you-just keep busy and keep doing a good job!	Health

The lenses have something that's kind of like a weight on the bottom so that they sit straight on your eye.  There are a couple of different designs, so if one doesn't work for you, your eye doctor may try another.	Health
question_title: what is the cure for R.L.S. (restless leg syndrome)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is restless legs syndrome treated?\n\n\n\nAlthough movement brings relief to those with RLS, it is generally only temporary. However, RLS can be controlled by finding any possible underlying disorder. Often, treating the associated medical condition, such as peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, will alleviate many symptoms. For patients with idiopathic RLS, treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. \n\nFor those with mild to moderate symptoms, prevention is key, and many physicians suggest certain lifestyle changes and activities to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Decreased use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may provide some relief. Physicians may suggest that certain individuals take supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium. Studies also have shown that maintaining a regular sleep pattern can reduce symptoms. Some individuals, finding that RLS symptoms are minimized in the early morning, change their sleep patterns. Others have found that a program of regular moderate exercise helps them sleep better; on the other hand, excessive exercise has been reported by some patients to aggravate RLS symptoms. Taking a hot bath, massaging the legs, or using a heating pad or ice pack can help relieve symptoms in some patients. Although many patients find some relief with such measures, rarely do these efforts completely eliminate symptoms \n\nPhysicians also may suggest a variety of medications to treat RLS. Generally, physicians choose from dopaminergics, benzodiazepines (central nervous system depressants), opioids, and anticonvulsants. Dopaminergic agents, largely used to treat Parkinson's disease, have been shown to reduce RLS symptoms and PLMD and are considered the initial treatment of choice. Good short-term results of treatment with levodopa plus carbidopa have been reported, although most patients eventually will develop augmentation, meaning that symptoms are reduced at night but begin to develop earlier in the day than usual. Dopamine agonists such as pergolide mesylate, pramipexole, and ropinirole hydrochloride may be effective in some patients and are less likely to cause augmentation. \n\nIn 2005, ropinirole became the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of moderate to severe RLS. The drug was first approved in 1997 for patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\nBenzodiazepines (such as clonazepam and diazepam) may be prescribed for patients who have mild or intermittent symptoms. These drugs help patients obtain a more restful sleep but they do not fully alleviate RLS symptoms and can cause daytime sleepiness. Because these depressants also may induce or aggravate sleep apnea in some cases, they should not be used in people with this condition. \n\nFor more severe symptoms, opioids such as codeine, propoxyphene, or oxycodone may be prescribed for their ability to induce relaxation and diminish pain. Side effects include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and the risk of addiction. \n\nAnticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and gabapentin are also useful for some patients, as they decrease the sensory disturbances (creeping and crawling sensations). Dizziness, fatigue, and sleepiness are among the possible side effects. \n\nUnfortunately, no one drug is effective for everyone with RLS. What may be helpful to one individual may actually worsen symptoms for another. In addition, medications taken regularly may lose their effect, making it necessary to change medications periodically.

question_title: Cash Flow Streams Same Amounts but different NPV?

Given the choice you would select Option A as this yields the higher result, reflecting the fact that you have a higher amount of $$ in the early period of the cash flow stream.\n\nThe question remains:  why the same totals but different NPV [SEP] best_answer: It's only common sense. It is better to get 50,000 (more money) in the first year so that you can invest it elsewhere for additional profit, than to have 10,000 (less money)in the first year.  Money has time value. A dollar in year one worth more than a dollar in year five. Mathematics calculation only confirm this common sense.	Business & Finance

question_title: What was the worst job you ever had?  Or, who was your worst boss? What happened? [SEP] question_content: At a place that I worked, they actually took away your vacation time if you were late coming to work because of a snowstorm.  They said they had no idea if you were being truthful, for all they knew you could have been applying for another job.  Once, when the building had no power because a transformer blew, and they were told everyone had to leave the building, they told us were would be docked or have to use vacation time, because we could be using that time to look for other jobs.  \n\nThe worst ever was when there was a bomb threat.  They never told the workers, we only knew when we noticed everyone was outside (it was a multi-office building) and someone went out and asked.  They said there was a bomb threat, and management left the building "as a precaution" but we were to keep working.  Needless to say, we all left the building, then we were told we were being charged vacation time for the time we did not work until the building was cleared for everyone to go back in. [SEP] best_answer: i worked for a doctor that had medical supplies that expired in the early 80's in his office that he would not let me throw away.

question_title: Just married - need to change witholdings? [SEP] question_content: We just got married last month. I already owe this year, because when my son got a job and moved out last year, I forgot to change my witholdings at work (my fault). I was claiming Single 5 (Head of Household).\n\nIf I change my status to Married at this point, will I be taxed more heavily or will it be better for me?  What would work best for me?  Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: You should probably change your withholding so that it is more in line with your new situation.  If done correctly, it will end up so that you get more in your paycheck each week, but a smaller refund next year.\n\nBecause you are now married, you need to either file "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately".  It is tough to tell whether your tax will go up or down without more information, it you were going from single to married, total tax between you/spouse would probably go down.  But since it's HOH->married, it might go up.\n\nTypically, couples are better off filing jointly than separately, but that must be decided based on your circumstances.  I'd try both ways, and file whichever way gets you the lowest taxes.	Business & Finance

The Latin phrase Annuit Cœptis (He [God] has favored our undertaking) is located above the pyramid. NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM (New Order of the Ages) is shown on a ribbon below the pyramid.

When it ran i chose to create primary partition first and then i chose no to use part of my HDD and gave a size like 25%. When it was done i chose extended DOS partition to create other three logical DOS drives. For the extended DOS partition i chose to use the rest of my HDD for it. When done it asked me to create logical drives in it. I gave 33% for the 1st and 2nd one and the rest for the last one. when done i exited the fdisk program and rebooted the system and started installing windows 98.\n\nNow the above option is for the first time if u have no other PC.

[SEP] best_answer: Well I think I can help you if you can help me, I am looking for a '06 Corvette for around $10,000.  Okay, in all seriousness, the 17inch starts at $2700, so finding one at $700 is going to be impossible, unless it is nonfunctioning.

question_title: I need an ip address to go around the internet without being blocked.? [SEP] question_content: See in my school EVERYTHING is blocked. The only way you can get around is if you find an ip address to hide behind walls to use myspace or etc.\n\nWe had an ip address with this program that let us use myspace but unfortuantly too many people started using it so they blocked the ip address.\n\nI need an ip address to get around NOT websites urls. Anyone can help? =) [SEP] best_answer: This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I won’t have you on my top five list, huh?

question_title: Looking for the easiest Martial art to learn. Any recommendations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you're looking for a hard (striking) style, any of the variant forms of karate will fit the bill (kempo karate and shotokan karate are fairly popular).\nIf you're looking for a soft (throws, locks, etc) style, I agree with the aikido recommendation.  Especially if you just want to defend yourself and not strike people (Much easier to let the pavement, a convenient table, or bookcase strike them instead).  Aikido is very laid back and has a natural, non-aggressive feel to it.\nIf you want a little more aggression, try jiu-jutsu (the Gracie forms are great for winning tournaments) or judo.\n\nAnd if you want to have fun and try something really different, try capoeira.\n\nAll these styles and more are available for view at wikipedia.org, and most of the major styles have websites (ie. www.aikiweb.com for aikido)	Sports

question_title: Why is Michael Jordan the best basketball player ever? [SEP] question_content: I don't agree that he is... but tell me WHY YOU think he is.  Is it the number of 'rings'? Is it his scoring? Was it the shoes? What was it that made you believe Michael Jordan was the best basketball player in the history of the NBA?  I don't hear a lot of substanitive argument, just statements that people seem unwilling to defend or debate.\n\nSo come on, give it your best shot!   \n\n(After over 700 answers, this is my first question, and I'd really like to know why people believe what they do).  Thanks in advance for your responses! Have a good one!!! [SEP] best_answer: Well, let's see..... he can jump really high. Or maybe it's because he doesn't miss any shots. No, that can't be it. Perhaps, he's the best because he won slam dunk contests. Plus he pioneered the long baggy shorts. No, no, no....I think I got it:  ITS BECAUSE ESPN SAYS SO !!!!  Yeah, thats it.\n\nSeriously, sorry to break it to you folks, but Michael Jordan is not the best player of all time. There is no legitimate argument, period. He might be one of the most exciting players to watch, but in terms of all around talent, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are far and away much better. \n\nThe reason some people say Jordan is the best is because there has been no athlete in the past two decades who has been more over-hyped, more promoted, and more marketed than Michael Jordan. He could not possibly live up to those standards. Between movies, shoes, cereal boxes, fast food and everything else he's advertised, who hasn't heard of Michael Jordan ? \n\nHe came along at just the right time. David Stern became commissioner and heavily marketed the NBA to corporate America. What better face to put on it but Jordan. He played a flashier style of b-ball, be was polite and accesible to writers and fans. In other words, he was family friendly. But he played for the lowly Chicago Bulls.\n\nSo maybe if we increased the number of playoff teams from 12 to 16, the Bulls might make the playoffs and we can have Michael on t.v. more. And maybe if we added a slam dunk contest to the all-star game, people can see even more of Michael. Plus, we now have a 24 hour sports channel so nobody can possibly miss his high flying dunks and acrobatic moves.\n\nNow, I 'm not trying to take anything away from Jordan. He was a great player FOR HIS TIME. He had great talent and was exciting to watch. But as far as dominating the league, that didn't happen until Bird and Magic had gone and the league expanded to 27 and 29 teams, thereby depleting the talent pool.	Sports

Of course its not just that the Yanks have a new CF and lead-off man, but the signing took away from the Red Sox. Doesn't look like they're missing him yet though . . .\n\nIf the Yanks win it all and Damon contributes with some heroics, then yes, it'll have been all worth it of course.	Sports

question_title: pacman pacman.? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone agree with me that the pacman will eat barerra alive? manny Pacquiao ofcourse. [SEP] best_answer: Barrera will definitely avoid being knocked out.  He won't fight like Morales did.  Morales was too aggressive.  Pacman and Roach called it correctly that Morales would try to finish the match early because he fears he wouldn't have the stamina for an extended battle.\n\nBarrera however is a different case.  Remember when Pacman beat him the first time, it wasn't a knock down.  The man was standing when his corner threw in the towel.  I'm guessing this means he can take Pacman's punches (although it reduced him to a punching bag).\n\nI think Pacman will get UD victory over Barrera this time.  The judges will probably not look very favorably to Barrera running away.\n\nSantana-\nWhy did you say that Pacman is avoiding Marquez.  As I recall, Pacman did ask for a rematch and it was Marquez who said no.  But in any case, I am willing to concede that Pacman might have lost that fight.  But he has learned a lot since.  He came into that fight overconfident thinking that he has nothing left that needs improvement.  But that fight and the fight against Morales showed him what the skills are that he lacked.	Sports
question_title: What's more important: Offense, Starting Pitcher, or the Bullpen? [SEP] question_content: IMO the bullpen is. I've never seen a World Champ that didn't have a great bullpen.

question_title: Why are the Detroit Pistons losing to the Miami Heat, Detroit is a far better team, but they are being beaten? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I may not get the best answer for this, because you are obviously a Pistons fan and I am not, but there are several reasons, and if you are open minded, you will see that I am right.\n\n1.  Detroit is the 2006 version LA Lakers of the 2004 NBA Finals. A favorite to win, yet so cocky that they believe that they cannot lose.  The media has only perpetuated this. i.e. Even after almost falling to the Cavs (the Cavs?!) most people had them as favorites against the Heat.  Had the media pegged the Pistons as even or underdogs, that may have motivated them some, but as Flip Saunders has said himself, Detroit feels like the "Fat Cats."  \n\n2.  Miami only had their "core" together for 9 games (8 or 9, im not sure) this entire season.  Thats not much for a team that was assembled about 7 months ago.  They are just now finding out how to play as a team.\n\n3.  No one thinks about the fact that Detroit and Miami have the same record in the second half of the season.  Thats right, Detroit DOES NOT have a better record than Miami in the second half of the season, and the Heat, have a far better playoff record than the Pistons.  As Shaq has said, "the regular season don't mean nothing."\n\n4.  Miami is a deeper team than Detroit.  Look at Detroit, after McDyess and maybe Hunter, they have no one coming off the bench that is a threat.  Detroit was deeper last year, but foolishly made a trade with the Magic that only made them worse.  In effect, Detroit gambled that their starting five would not get injured or fatigued.\n\n5.  As a Piston fan, you're tired of hearing this, I'm sure, as I am tired of saying it, but lets face the facts, Wade and O'neal would have gone to the Finals last year, had they not BOTH been injured.  \n\n6.  The Pistons never admit that they need to adjust anything.  Example, whenever the Pistons lost games this year it was attributed to "boredom" with the NBA.  C'mon, boredom?  Their "If it aint rought it aint right" slogan is a cop out.  And whenever they lose (especially to the Heat) they give no credit to Miami, which has infuriated, and motivated them.  Admittedly, the Pistons ARE the best comeback team in the NBA, but do they LIKE going down 3-2 or 3-1, I dont think so.\n\n7.  The emergence of a true superstar.  Dwyane Wade is becoming a super-superstar in front of their very eyes.  The best defense cannot stop him, no one can stop him.  Dwyane Wade is becoming the Flash.\n\nHaving said all that, I will also tell you what every other Heat fan won't.  I am scared shitless, that SOMEHOW Detroit will win the series.  I mean if they win the Next 2 games, game 7 is up for grabs, and Phoenix did it earlier this year, and San Antonio almost did it.  So although it is not likely, it is possible, that Detroit will win.  I know it and every Miami fan on the planet knows it.  But thats where we differ, Miami fans and players admit that they can be beaten, whereas, Detroit fans and Pistons will still think they can win, even after they've lost.  I hope this is Miami's year, and it SEEMS like it, but if anyone can beat them, it's Detroit.\n\nGO HEAT!	Sports

Toujours la même allure sur un temps donné (30, 40 ou 60 minutes).\nFaire de la course à pieds signifie plutôt qu'on s'entraîne d'une manière diversifiée.

Tout ça pour améliorer ses performances et faires des compétitions.\nVoilà, personnellement, la différence que je fais entre les deux.\n\nAu fait, El Pechin, fartlek, c'est suédois.\n\nPetit ajout à propos de ton autre question, Cordelia, un type qui fait de la course à pieds selon la définition sur laquelle nous somme d'accord, fais du jogging (ou un ptit footing :-)) POUR RÉCUPÉRER !
