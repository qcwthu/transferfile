question_title: Is Jessica Alba making too big of a deal about being on the cover of Playboy?

It is really sore but not like pain where i need to cry. My hand is tinglin and is sore too what happend? The doc x rayed and said it is back in place and he said i have rotary cup damage what does that mean? He said i may need surgery why is that? I am supposed to check the circulation in my hand every one in awhile by checking my finger nails why do i have to do that? Do i have to wear the colar and cuff that he gave me? \nIt just mainly hurt whn u move it forward to the side is ok [SEP] best_answer: OK...you have a fresh injury an you're going to feel the consequences of that with sore muscles and pulled ligaments.  the Rotator cuff is what keeps your arm in it's socket and helps it move around, similar to your knee joint.  If you have an injury, on the inside of the joint, you may need surgery.  Checking the circulation by pressing the fingernails indicates if the blood in your injured arm is circulating.  If your fingernails are a blue or black color, then the oxygen in the blood is not circulating properly and you should report this condition asap to your doctor.  Wear the collar and cuff for a few days and mend before you start to worry about the surgery and getting back to normal activities.  Your body uses rest to heal.  So...rest.  Then call your doctor with any other questions.  \n\nGlad you weren't seriously injured.	Health
question_title: Should i get a medicine ball or a toning tube for working out? [SEP] question_content: I bike quite often, but i'd like to help exercise various parts of my body. I'm thinking of getting a medicine ball (or a fitness ball/stability ball). I'm also thinking of getting a toning tube set. What do you think would be best? [SEP] best_answer: I would get the toning tubes first.  The resistance bands are good for working out all parts of your body and you can do many exercises with them.  Next, I'd get the stability ball.  You can use that in combination with the toning tubes and do even more exercises.  A medicine ball is different than a stability ball.  The stability ball is the big inflatable ball that you sit or balance on.  A medicine ball is a smaller weighted ball.  It is good for doing weighted crunches and other weighted ab/core exercises.  I'd get that last just because it has the least uses of the 3.	Health

[SEP] question_content: Spent $13,000 in 2001 trying to save genetically bad tooth structure. Now the gold lined crowns are breaking off at the gum line. I am younger than most who need dentures and have been putting this off till I just cant anymore. Doctor says I will get infections in my blood and possibly even my heart because of the teeth that have broken off so far. BUT I AM SO SCARED AT HOW I WILL LOOK!!!! AND I NEED TO HAVE 22 TEETH EXTRACTED FIRST!!! I can go to Tucson, AZ (110 miles away) if I have to to get dentures that will look and fit well and not cost me an arm and a leg. (Financially, not in the position to pay a lot anymore.)  Anyone with any ideas out there??? Please!!!! [SEP] best_answer: I'd say go to Tuscon and have a dentist check it out. Better to have it done now then wait. In phoenix the upper denture cost about $1500.00 and lower partial about $700.----$1200. depending on if you want metal or what they call a "soft partial" made of acrillic. Then too, you can go to Nogales for about half that price or less. I hear they do just as good of work as here. Just have to find the right dentist. Good luck	Health
question_title: Is my belly button piercing normal? [SEP] question_content: I got my belly button pierced last week and it's still kinda sore at the top. The area surrounding the top part of the ring is darkening somewhat. Is this normal also? Will the darkness go away or should I start using fade cream? [SEP] best_answer: it will be sore for a few weeks yet or even months, it all depends on your body and how long it takes to heal. the darkened area will prob just be bruising from the piercing. When i had mine done this all happened and had gunk all round it for a while. Get some salt water in an egg cup and soak it for a few mins every day. this will help the healing process.if it starts bleeding or starts worrying you go o the doctors or the place where you got it done just to be sure.x	Health
question_title: Medical test - Calcium vs Corrected Calcium level? [SEP] question_content: What is the difference between Calcium and Corrected Calcium stated in medical test?\nWhat does it means? [SEP] best_answer: albumin binds calcium to a large extent, patients with abnomal albumin content will have abnormal calcium levels for this reason.\n\nThe only (never say only in medicine) active calcium in your body is NOT protein bound.  So what really matters is the ionized version.  Simple formulas based on the ratios of albumin/calcium binding help to estimate the physiologic calcium level.\n\nIonized calcium can be tested for directly, and corrected levels are simply a guess.

question_title: I really can't stand myself...? [SEP] question_content: If I knew somebody who was exactly like me, I would completely hate them. I don't understand how I have any friends. I'm often sarcastic and I hold up my feelings until I have to let them out, so when I do everybody gets sick of me complaining for a while about whatever has been bothering me. I'm also really shy, so it's hard for me to appear friendly to anybody. I can also tell that people are getting tired of my complaining about how I hate my physical appearance. I know I'm not fat, but instead of focusing on how I'm fortunate to be the weight I am, I only think about how much thinner I can be. I don't like anything about myself, really... I don't know what to do. How can I improve myself and my view of myself? [SEP] best_answer: You have just described 95 percent of the women in America.  Everyone has feelings like this.  The media helps make us sarcastic, feel like we don't have things good enough, and are nowhere near thin or pretty enough.  Maybe watching less TV would improve your outlook - it did for me.  \n\nObviously your friends see things that they like in you.  You can always ask them what they like about you. Try to do activities with them when you're together, like sports, playing games, etc., instead of just "hanging out" and talking, so you'll be more likely to be active and have new things to talk about, and less likely to ruminate and complain.\n\nJust a couple suggestions.  But don't think you have some serious disorder or anything - you sound perfectly normal to me.	Health

question_title: can anyone tell me about aortic stenosis in children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a condition where the last valve going out of the heart is not opening wide enough as the blood is being pumped out of the ventricle (the largest chamber of the heart).  AS can be a rather serious condition and if symptomatic, usually manifests in shortness of breath, lack of tolerance to exercise, and chest pain.  It may have no symptoms for many years other than a harsh mumur heard by stethoscope.  \n\nI have known cases where mild or moderate stenosis is monitored for sometime until it progresses to severe and/or becomes symptomatic.  This sometimes takes 20 years or more in an adult.  Regular monitoring via echocardiogram should be done serially (maybe once a year until there's evidence of decline then every 3 months) to gauge the condition's progress.  There is a point where the condition made be stable for some time.  Once it gets critical its time to fix it.  \n\nTo fix the problem an open heart procedure and new valve needs to be implanted.  This is a big surgery and should not be done unless absolutely indicated.  \n\nTwo types of valves exist.  Tissue valves and mechanical valves.  The tissue valves have shorter lives but do not require chronic anticoagulation medication.  Mechanical valves last for a long time and do not wear out but DO require oral anticoagulation medication.  \n\nThere are special issues with children considering the fact that their heart is going to grow and therefore require a different size valve as the heart grows.  I have not direct experience with valve replacement with children but I would imagine you want to delay the surgery for as long as possible until his/her heart is close to adult size if possible (eliminating the need to go in multiple times to replace the valve as it becomes too small).  \n\nYour goals would need to be balanced between watching for symptoms, reducing the need for multiple surgeries, and managing the condition once the surgery has been done with the need for anticoagulation medication or not.

He's just married Juliet, the love of his life. Everything is perfect until about an hour or so after his wedding to Juliet, when he kills Tybalt.\n\nPer the Prince's decree in Act I, Scene i, anyone caught engaging in a civil brawl will be put to death. Romeo should be killed. Instead, Prince Escalus exiles him. Here's where everything starts going wrong.\n\nJuliet gets sad and wants to kill herself. Her daddy wants her to marry Count Paris. Everything sucks. So she goes to see Friar Lawrence, who gives her the potion which will make her appear dead.\n\nUnfortunately, Romeo does not receive the Friar's message that Juliet is just faking her death. He thinks she has really died. He goes to her tomb and quaffs the poison. When Juliet wakes up, she finds Romeo dead. Despite Friar Lawrence's protest, she refuses to leave and stabs herself with the dagger.\n\nThe play is a tragedy because it has an unhappy ending and because the heroes (Romeo and Juliet) are brought down by their fatal flaws (their immaturity and impatience).

question_title: A car dealership sold me a used car that they misrepresented as new. What should I do. Should I sue?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Was the car used...or did it have mileage on it from being a "demo" or a "loaner".  You might want to double check to make sure that the car has an MSO "Manufacturer's Statement of Orgin" .  That is the "title" you get from the manufacture.  When you take ownership, after that, you and everyone else that owns the car would get a true title.  If you received an MSO instead of a title the car would still be considered new.  If it had miles on it they might have used it for a demo (owner or manager or even salespeople get to drive the car since they work there)  or they could have some type of event that allowed them to let someone borrow the car for a while.  Oldsmobile used to let officials from the college world series drive new olds while the series was going on.  When they were finished, Oldsmobile would give credit to the dealers so they could sell the car at a discounted price.  The car was still new but.....had some miles on it.	Education & Reference

The midis are usually free, but you pay extra for the real tones.\n\nWhat is most helpful is the "upload personal files" in the "my locker" section of the "my mixxer" menu. It allows you to select a file from your computer, pick what segment you want to use as your ring-tone and store it in your locker.

question_title: I need a smart computer nerd that knows php well.? [SEP] question_content: I have apache installed, configured, and running on my computer. I have php installed and configured. I have apache configured to run php. Now I'm supposed to test it on a web page with the script \n<?php\nphpinfo()\n?>\n\n...and then save the file as a .php file. Then I'm supposed to open it to see if the test works.\n\nThe question is, HOW in the world do you open it THROUGH a a server without loading it onto a real website? I know html very well and I know how to make websites and webpages, but this book I am using to learn php really drops the ball on this step. I was under the impression that APACHE is the server I'm supposed to use to open it, but it doesn't say that. It doesn't make any sense. Can anyone help me? Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: you should rung the apache on your local machine then put the php file where you've defined as the DocumentRoot on apache's httpd.conf.\nthen call it on the browser like:\nhttp://localhost/example.php or http://127.0.0.1/example.php\n\nalso check the like for a real good apache-php-mysql suite	Computers & Internet

question_title: Differences in pipelines in video cards? [SEP] question_content: 10, 12, 14, etc.\n\nWhat's the deal with "pipelines" when it comes to video cards? How would nVidia's SLI increase, decrease the numbers? [SEP] best_answer: Similar to the way a CPU has a pipeline filled with small stages that each do a single task quickly, so too does the GPU in your video card. \nWhat this does is take a large task, and break it down into smaller stages.  This allows you to do multiple things at once and make your overall clock speed equivalent to the slowest of those stages. \n\nPipelined GPU:\n    * Wash\n    * Wash->Dry\n    * Wash->Dry->Fold\n    * Dry->Fold\n    * Fold\n\nThe more pipelines a video card contains, the faster and better the image will be processed and rendered. Thats why SLI is so efficient.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how can you find our when web page last modified? [SEP] question_content: I have already attempted entering javascript:alert(document.lastModified) in address bar however this reflecting current time and date. [SEP] best_answer: document.lastModified will not work when the page is transmitted from server to client. It reflects the local time because that's the time the page was stored in the "Temporary Internet File" directory. It shows that in javascript, document.lastModified gets only the locally modified time. So, you must manually type time and date each time you modify your web-page. However I think there are some options in server sided scriptings to detect the last modified date in servers. I am not used to it.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Is Pentium M better than P4s, which one is faster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Intel's Pentium M (m is for "mobile") and P4 are different style chips, so it is difficult to compare them on clock speed alone.  \n\nWhen I purchased my laptop (two years ago), I did some research on this topic.  The claim at that point was that the 1.6 MHz mobile was about the same as a 3.5 MHz P4.  This may have been in PC Magazine or something online.  (Can't find the source quickly.)\n\nThe main thing is that the M chips suck less energy, which is good in laptops, where battery life and heat are more important.	Computers & Internet
question_title: why is there no volcanos in canada? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually Canada IS on the Ring of Fire, which circles the Pacific Ocean more or less.\n\nCanada does have volcanoes on its west cost where the Rockies and Cascades continue north out of the United States.  \n\nYou don't have to be on the Ring of Fire to have volcanoes either, just along an active fault typically.  There are volcanoes all over the world where the plates meet.  Canada doesn't have volcanoes over most of its land though because it is spread across a continental plate which is too thick in the middle to have hot spots (like the Pacific plate does where we see the Hawaiian islands).  Where it meets the Pacific and Juan de Fuca plate in the west though there is enough movement to form mountains and strato volcanoes (like Mt. St. Helens which is not far from Canada, in Washington State).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can people all over the world see the "little dipper?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Little Dipper is near the north celestial pole, and contains Polaris (the North Star). It's only visible by people who live north of the Earth's equator.\n\nMost places on the Earth have some part of the sky that is never visible. The exception being people who live near the equator. \nAs you move away from the equator, you lose the ability to see stars near the far pole (i.e. as you move south you lose the ability to see stars near the north pole), and the further away you go the less of the opposite hemisphere you're able to still see. Once you reach the pole you can only see stars in your hemisphere.\n\nPeople who live south of the equator can't see the stars near the north pole (like the little dipper) and people who live north of the equator can't see the Southern Cross or the Magellanic clouds.\n\nHowever, as long as you don't live at one of the poles you can see some stars in the other hemisphere - just not all of them.

It is the white stuff seen on rocks where lots of birds hang out. Very concentrated and smells real strong. It is not bird poop.  It is CONCENTRATED urinary system wastes like our urine, but these organisms need to conserve and reabsorb excretory system water to prevent deydration and to help them weigh less when flying (so as to not store it in a bladder that is too heavy when they're taking off, landing,flying!) and so they "excrete" concentrated, more solid excretory wastes.\n\nSince uric acid crystals have many mineral and organic molecules, they are used as fertilizer.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was going to write this all out to explain it to you, but this website said exactly what I was going to say, but better and with more detail...\n\n"Base 60 (Sexagesimal) Numbering system\n\nThe Sumerian culture developed the Sexagesimal Numbering system some 4000 to 6000 years ago. This system was developed into a rigorous numbering system. The digits used were symbols which represented syllables instead of letters that were pressed into clay tablets. There were symbols representing ones and tens and were combined to represent the number of each place value.  See the following site for more information about the Sumerian numbering system. http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/index.html\n\nEach place value to the left is equal to 60 times the place value to the right which implies that each place value to the right is equal to the place value to the left divided by 60. It was up to the context of the number to determine where the place values began. Also, the place values may be fractions of base 60 numbers, ie. 1/60, 1/3600, etc.\n\n3600, 60, 1, 1/60, 1/3600 \n\nThe use of 60 as a grouping number was used by many cultures throughout our earth's history. This may be because 60 has many factors, including 12 (which also has many factors) and was convenient to use for trading, counting, etc. because of its divisibility. Our notations of time into 60 seconds and 60 minutes uses a from of this numbering system, but is not as rigorous because of the 24 for hours and the subdivisions of seconds into milliseconds, etc."	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the meaning of biosphere reserve? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Background and context\n\nBiosphere reserves are areas nominated by national governments and designated under the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Since 1976, UNESCO has designated 356 members of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 90 countries. These include 13 National Nature Reserves (NNRs) in the UK, designated in 1976/77.\n\nAs the intended functions of biosphere reserves have evolved considerably since the late 1970s, many biosphere reserves designated then do not match the current criteria well. These criteria are incorporated in "The Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves" (the Statutory Framework), adopted by the General Assembly of UNESCO in 1995.\n\nArticle 9 of the Statutory Framework requires concerned authorities to submit a report on the status of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction to the MAB Secretariat every ten years. In 1997, UNESCO requested the UK government to submit such a report with respect to all UK biosphere reserves. To date, the UK government has not submitted this report to UNESCO. This delay is regarded as constructive by the International Advisory Committee for Biosphere Reserves, which recognises the need for governments to undertake thorough reviews of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction.\n\nObjectives of the study\n\nThis study considers the application of the criteria defined in the Statutory Framework with respect to the UK. Two main objectives were defined in the terms of reference:\n\n   1. to consider the concepts supporting biosphere reserves and provide advice on their relevance and value in the light of other designations across the UK;\n   2. to determine if there is any real wildlife gain (i.e., benefits to wildlife) to be achieved by adopting the designation in the UK and, if so, under what circumstances.\n\nFollowing discussion with DETR, the report takes a wider view of the benefits of biosphere reserves as "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale", as defined in the Statutory Framework.\n\nEvolution of the biosphere reserve concept\n\nBiosphere reserves have three characteristics that, at least in principle, differentiate them from other ‘protected areas’: they are part of an international network of sites designated by UNESCO, rather than by national governments; their outer boundary is flexible, rather than being legally defined; and the land and water they contain is administered and managed by more than one agency or owner. In fact, only the first of these characteristics defines all biosphere reserves. According to the criteria in the Statutory Framework, they should have three zones: a legally constituted core area(s) devoted to long-term protection, according to the conservation objectives of the biosphere reserve, and of sufficient size to meet these objectives; a buffer zone(s) clearly identified and surrounding or contiguous to the core area or areas, where only activities compatible with the conservation objectives can take place; and an outer transition area where sustainable resource management practices are promoted and developed.\n\nThis scheme has evolved over three decades, reflecting both experiences of practical application and wider trends in the fields of conservation and resource management, particularly the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the growing recognition of the need to involve local people in the management of protected areas. The emphasis of the biosphere reserve concept has shifted from the promotion of conservation, science, and education to the notion of "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale" within a global network providing unique opportunities for exchanges of experience and collaborativ	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes anxziety? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The following are all believed to play a role in the occurrence of anxiety disorders:\n\nheredity \nbrain chemistry \npersonality \nlife experiences \nHeredity and anxiety disorders:\nThere is clear evidence that anxiety disorders run in families. Studies show that if one identical twin has an anxiety disorder, the second twin is more likely to have an anxiety disorder than non-identical (fraternal) twins. These findings suggest that a genetic factor, possibly activated in combination with life experiences, predisposes some people to these disorders.\n\nBrain chemistry and anxiety disorders:\nBecause symptoms of anxiety disorders are often relieved by medications that alter levels of chemicals in the brain, scientists believe that brain chemistry appears to play a role in the onset of anxiety disorders.\n\nPersonality and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that personality may play a role in the development of an anxiety disorder, noting that people who have low self-esteem and poor coping skills may be more prone. Conversely, an anxiety disorder that begins in childhood may itself contribute to the development of low self-esteem.\n\nLife experiences and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that the relationship between anxiety disorders and long-term exposure to abuse, violence, or poverty is an important area for further study, as life experiences may affect an individual's susceptibility to these disorders.

A 2x2 box is the most commonly seen.  I'll use this as my example:\nDraw a square. Inside, draw a plus sign, so that you get 4 identical squares inside the larger square.\nNow, we need two 'breeders.'  Let's say Dad has brown hair, with resessive blond; Bb.  Mom is the same way; Bb.\nAt the top of the square, write Dad's alleles (the big and little 'b')...one per column.  On the left side, place Mom's alleles...one per row.\nNow, multiply.\nIn the four squares, you should end up with the following:\n1 BB\n2 Bb\n1 bb\n\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that if Mom and Dad have 4 kids, the odds are they will have 3 with brown hair and one blond.  (Hopefully Dad understands recessive alleles, or Mom might have some explaning to do.)\n\nWill every 4th kid be blond?  No.  But, each kid will have a 1 in 4 chance of being blond, and 3 in 4 chance of being brunette.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is preparative thin layer chromatography? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: its a method of seperating individual molecules from a compound by placing samples on a special sheet coated with a material that will allow the molecules to seperate easily.  Then you put the place with samples in a developing chamber that will pull the molecules apart based on polarity.  That's not the best description in scientific terms, but that's pretty much how it works.  You just compare the distance each molecule traveled with the distance known molecules would travel in the same situation and it gives you a pretty good indicator as to what the unknown compound is composed of.

question_title: If molar extinction coefficient is unknown, can concentration still be found in grams rather than moles? [SEP] question_content: Only the absorbance is known (as wel as l) [SEP] best_answer: A=E*d*C\n\n(d=length of the path of the light through the solution)\n\nIf you have only one value of absorbance then obviously there is no way of determining the concentration without the molar extiction coefficient (E).\n\nIn practice even if you know E, you don't use it to find the unknown concentration. Instead you measure the A of standard solutions and do a standard curve. From the equation of that curve (which you find using linear regression) and the value of A of your sample you calculate the unknown amount. \nThe standard curve doesn't need to be A vs mole/lt. It can be A vs anything e.g. g/ml, mg/ml, ppm or even just g, mole, etc. the only thing that changes is what the slope represents.\nFor example for A vs mole/lt the slope corresponds to E*d, for A vs g/lt the slope corresponds to E*d/MW, etc.\n\nIf you  always have the same volume of sample you can do the curve A vs grams directly. Then if V is the volume of the sample, the slope corresponds to E*d*V/MW\n\nEven if your standard curve is expressed in moles/lt you can convert it to grams.

[SEP] best_answer: Kinetic energy Ek\n\nlet's consider that an object with a mass m moves on a distance d = x1 - x2, with an acceleration a and its velocity changes from v1 to v1, under the action of a force F\n\naccording to Galileo's law:\nv2^2 - v1^2 = 2.a.d\n\nbut according to Newton's second law:\nF = m.a\n\n-> a = F/m \n-> v2^2 - v1^2 = 2.F.d/m\n-> m.v2^2 - m.v1^2 = 2.F.d\n-> m.v2^2/2 - m.v1^2/2 = F.d\n\nbut W = F.d = the work done while the force F moves the object on the distance d, it caracterizes a process\n\nBut energy is the capacity of an object of doing work, it caracterizes a state\n\nthe kinetic energy is due to the velocity of the object:\n\ndeltaEk = E2 - E1 = W = F.d \n-> E2 = m.v2^2/2\n-> E1 = m.v1^2/2\n\nPotential energy Ep\n\nLet's consider an object with a mass m is falling from a height h1 to h2. \n\nThe work done by gravity is:\n\nW = G.(h1-h2) = m.g.(h1-h2) = m.g.h1 - m.g.h2\n\nThe potential energy is depending on the position of the the object as compared to the Earth and its equal with the work done by gravity taken with opposite sign.\n\ndelta Ep = Ep2 - Ep1 = - W\n\n-> Ep2 = m.g.h2\n-> Ep1 = m.g.h1	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Taking Amitriptyline and Citalopram (Celexa) at the same time? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend is on Citalopram, and my doctor perscribed me Amitriptyline for sleep (which doesn't work..), but my doctor told me to make sure that she didn't take any Amitriptyline with Citalopram.  We were just wondering why, and what would happen if she did.  I know they are both anti-depressants, I just want to know what exactly will happen.  Also, wanted to know what will happen if she took that with Xanax, but the other question is more important. [SEP] best_answer: The drug literature that the FDA required the manufacture of Celexa to print stated that using Celexia with TCA's (of which amitriptyline is one of that class) should be done with caution.\n\nThere are several reasons for this, and I only mention a few:\n\nThe only drug interaction test done between Celexia was with another TCA given in a single dose, to see if it affected the blood levels of Celexia. It may take several weeks of taking both drugs together for the full effects of changes in blood levels of either drug to be fully known.\n\nThere is no reason to prescibe drugs with common goals, as antidepressants (since the primary use of Amitriptyline is to treat depression, even though side effects of drowsiness sometime promote its use as a sleep aid)\n\nThere are possible additive effects to the side effects of dry mouth, sexual, and impared mental function that would serve no useful purpose.\n\nIf she did develop an unusual condition the doctor would not know which drug was causing it or if it was a drug interaction, or whatever. It makes the job of the doctor more difficult to determine what to do.\n\nAlso, in some people, amitriptyline can cause heart problems, (a good reason to keep the bottle well away from children, and with a safety cap).\n\n\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020822s29lbl.pdf	Science & Mathematics

If you are using a Sunday Ticket type broadcast maybe BUT the games are still carried on NETWORK TV. It doesn't matter if they are on Cable or no Cable it is NETWORK on Fox and CBS. They do add the delay for live broadcast and it DOES have to do with the FCC. The NETWORK stations have to follow FCC Decency rules and use the delay to bleep anything they need to bleep.	Sports

question_title: what is revenue sharing and how does it work? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: all the revenue generated by the league and teams through tv contracts, team sales (jerseys, footballs, hats, etc) is placed into a pot and then divided equally among all teams. This means that some teams generate more revenue and put a larger amount of money into the pot. Also, the players union wants its share of the money also. They asked for 60% of revenue, meaning that 60% of all revenue would have to be spent on player contracts. Hope this helps	Sports

question_title: how is the turkey carcass used as a predictor of the upcoming winter.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you have to chip it out of 3 feet of ice its going to be a bad winter.\nIf your girlfriend is using them as slippers its going to be a bad winter.\nIf it died in taking refuge in a bears behind, its going to be a baaad winter.\nIf it got hit by a semi on the freeway while trying to hitch hike to California, then it's going to be a bad winter.\n\nOn the more serious side, turkeys like most forest animals accumulate more fat previous to harsh winters. Of course you would say food source is a factor, this is true, but studies have also proven( including the farmers almanac) that one of the main staples for deer and turkey, acorns, actually are also more generated to have a large crop prior to a more harsh winter.

question_title: do you  think  this  is right ?!? [SEP] question_content: We are more interested in making others believe that we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves??!! [SEP] best_answer: Many people are like that, for several reasons. It could be for intimidation, or just because people don't want to worry family and friends. Normally, people are unhappy because of the everyday problems that arouse as we go on. Things like money, office work, children, social problems, health problems, and many others don't necessarily make one unhappy, but most people faced with these things don't try to appear unhappy.\nBut, on the other hand, many people are not like that. Many people are in love with life and are as happy as can be. they don't need to make others believe that they are happy- they already are! People who don't socialize much might not have as much of a need to make others feel like they are happy, though.\nIt's hard to say whether the statement is right or wrong, but there are different types of people. Let me just say that a lot of times, the superficial reality is different from the truth.	Society & Culture

question_title: who is Babylon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In ancient times, Babylon was a huge metropolitan city of the Sumerian empire.  It was located in modern day Iraq. It survived for thousands of years and was captured by Alexander the Great in 331 BC.  After Alexander's death 323 BC, Babylon soon fell into ruin.\n\nBabylon was a powerful symbol to ancient Jews and early Christians.  The book of Ezekiel describes the Babylonian siege and capture of the city of Jerusalem and the subsequent oppression of its Hebrew inhabitants.  Babylon has since been associated with sin, evil, and debauchery.  In the book of Revelation, Babylon is the name of either a city or a person from that city.  According to the book, this person ("the whore of Babylon") rules over the kings of the earth and rides upon a seven-headed beast. In one of the Bible's most famous cases of numerology, the beast is assigned the identifying number 666.\n\nThere is much debate amongst modern Christians as to who or what Babylon represents in Revelations.  Some scholars maintain that the Apostle John was talking about Emperor Nero of Rome.  Other popular interpretations include the Roman Catholic Church, the cities of San Francisco and New York, the Pope, the United Nations, and all "false" religions.\n\nIn Rastafarianism, Babylon represents the white power structure of colonial Jamaica.

question_title: What is the difference between Mahayana  and Theravada Buddhism? [SEP] question_content: It seems like there are a lot of flavors of Christianity, there are several fashions of Buddhist practices. \n\nWhich ones is best for our times? [SEP] best_answer: http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot02.htm  <<< differences on Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is the same: there is Theravada Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Yogacara Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism but it is all Buddhism and it all has the same taste - the taste of freedom. Buddhism has evolved into different forms so that it can be relevant to the different cultures in which it exists. It has been reinterpreted over the centuries so that it can remain relevant to each new generation. Outwardly, the types of Buddhism may seem very different but at the centre of all of them is the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. All major religions, Buddhism included, have split into schools and sects. But the different sects of Buddhism have never gone to war with each other and to this day, they go to each other's temples and worship together. Such tolerance and understanding is certainly rare. \n\nThe Buddha — the "Awakened One" — called the religion he founded Dhamma-vinaya — "the doctrine and discipline". To provide a social structure supportive of the practice of Dhamma-vinaya (or Dhamma for short [Sanskrit: Dharma]), and to preserve these teachings for posterity, the Buddha established the order of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns)— the Sangha — which continues to this day to pass his teachings on to subsequent generations of laypeople and monastics, alike. \nAs the Dhamma continued its spread across India after the Buddha's passing, differing interpretations of the original teachings arose, which led to schisms within the Sangha and the emergence of as many as eighteen distinct sects of Buddhism.One of these schools eventually gave rise to a reform movement that called itself Mahayana (the "Greater Vehicle") and that referred to the other schools disparagingly as Hinayana (the "Lesser Vehicle"). What we call Theravada today is the sole survivor of those early non-Mahayana schools. To avoid the pejorative tone implied by the terms Hinayana and Mahayana, it is common today to use more neutral language to distinguish between these two main branches of Buddhism. Because Theravada historically dominated southern Asia, it is sometimes called "Southern" Buddhism, while Mahayana, which migrated northwards from India into China, Tibet, Japan, and Korea, is known as "Northern" Buddhism.\n\nThe main branches:\n1. Theravada / Hinayana (The great tradition or the way of the elders)\n\n2. Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle" : Variants of Mahayana Buddhism:\n-Tibetan Buddhism\n-Zen Buddhism\n-Pure Land Buddhism\n-Nichiren Buddhism\n\nhttp://www.buddhanet.net/worlddir.htm  <<< world buddhist directory (you may want to go to a temple or monastry near you & make enquiries). \nIf for whatever reason Buddhism appeals to you, obviously a bit of reading cannot do any harm. You could try a few introductory books from any tradition to get a closer idea of what Buddhism can mean for you.\n- Try not to get confused with the various traditions: just go for what feels right and ideally do a course. Amazingly, it seems to me that at least 90% of the people stick to the tradition they started in - somehow karma seems to be at work there... Anyway, the biggest differences between the Buddhist traditions are usually more on the surface than in the ideas behind the appearances. Although for example in Zen you will find very little ritual etc., and in Tibetan Buddhism you may be overwhelmed by it, at the core of the practice are the same ideas, just different methods.\n- Once you decide to get involved with a specific tradition, make sure you are not dealing with a controversial/dubious teacher or school; although someone may wear Buddhist robes or calls him/herself a lama, guru or even Acharya, that does not make him or her a saint.... There are unfortunately a fair amount of questionable 'Buddhist' teachers and c	Society & Culture

question_title: I have a serious question about gambling and prayer? [SEP] question_content: I know that most answers will be gambling is a sin, but when ones financial need is great and prayer alone isn't helping, is it really so wrong to buy lottery tickets in hopes of helping out financially?  I guess my faith may be a little\nout of whack, right or wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Understand what gambling is and what prayer is.  Gambling is buying a minute chance to win money.  It is firt of all recreation, paying for the thrill of imagination of winning.  Odds are you wont win, but one can get some excitement out of playing with possibility--even a very small one.  Gamble for the thrill, for he excitement, for the tease of possibility.  Don't gamble to solve money problems.  I don't consider gambling a sin unless you attach unreasonable hope to it and neglect to make other responsible decisions.  \nPrayer is not a tool to manipulate God or providence or a substitute for making responsible decisions.   Unreasonable expectations of prayer can be just as destructive as unreasonable expectations of gambling.  Prayer is the act of conciously putting yourself in the presence of God and finding what God has for you to know and learn. God will give what God will give. I consider the assumption of adequate status to "bargain" with God unreasonable hubris and a detriment to spiritual growth.  \nPray and be open to new understandings of God and yourself.  Gamble if you can spare the money and enjoy the thrill.  (It's no worse than spending money on stuff you dont need.) But. . .dont look to eathre to solve problems tht God intended for you to confront with the wisdom and intelligence you were given.	Society & Culture

question_title: how do i know if a guy only is with me for sex? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well IT DEPENDS on what type of girl you are, or how you acted towards him. If you were too flirty, you were probably giving him the wrong impression. Guys go on first impressions, most of the time. If you were hard to get, and didn't do anything too fast, most likely, he's there because he sees something in you. You what you did, if you weren't too forward, you'll know what he's there for. If you were, he's there for sex. Most guys want sex anywayz, just tell him you don't. Lay down what you are in the relationship for, and tell him if he wants sex, he can leave rite now, because it'll be a WASTE OF Time.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Does he still love me? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months and we love each other like crazy. It was love at first sight. I mean every single day we would say how much we love each other at LEAST 15 times a day. I mean I love him.. i really do. just sometimes it seems like he doesnt love me.... maybe i'm mistaken. the thing is he lives 20 miles away.. so if something happens i wont know about it. i know he would never do anything like that but u know hes 17 and im 16... this guy loves me soo much he's cried for me. but lately we havent been saying i love you as much as we usually do... do you think anythings wrong? should i be worried? =&#92; [SEP] best_answer: Saying I love you isnt as powerful as showing it. If he is still treating you the same then you have nothing to worry about. One of the important things in a relationship is trust, if you dont have that then the relationship is doomed to end. Either you trust him and stay with him, or you dont and you move on.	Family & Relationships

Ask questions and snoop (kinda) "what the kinkiest thing you have done" or "whats the freakiest thing you would do or want to do" or  when your out at the mall somewhere and pat her but and see how she reacts... If she says OOOOOhhhh and kisses you then maybe its a good idea if you do it and she says what are doing and gives you a crazy look....

question_title: Do yo think we have the power to lower the gas prices? [SEP] question_content: It seem to me, if we organize our daily travels by eliminating those extra unplanned trips we would use less gas,(probably 2/3s less) which would cause the limited reserve storage supply to be over filled and cause that limited storage supply to become over filled and the oil companies would be forced to lower the prices in order to keep the supply moving. \n\nI think we have control. The oil companies are trying to make us think and feel that we don't have control. I believe we can cause the gas price to be what we want them to be by managing our travels (you know those "Oh,I forgot to" trips).   I don't want to pay more than .75 per gallon but, I can't do it alone. I need your help. I think by collectively managing our use of fuel we can make them know that supply and demand really controls price. This is just a different shift in the paradigm of thinking and acting.. Hey! we have control. Pass it on..  What do you think? Yes, I think we waste 2/3s and 1/4 of $3.00 per barrel is .75.

My mom flipped through the pictures and commented on my middle sisters hair looked how it was soo short, finished looking at the pictures without saying a word about me or my oldest sister who were also in the pictures and handed them back to me saying she needs to get back to her work. Their are other things that she will let my middle sister do that she wouldn't let my older sister or me do. [SEP] best_answer: no, i am sure that she doesnt hate you.\n\ni get the sense, however, that she is expecting soething from you with isnt fair for her to ask: she wants you to take a back seat to your siblings. i miagine that would be a very hard thing for anyone to do...\n\ni wish that i could give you some sort of magical advice that would fix your problem in one fell swoop, but we both know there is no such answer. the best that i can tell you is that you and your older sister both need to talk to your mother about they way that you feel.\n\nexplain it to her. allow her to ask questions, and maybe vent a little if she needs to. dont approach her with a accusatory manner, and dont give her the feeling she is being ganged up on. simply tell her the way that this treatment make the two of you feel, and i bet she will understand. however, just cuz she understands, does not mean that she will then fix the problem in one fell swoop.\n\nif the above doesnt work the only other advice i could give the two of you is to suck it up, and deal with it, and thank the Lord for what you do have, and for the good in your lives rather than the bad. sometimes people are so set in their ways that they cant even comprehend change, and i pray that mother isnt one of them.\n\nanyway, i wish you both the best of luck, and i hope that this helped you, even if only a little.\n                   \n                        :-)	Business & Finance

question_title: Is it possible to get a loan to purchase your first home if you have bad credit? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: FHA guarantees loans for first time home buyers and can often offer solutions even to people with bad credit.  Shopping around for a good realtor and lender if very important.\n\nAsk friends and family who they have used.  In the market as it currently sits, almost anyone can get a mortgage, everything depends on how much you want to pay and what property you want.\n\nWhen looking for homes, make sure your realtor knows that you are a first time home buyer and interested in FHA loans since only certain houses qualify for them and some will be automatically ruled out.\n\nWhen shopping for a lender (don't JUST go with the one the realtor recommends but DO at least check them out), inquire about FHA loans and what type of points and interest would be available for someone with a credit rating of X.  find out what your credit rating is from the 3 major credit bureaus BEFORE you shop for a lender.  You want to know what they are going to be seeing before they do.\n\nThe more information you have the better.  Don't be afraid to ask questions or to walk away if it isn't what you want.\n\nStandard disclaimer: This is not legal advice nor financial advice.

[SEP] best_answer: Fair for whom?  I'm afraid it's that nasty free-market capitalism thing.\n\nSure, you're making way less than you would be in the states.  But if it weren't cheaper to hire you, the company would save themselves the hassle and hire somebody local.\n\nThe only reason western companies hire people to do the jobs in undeveloped countries is that it costs them 100-1000 times less money.

question_title: Does the equator always face the sun? [SEP] question_content: Does the equator always face the sun?\nWhen the earth tilts on its axis, a majority of the sun is faced toward one hemisphere. (Thus creating Summer and Winter)\nSo therefore, the equator faces the sun, because the earth is tilted, and the earth must be faced at an angle. \nAm I right? [SEP] best_answer: The Sun, in its seasonal movement through the sky, passes directly over the equator twice each year on the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes, which occur in March and September (respectively). At the equator, the rays of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth on these dates.\n\nPlaces near the equator experience the quickest rates of sunrise and sunset in the world, taking minutes. Such places also have a relatively constant amount of day/night time on every day throughout the year compared with more northerly or southerly places.	Business & Finance

I know someone who applied to go to officer's candidate school, which may have different requirements than enlisting.  During the physical, they induced him with histamines and induced an asthma attack.  He was rejected when he had an attack.  I would ask a recruiter.  They will probably have you go through the physical and see how you fare and then make an individual determination.	Politics & Government

Whats the reuirements or whats the first step [SEP] best_answer: You might want ignore the ignorant comments about abusing power and start by looking for advertisements for job openings under law enforcement.  They often will state what the requirements are.  You could also try picking up an application.  Try scheduling a ride along with the local pd to see what it's like and if that might be the route you want to go.  It will also give you an opportunity to talk with the officer and they can provide you with a better idea of what you're getting into.  Best thing to do is talk to someone who's doing it.

question_title: what is facism? [SEP] question_content: i know kinda how it works but how does it work in the big picture? [SEP] best_answer: In the bigger picture when a country's economy is in danger tehn fascism comes to play. The equation is a bt complicated. It is generally beleived that a country is run by a govt but the capitalist lobbist and top officials are the actual show runners. In a situation when the industries of a country have gone into so much profit making that the general people on the streets have run out of purchasing power, political forces have to be bred that will divert the people away from analysing this. One of the proven solutions is to wage a war as that gets the military running and hiring and whatever problems people have, they shut up under the name of patriotism. Keep in mind the post war economy and the massive recruitment in the army for this. Sometimes before waging external wars redistribution of resources in the country solves the problem before a larger war. In effect rulers come up and resort to zenophobia or community pride or something similiar to whip up popular emotions. Thus jews resources were distributed and then in order to live the patriotism hitler waged war. This is how fascism works in the bigger picture.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is President Bush a really great president? [SEP] question_content: Tell me why you think our president is doing a great job, and deserves more credit than he gets.  \n\nGO BUSH !!!! [SEP] best_answer: How fickle people are, these polls out today are a joke. I would like to see this question posed...what don't you like about Bush, factually, not just off the cuff running your mouth...give me facts.\n\nIsn't it interesting that some 96% of the US population approved of the war in Iraq 4 years ago?  Yet, they don't approve now, sorry folks, you don't just change your mind about war in midstream.  It doesn't work that way.  We didn't have it easy during many wars, and didn't give up and pull out, eventually the tables turned and we were very successful.  I think of the Revolutionary war, WW1 and  WWII.  People seem to forget that we activly fought WWII for 4 years (after it was already in progress for 3 years).  It was awful, it was tough, but we got dragged into it by Japan, just like the terrorists draged us into this one.\n\nSo why is Bush great?  Number one, he has named his priorities and goals and stuck with them.  The economy is very strong, growing so fast the Feds can't raise interest rates fast enough.  I can't see what it is that Americans can blame Bush for when it comes to the economy, most of the damage was done by the terrorists on 9/11.  Bush said he belived in tax cuts, he didn't want new taxes and he wanted Americans to have more money in their pockets so they spent more.  All of the above happened.  I didn't see anyone complaining when they got their $300.00 a few years ago.  The democrats are dying to use taxes to lower the deficit...okay, that means our money folks, you okay with that?\nThere is a time a place for everything, raising taxes during war is not the way to go.\n\nWe have not had another attack on American soil.  If you want to keep the terrorists from attacking innocent Americans, send the military to the terrorists, keep them occupied and kick their asses somewhere else.  The men in the military are all for being out there kicking terrorism in the butt.  That is their job, they signed up for it and trained for it.  They don't just want Americans support they want success, that means letting them finish the job.  Some of these men and women are on their 4th and 5th tours, and wanting to go back for more.\n\nBush tells it like it is.  If he screws up he acknowledges it.  He doesn't mess around with anything.  He gets to the point and moves on.  You can tell how much he learned from his dad and President Regan.  Sometimes he so reminds me of Regan it's astonishing.  \n\nI'm sorry but when Hurricane Katrina came and Bush got the report on the dykes a few days before landfall..what was he going to do about them?  Send peple out to dump dirt on them?  It was too late to rebuild, it was not feasable to get everyone out of the City, hell that shouldn't even be the governments job to do that.  We have been through 3 direct Hurricane landfalls in 2 years where I live in Ft. Pierce, FL (not to mention the 4 indirect storms and depressions) and we took care of ourselves.  This is the land of the elderly.  If we had waited for the government we would have been standing in waist deep water for weeks.   Bush came and saw us, he gave us support, it's more emotional than anything else.  That is what we needed, when you dont' have TV, radio, phone, you feel very isolated.  Having your President come to see you is a great moral booster.  He is very good at that.\n\nBush has reached the point where he really doesn't care what everyone thinks about him.  He is out for doing what he thinks is best for America, not whats best for the social circle.  So if the other countries don't like it well, I'm sorry, but that is the way it is.  As soon as everyone begins to wake up and realize that we are all targets, we will be better off as a nation and a world.  If your President doesn't look after you first, then what good is he?  It's like having a dead beat dad...no thanks, I'll take GW!	Politics & Government

I sure do wish they wouldn't be so hard on fetuses and soft on terrorists. What a bunch of D-bags. [SEP] best_answer: It's not what they're smoking -- Libs just NEED to feel good about themselves.   I use to be a Democrat and somewhat liberal.  It made me feel good to be on the side of the party of the "common man."  It made me feel good to trash the "rich" Republicans.  It made me feel good to be for peace.  It made me feel good to be for equality.  It made me feel good to support social welfare programs.  Then I started reading and listening and thinking and I concluded that today's Democrats are not the Democrats that my parents and grandparents supported (and therefore I supported). They are more like Socialist who want the CENTRALIZED CONTROL OF AMERICA and a political-economic policy that boarders on communism.   The Socialist programs of the New Deal and The Great Society have failed for the most part and are destroying our country.  Now I am much more conservative, and a great deal worried.

IS THE BUSH FAMILY AN AMERICAN ENEMY ALSO?  THE FRIEND OF MY ENEMY IS NOT MY FRIEND. [SEP] best_answer: Because America's enemies are not Bush's enemies. Bush is oil, always has been, and always will be.  The oil industry transcends politics, because the money to be made in oil can literally make or break any countries economy.

[SEP] question_content: He has been left a certain percentage but his mother now wishes to be his guardian ad litern any one know what benefit this would be for him or her [SEP] best_answer: A guardian ad litem (GAL) is an independent attorney or guardian appointed by the court to ensure that the interests of a minor or an incompetent person are being fully protected in a legal proceeding.  The court will appoint a GAL regardless of the fact that the minor or incompetent (called a ward) may have already retained legal representation on his or her own.  This is to ensure the ward is not unduly influenced to make a decision which doesn't really benefit him or herself. It doesn't end the realtionship between your brother and hs current attorney.  \n\nOnce the legal proceeding concludes, the GAL usually ceases in this capacity.  \n\nNext time your brother appears in court, tell him to ask the judge why he or she is appointing a GAL.  The judge will be glad to explain the whole process and answer any of his questions.  His lawyer should be able to explain it in more detail as well.  That's what he's being paid for.

question_title: how much notice is a landlord required to give prior to entering an apartment according to North Carolina law? [SEP] question_content: my sister has an apartment in an upscale college complex, but recently came home to find that her apartment had been gone through, and they had found evidence of a pet on the property. They hung a "removal of pet" notice on her door. We understand that she was in breach of the contract, but we want to know if they unlawfully entered her apartment, and if there is anything we can do about it. She has a roommate that  doesnt actually live there, and sometimes this roommate's mother will come stay in her room, and we think that perhaps that is who complained about the pet. Her and the roommate do not get along. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I am not sure how N.C. law works exactly...but I can tell you how this would be resolved in Pa.  They probably aren;t that different regardless.  In Pa. a land lord is required to give 24 hours notice unless there is an emergency situation.  I do not see how a pet constitutes an emergency.  I'd also check your contract/lease, although I am sure that this is probably not listed.  As for the pet....your land lord has NO RIGHT to remove a pet of yours from the building.  None.  That is completely outrageous.  He can evict you for violating the lease.  He can ask you to remove the pet.  But he has absolutely no right at all to remove a pet from an apartment.  I'd sue.

question_title: do i have a fighting chance? [SEP] question_content: I just recieved a parking ticket for crosswalk obstruction.. my situation is that, the parking spot is between the crosswalk and a hydrant, the car is parked maybe about a foot over and into the crosswalk.. and my back is 2 inches into the yellow painting.. now the road was repaved just a little back and they moved the white crosswalk line BACK making the crosswalk wider and thus making the spot smaller.. \n\nsome more details.. my car is a '04 Toyota Matrix.. and is shorter than most sedans out there.. measuring only 171.30 in length.. compared to 189.20 for the '05 Camery..\n\nwould i be able to go to court, fight it, and be dismissed?.. or do i have to cough up the $105 to pay it off.. [SEP] best_answer: Go to court. Wear a suit.  You can win if the officer who wrote the ticket doesn't show up. \n\nIf they do, you then just explain the facts.  REHEARSE this many times, get the sequence down right so it's clear, don't talk about irrelevant matters such as paint quality, get comfortable with the facts so when you suddenly realize where you are it doesn't matter.  Think about their questions "But part of your car WAS outside the space?"  and your answer "Your Honor, my car is a Toyota, with a wheelbase of x inches. The average midsize has a y inch wheelbase.  The space in question is Z inches, and the average space is Q.  They created a space so small that few cars can legitimately fit into it, so they basically have set a trap for anyone that parks there without a tape measure." \n\nWorst case, you lose and pay the $105.

question_title: Why do people say the Dems. don't have a plan, or agenda? [SEP] question_content: I've heard more from tangible ideas from then than I have ever heard from the Repubs. \n\nDem plans I have heard:\n\n-Increasing the paltry min. wage.\n-Cutting student loan rates.\n-Re-examine the 9/11 commission\n-Health care for all under age 25\n-Working with other countries for more affordable prescription drugs\n-Rolling back the "rich" people's tax cuts\n\nSounds like a plan to me? What do you think?  Do you really think this will hurt America? \n\nWhat was the Repubs. plan?  What was going to be done for us, besides suppressing medical technology via stem cell banning or repressing individual autonomy by interfering w/ women's and gay rights? Enlighten me please!? [SEP] best_answer: I Can't enlighten you I am with you...\nWhat they are saying is...By saying Dems do not have a plan...\nDemocrats do not have a plan that Republicans support or care about...they will increasing minimum wagemakes businesses shut down and prices go up...Well really..Oregon has had an increased minumun wage and have grown jobs by 10%... They misinform because...they care not for the guy down the street and only care for the guy they shave with (themselves)...\n ELL ARTICULATED AND GREAT POINT..\nTK>>>>\nYou made a point that why let government fund something that is only theoretically helpful... As if  during Space Exploration  we are doing something except spending money...Why are you not up in arms about NASA...I guess getting TANG...makes it worth it for you....\n How about we take the Nasa money and spend it on finding cures...Oh  wait I know....You do not have a Disease...So who gives a damn right!!!!\n Also I read in a post who is going to pay for these programs...We for 3 years have been spending 10 million dollars an hour for a war of choice getting our heroes killed and occupying a middle eastern country...and Osama Bin Laden ...is not in that country...That is Amazing....and you never Scream..Who is paying for that war....You just keep guzzling Down the right wing Kool-aid....

question_title: Why does't America attack North Korea? [SEP] question_content: America attacked Iraq just because they possessed weapons of mass destruction.\nBut there were nothing. Then Bush have changed the reason of the war to liberating Iraqi from Saddam.\nAs you know, North Korea is making nuke weapons and Kim Jong-il oppresses people.\nActually many people has died from starvation.\nHow do you explain this kind of double standards. [SEP] best_answer: Well, considering that both North and South Korea still have their weapons aimed at each other, the window of opportunity just isn't there.  The terrain is god aweful, it's extremely cold and hot as hell.  The US forces alreay stationed there would take a huge hit and the capital of South Korea would cease to exist.  So lets hope no one gets too cavalier and lets diplomacy work things out.  If we're applauled by the loss of life with the war on terror, wait and see what happens if the Korean war resumes.  A little side not, the Korea's are technically still at war.  They have been under a cease fire for about fifty years, hence their weapons are still aimed at each other.	Politics & Government
question_title: Could we be headed for World War III? [SEP] question_content: I feel that we are? Maybe not this year or next or in 5, but soon. We are already over in Iraq, and then Iran and Korea are messing around with there nukes, and we (Americans) think that every country should have a democracy government.  Aren't we in away be the world dictator, or something. Give me your thoughts. [SEP] best_answer: I think we may be close.  But this time all the world needs to worry, because a nuclear war will wipe us out .	Politics & Government
