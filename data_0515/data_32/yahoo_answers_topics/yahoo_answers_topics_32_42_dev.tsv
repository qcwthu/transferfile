question_title: Is X Factor in danger of killing real music? [SEP] question_content: Is the industry in general stopping real talent emerging with its obsession for boy band covers and x factor style 'pop stars'? [SEP] best_answer: There have always been performers who don't write their own songs the only difference now is we get to see the selection process (all be it done in a more showbiz way). The only effect it might be having is the same as any reality tv show in as much as some young people today want instant fame without any of the hard work and see these shows as their chance to go to the Ivy and live the lifestyle that really doesn't exsist. It very rarely works out for these people.\n\nI think there will always be room for real talent and it will always be recognised (whether you write your own stuff or just perform other people's songs). These programmes are just a flash in the pan in terms of how the music business operates. They're this generation's must see telly, that's all. Real talent will always survive.	Entertainment & Music

I'd have rather seen Adam go. Or Parvati - she's one of those who can fly in under the radar and get to the end, and she's amazingly annoying.	Entertainment & Music

I consider him to have the most intriguing back story, of regretting his duty in the Republican Guard, and yet knowing it is part of him that can never leave him. Like all the other characters, he has a light and a dark side, however, acknowledging his dark side, almost blends it in with the light. In addition, he does show humanity towards the other survivors, as shown with trying to get the signal, his forgiveness of Ana-Lucia, and his speech to Charlie about the others.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Does anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? [SEP] question_content: I was watching the band Rush’s 30th anniversary concert last night on VH1 Classic. I’ve heard some of their songs as I was growing up. (“Limelight” is now one of my favorite Rush songs) They were performing their hit “Tom Sawyer”. I think the music is really good on this one too, but I started thinking about the lyrics.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? They are rather abstract but there has to be some meaning there. [SEP] best_answer: I think it's a song about a basic modern guy. His options are wide open, he's confident. He's got the world at his feet. He's a free thinker and his opinions can't be bought or sold. \n\nA modern day warrior\nMean, mean stride\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nMean, mean pride\n\nThough his mind is not for rent\nDon't put him down as arrogant\nHis reserve, a quiet defense\nRiding out the day's events\nThe river\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the mist, catch the myth\nCatch the mystery, catch the drift\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his skies are wide\n\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the space he invades\nHe gets by on you\n\nNo his mind is not for rent\nTo any god or government\nAlways hopeful, yet discontent\nHe knows changes aren't permanent\nBut change is\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the witness, catch the wit\nCatch the spirit, catch the spit\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his eyes are wide\n\nExit the warrior\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the energy you trade\nHe gets right on to the friction of the day	Entertainment & Music

question_title: What percentage of property value must a monthly rental payment be to make a rental investment worthwhile? 1%? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends greatly on where you are. If the property is in an area where real-estate is growing at 20% annually, then you can even pay people to stay in your place and make a nice return. However, if you expect the property to appreciate only 2% a year, then you will need to charge a lot more.\n\nWhat you need to do is figure out what your annual costs are (cost of capital, taxes, insurance, maintanence, etc) then subtract how much you think the property will appreciate in that year, and the difference will be the minimum you could charge for yearly rent to simply break even (divide by twelve for monthly). To that, add whatever amount you feel the market would bear to provide profit and cover any eventual risks or times of vacancies.	Business & Finance

question_title: In a corporation, what's the difference between a president, a secretarty, a CEO, and an owner? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the corporation.  The CEO is typically above the President of an organization, usually works with the Board of Directors.  A secretary is typically very far down an organizationla list, and aides the white and blue collar workers in their tasks.  (some firms use the term Secretary instead of Vice President, but this is rare).  For a corporation, the owner is not a single person, but several people.  When you hear about a person having stock in a company, that person essentially 'owns' a piece of the company.  So the owners are a primary source of financing for the corporation because they supply the money (through stocks), but owners have actually very little to do with the day-to-day operations of the firm.

question_title: did you participate in boycott yesterday Walmart from donating a large amount of money to the gay community? [SEP] question_content: What i dont understand why do business have to give money to these groups at ths same time they wont pay their employees better. Its kinda like blackmail ,this is the kind of crap thats hurting this country. If you belong to a certain group you should be able to support it yourself if you believe in that much.Thats what my religion does.There are many familes that cant make ends meet they have children without medical insurance & companies give to a community that knows very little about providing for their family its all about me me me !! [SEP] best_answer: Actually the money goes into funding to generate awareness and acceptance(ie commercials and public speakers)I feel that if a buisness wants to set up a booth or donation box for any reason that is their porogative they dont tell you that you have to put money in its your choice.  I do believe tolorence in any form wether it be for gay, violence, or even religious tolerence is and should still be supported and every religion has some sort of donation system and some of that comes from other odinary people that are not apart of your congregation ie garage sales with donation boxes. so get off your high horse and just because you dont like gays does not mean you should condemn the world to your beliefs.

[SEP] best_answer: If you have a bank account-depending how long you've had it and if you have a job(employment) go to the same bank and apply for the loan.  Since this is a small amount and you can afford payments of approx 100. per month--maybe less but only the Loan Officer at your bank can tell you-that is your best bet to get the loan and  you're also establishing good solid credit by paying off a bank loan. Whatever you do-do not get the loan from anyone where you'll have a high finance charge.  Talk to your bank and even if for some reason they can't they can advise if you can get loan and what to avoid doing--if you've applied bring proof and show to bank officer, bring all paperwork that shows you're here legally.

[SEP] best_answer: Medical school in the US is four years beyond college. The last two years have you getting practical clinical experience, cycling among different specialties such as surgery, ob/gyn, pediatrics, psychiatry, emergency medicine, etc. \n\nAfter medical school, pretty much all doctors go through some combination of internship/residency for about five years, depending on the program. During this time, you are working very hard, sometimes for 24 or 36-hour shifts while you are on call, and you are paid about US$30,000 year. \n\nAfter that, you're a regular old doctor, whose specialty might be General Practice, or you might choose another specialty.

question_title: what is cost production? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the belief that the value of an object is decided by the resources that went into making it. The cost can be composed of any of the factors of production including labour, capital, land, or technology.\n\nTwo of the most common cost-of-production theories are the medieval just price theory and the classical labor theory of value. The labor theory of value, which interprets labor-value as the determinant of prices, was first developed by Adam Smith and later expanded by David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Most classical economists (as well as nearly all Marxists) subscribe to it. However, Marx's theory is not a true cost-of-production theory since the value of a commodity contains a component of surplus value unrelated to the physical cost of producing it. The magnitude of this surplus value may be unrelated to production-costs. A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the "neo-Ricardian school" of Piero Sraffa and his followers.\n\nThe most common counterpoint to this is the marginal theory of value which asserts that economic value is set by the consumer's marginal utility. This is the view most commonly held by the majority of contemporary mainstream economists.	Education & Reference

question_title: Describe the chief features of the Shore Temples at Mahabalipuram? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mahabalipuram is a temple town situated along the shores of the Bay of Bengal in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The sheer sculptural extravaganza of the rock-cut temples is not only reflective of the artistic tastes of the erstwhile Pallava rulers: the temples are also regarded as the birthplace of an entirely new style of architecture, which came to be known as the South Indian temple architecture. \nMahabalipuram art can be divided into four categories : open air bas - relief, structured temples, man-made caves and rathas ('chariots' carved from single boulders, to resemble temples or chariots used in temple processions). The famous Arjuna's Penance and the Krishna Mandapa, adorn massive rocks near the centre of the village. The beautiful Shore Temple towers over the waves, behind a protective breakwater. Sixteen man-made caves in different stages of completion are also seen, scattered through the area.\n\nMahabalipuram is about 60 Kms. south of the city of Madras, in Tamil Nadu. Mahabalipuram, or Mamallapuram, was the chief seaport of the Pallavas who ruled over much of South India from as early as the first century B.C to the eighth century A.D., and it is now recognized as the site of some of the greatest architectural and sculptural achievements in India. \n\nTemples of Mahabalipuram\n\nCave Temples were excavated by scooping out the scarp of the hill. The scooping work starts from front to back. The cave temple is usually divided into inner & outer mandapas, distinguished by the difference in levels. The front mandapa will have pillars & plasters numbering 4,6,8,10. The inner mandapa contains single, triple or five cells. The cave temple with little modification is categorized as Mamalla style. The pillars under this style are slender & taller with squatting lion at their base. The pillar is divided into distinct parts known as kalasa, tadi, kumba, padma etc. \n\nMonolithic Temples are locally known as Rathas. They were executed by chiseling out the exterior face of the boulder. Work started from top to bottom. The pyramidal vimana with sikhara at the top is an important feature of this style. It can be rightly said that these monolithic temples must have paved the way for the structural temples with elaborate architectural & sculptural details in the subsequent stage. There a total number of 8 monolithic temples found in Mamallapuram. The five rathas in one place, Ganesha Ratha, Valayankuttai Ratha & Pidari Rathas.\n\nFive Rathas\nA small hill sloping from south to north has been segmented into five divisions & converted into monolithic temples. The heights of the segments have been cleverly used for temples with single tier to three-tiered vimana. Each monolithic temples shows different kind of sikhara. The five rathas are Dharmaraja Ratha, Bhima Ratha, Arjuna Ratha, Draupadi Ratha and Nakul Sahadev Ratha. \n\nShore Temple\n\nThe Shore Temple on the Bay of Bengal was constructed in the 7th century during the rule of King Narsimha-Varman II Rajasimha (c. 690-728).The Shore temples is a temple complex consisting of two Siva temples and a carving of Anantasayana Vishnu. \nThe temple facing east is entered by a small gopura. On plan, it consists of a small sanctum & a front mandapa & is a two-tired vimana. The sanctum is housing a linga. The Somaskanda panel consisting of Siva & Parvati with baby Skanda is on the back wall of the sanctum. The dhara linga & Somaskanda panel on the back wall of the sanctum are the features of the Pallava temples only. \nThe temple facing west is also dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is large in plan comprising sanctum, mahamandapa, front mandapa, balipitha and dvajastamba. The temple’s vimana is four tiered with octagonal sikhara. It is important to note that stupis of both these temples are not covered by kalasa (copper finials).\nThe carving on Lord Vishnu on a boulder in Anantasayana form is lying in between these two temples. It belongs \nto the period of Narasimhava	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: I'm still trying to figure out which of 2 universities I want to attend. I've accepted both until I figure it out. Are there any bad consequences for me when I inform one of them? [SEP] best_answer: Um, depends on what paperwork you've signed so far. For some universities, an acceptance (that is, mailing back in the form that says "yes, I'm coming") constitutes a binding contract and you'll be required to pay a deposit to the school or they can take legal action. For others, this is not true. So read over the form you signed carefully to make sure you're not committing to anything financially before you try this strategy. \n\nA better way might be just calling the department of admissions at both universities. Often if you talk to someone face to face, they can give you an extension on the deadlines for acceptances if you've got a good reason to need it.	Education & Reference

But, I'm right-handed people and want to switch to left -handed people? Is it okay? And what's your suggest to make it easier... [SEP] best_answer: Your teacher was probably referring to ambidextrous people (im able to write, do anything actually with both hands, legs etc.) true ambidextrous people, not people that teach themselves how to do it think differently to just right handed or left handed people. Apparently i can switch my thinking to either side of my brain, over all i tend to have a "center" of thinking.  i can also read backwards and write backwards or with both hands at the same time without even thinking about it. I discovered this when i was a teenager, all my friends thought it was awesome and tried to do it! i thought it was so funny because they were all trying so hard when i didnt even have to think when i did it! \nI'm not sure if im smarter then other people, maybe i am lol! i did always get great marks in school so yer, but there are disadvantages-always have had trouble working out left from right, learning languages, trouble with figures/maths in general. All of those disadvantages are proven.\n\nYou cannot make yourself be left handed or ambidextrous and get the positives with it-like being intelligent (so they say).\nSo dont try to be, you cannot change how your brain works. \nHope this helped.

[SEP] question_content: I have been looking and looking for the answers to these two questions: when and where was hepatitis b discovered. if you can b the first (or only) to tell me and give me your source i will choose you as best answer. i am presenting this for bio tomorro and i really could use the help. Thankx. [SEP] best_answer: Hepatitis B: A Brief History:\n\nIn 1965, Dr. Blumberg who was studying haemophilia, found an antibody in two patients which reacted against an antigen from an Australian Aborigine. Later the antigen was found in patients with serum type hepatitis and was initially designated "Australian Antigen". Subsequent study has shown the Australia Antigen to be the hepatitis B surface antigen. Dr. Blumberg was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Initially there appeared to be three particles associated with hepatitis B infection: a large "complete" particle called the "Dane particle", a small circular 20nm particle and an oblong 40nm particle. Further research identified the Dane particle as the hepatitis B viron and the other two particles as excess surface protein. This former terminology is no longer used and the virus is referred to according to its structure.	Health

question_title: bleeding mid cycle on the pill.? [SEP] question_content: i had my period about a week ago but today i have started bleeding again with mild cramps. im on the pill and have been for three years. i missed a pill and had unprotected sex with my husband. iv never had bleeding mid cycle before even when i first stared the pill i never got it. so whats happening. i have made an opointment for the doc on monday but it doesnt stop me worrying now.\nany advise?\nam i pregnant? or ill?\nplease help. [SEP] best_answer: More than likely you are spotting/ break through bleeding because you missed a pill or took one late. Did you make up the missed pill? You should always take all of the pills in your pill pack regardless of any bleeding. As soon as you realize that you missed a pill take it and stay on schedule with the rest of your pill pack. Not doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your pills. Also, these may not be the best pills for you, tell your doctor what symptoms you are having and they can determine a better pill for you. If you have stopped taking your pills or didn't make up the missed pills you would be wise to use condoms until you see your doctor and are told otherwise.	Health
question_title: Should I be worried about a swollen gum? [SEP] question_content: The gum in between one of my teeth has been swollen and red for about a week now.  I have a crown right next to it that I had put in two years ago.  It is painful but not unbearable.  I was just wondering if I should be worried.  I have used salt water and listerine every day now and it is not helping.  I don't have insurance and can't afford to go see a dentist if it is something normal. [SEP] best_answer: SWOLLEN GUMS IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE OR NORMAL.  let the nurse stick with nursing.  maybe salt water has miracle properties at the hospital but in your mouth it does nothing.  go to the dentist immediately.  if you wait you might end up in the ER with a serious infection and then the dentist after that anyway.  talk about expensive.  don't wait til it's something serious and you lose a tooth.

question_title: Can using a vibrator make you loose your virginity? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It would depend on how it was used.

question_title: Weight loss with an injury? [SEP] question_content: I have a very bad ankle that needs surgery.  I also need to loose about 30lbs.  What kind of exercises can I do to loose weight AND not add more pain or injury to that ankle?  Walking and running are out of the picture entirely.\n\nserious replys only please [SEP] best_answer: SWIM SWIM SWIM. The best excercise in the world. Swimming is totally weightless and it works a series of ways. It is Aerobic and resistance training in one. Aerobic works to get your heart rate going and thus will increase metabolism and help circulation which all burn fat. Also if you are swimming and not doing a stationary type of water work out then your breathing becomes regulated by the type of stroke you are swimming. Resistance training is from the water friction. Every step and stroke you make is like having a few pounds on your hand. Resistance and light weight training is important when losing weight because you have to tighten the skin as well. Good luck, it will change your life when you lose the weight, but make sure you do it right.	Health
question_title: How can I get my abs.? [SEP] question_content: How can I get my abs 100% strong? what should I eat and dont, work outs, and for how long or how many, advice and explain why?\n\nI drink alot of coke and eat alot of fast food. [SEP] best_answer: well you seem to know that drinking soda and eating fast food is not good for getting a six pack.  Running 3-5 times a week is the best way to burn stomach fat.  Doing situps and crunches just strengthens the muscles.  In order to start seeing a hard stomach you need to burn away the fat around it.  I suggest eating high protein low fat meals and if you still eat fast food try eating a salad instead of a burger or even a grilled chicken without mayo. It's all about choices and your dedication to your health. Good luck!	Health

question_title: What diagnosis include the symptoms sore throat, nasal congestion, drooling, anorexia, and abdominal pain? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: the combination of drooling and anorexia are the most significant among what you mentioned because they clearly point to an inability to swallow (so severe that swallowing even saliva is not possible hence the drooling), this could be a result of any one of serious conditions :\n\n1-epiglottitis (a potentially lethal condition)\n\n2-upper esophagitis (also potentially dangerous if infection spreads to mediastinum)\n\n3-neurological disease (bulbar palsy) causing the inability to swallow (when there is no pain)\n\n4-SEVERE TONSILLITIS(though mentioned  last, this is the most likely one, according to your description . i put the others first because they are the most dangerous ones.)\n\ni think its best to let a doctor check you .(especially if you are describing the symptoms of a CHILD )	Health

question_title: Can slim fast help me to lose 50lbs in 8 months if i stick to it? [SEP] question_content: Including that i do 20-30 mins of cardio 3 times a week? [SEP] best_answer: It is better to go on a diet with real food than slim fast.  Slim fast is hard to stick with because your body needs the chewing action.  \n\nIf you contact me with your email address, I will gladly give you a diet based on Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem. You can do it yourself at home. You won't need to measure anything or count calories. It is all already proportioned. It involves all food groups and is based on 1250 calories. Very healthy.  I have shared it with many askers on yahoo answers.	Health

As far as I am concerned, there is no perfect individual in this world because all have flaws in their personality. You couldn't find a perfect man BUT you could possibly find the BEST.

[SEP] best_answer: you may need to knee him in the groin area as you're telling him you're not interested. technically, it's not assault. it would be considered harrassment if you had already told him you're not interested before, therefore you would be defending yourself :O)	Family & Relationships

Take in what they are talking about and the way they discuss things. This will give you plenty of clues as to what they want to talk about and how they expect people who are speaking to them to talk about those things. Once you are familiar with all of this, then learn something about any subjects they talk about that you don't know much about, so that you can carry on a decent conversation.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Why is Ads by google everywhere? I hate it? [SEP] question_content: I'm beginning to hate google. Why is it that all sites are annoyingly congested with google adverts that instead of finding rich content you see google adverts everywhere? Is google paying the site owners for displaying adverts on their sites? How does the whole thing works? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, on most sites, ads are the major source of income.  They are slots sold by the webhost (google in our case) to another company (our example AD)\n\nYou're surfing on Google, hypothetically, and you come accross an annoying AD.  you might click on it on accident, you may ignore it, or you may be intrigued and click on it for more information.  Google is happy any way, because they get money for allowing others to put their information on the Google site.  The company is happy if the first or last happen.  If the first happens they get another "Hit" which shows how many times the site has been visited, increasing rankings/popularity/etc. the third, they get an additional Hit, but they also run the chance of selling something/getting another Hit on a linked site.\n\nSo you see, Ads are needed for a site to run, on both ends.  Its like a helpful parasite, it lives on the Host, but helps it, and the host helps the parasite at the same time	Computers & Internet

This statement works fine for me in my code; this is not where the problem lies.\n\nNext, I evaluate whether that string is equivalent to a string literal in an IF statement.\n\nexample:\nif (strStringName == "ab")\n{\n    (this doesn't work, blah blah blah)\n}\n\nFor some reason, this IF statement evaluates the express as "false"...which it shouldn't do!\n\nHowever, if I use the charAt method, it works...but it sure is a lot of added code I have to write which I shouldn't have to.\n\nexample:\nif (strStringName.charAt(0) == 'a' && strStringName.charAt(1) == 'b')\n{\n    (this works, blah blah blah)\n}\n\nwtf is going on??!!!!...is it a bug with the SDK/JDK?...bleh! [SEP] best_answer: use if (string1.equals(string2)) not if (string1 == string2), because the first one looks to see if the strings have the same content, the second one looks to see if the strings share the same memory location.

[SEP] best_answer: Web pages are mostly written in HTML.  If you want pages to accept data or do cool things like show picture slide shows you can use javascript.  Now if you want to create truely dynamic web pages that people can log in at, extract data, or search for things you'll want to use PHP.  To search you'll need a database to store info in which case you can use SQL, one such implementation is MySQL.  \n\nThese are all FREE!  There are pleanty of resources on the net to teach you.  So just search on their names and you will get plenty to keep you busy.\n\nThere are more, but this is a very popular group of software commonly known as LAMP.  Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. \n\nWhen you get all that working you can create super fancy stuff using FLASH from Adobe-Macromedia.  That one will cost ya.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How is yahoo answers, differant then a chat room? [SEP] question_content: I only been in a chat room a few time, so I don't really remember, but isen't yahoo answers close to a chat room ? [SEP] best_answer: It is not intended to be a chat room at all, nor does it follow a similar format.\n\nA chat room offers a way for people to interact real time.  Mostly about nonsense, sometimes about something in particular.  Again, people are communicating real time, back and forth.\n\nYahoo! Answers offers people a way to ask a question, and solicit feedback from other participants.  It is not real time, and there is little immediate interaction.  It is not intended to be used as a method of direct communication---It is meant to pose questions and share answers.\n\nAs mentioned in Yahoo's own description, the topics can be from the silly to the serious, just like a chat room, but it's not a way to communicate like a chat room.

(stamina, muscles, and speed.)\nTHANKS A LOT   :) [SEP] best_answer: Run. Alot. I run track and it helps immensely on the court. Just think, you run a couple miles everyday, then in a game, you run maybe, say, 1/4 mile. You'll be great. You'll beat your man up the floor everytime! And shoot alot too. Work on defensive drills as well as offensive. This may sound weird, but try taking tap dancing lessons. I know that sounds extremely odd but, the coaches recomd it because it makes for faster foot movement. Also, get in the gym alot, get a liftng plan going. Check it out. See if that works.

question_title: When shooting a fire arm how come the rekasha never hit the shooter? [SEP] question_content: i was wonder because on this tv show the were shoooting and it bbounced back and hit the car not the shooter how so [SEP] best_answer: The bullet would have to strike something that would cause the bullet to bounce straight back in order for the shooter to be hit. Normally the bullet will strike something at an angle. When the bullet hits, the object it hits absorbs energy from the bullet. The greater the angle, the less energy is absorbed. Example, if you are shooting across water, the bullet might strike at a 175 degree angle, little energy is absorbed by the water and the bullet will travel very far after hitting the water. If the bullet strikes pavement at 45 degrees, half of the energy will be absorbed by the pavement, and will not travel much farther after hitting the pavement. If the bullet hits a concrete wall at 90 degrees, all of the energy is absorbed by the wall, the bullet has no energy left to ricochet back to the shooter. If the wall were made of rubber, the wall would absorb all of the energy, but because of the elastic properties of rubber, the rubber would transfer some of the energy back to the bullet, and throw the bullet back to the shooter. Hope this helps.	Sports

question_title: Best national anthem? [SEP] question_content: Which national anthem is the most rousing before a football match? For me, France's is spine-tingling.. [SEP] best_answer: I believe that Mexico's national anthem is very pretty, the music is very strong and the lyrics are very bold and patriotic, a military march composed in the 19th century and the history says used for the first time during the war with the US... The Anthem was composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra and the music was arranged by Jaime Nunó.\nFrance is a classic, also (like Mexico's) a military march, full of feeling and history.. \nUSA's is pretty but not that strong, i feel it more like romatic, but obviously is not a march. I do not know its history, but the lyrcs are very sentimental. That is way it sounds so pretty when it is singed "a capella". \nJust like Germany's hymn from Haydn. the issue with the verses i think its somehow stupid, that had nothing to do with the WWII, I like the lyrics but the music is very pretty and i think its motto Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit represents totally what Germany is today.\n \nAnd the very best is the Hymn of Europa: The tune of the Ode to Joy  (Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and the lyrics are from Friedrich Schiller)	Sports

Lean forward as if you were hurdling grab hold of a fence, wall, or another hurdle. Place you lead leg beside hurdle and snap your trail leg over the hurdle.\n* First, the hurdles must be brought in closer. Shorten the distance between the first and second hurdle so that you can 3 step without bounding.\n* Use your feet to walk off the distance you moved the hurdle from the original marks, now walk off the same distance for all of the other hurdles.\n* Run these in practic till in feel like you are getting too close to the next hurdle then move all the hurdles a step forward.\n* The transition takes time, do not force the 3 step, so "just run" go over the hurdle with what ever leg comes up. Eventually 3 stepping will occur by itself. \n\n\n 300-400M Hurdles running drills\n\nFirst 6:  - The first six hurdles are setup on the marks. The first six hurdle are then ran at race pace to build rhythm.\nRun 5 to 7 of these to build rhythm and strength.\n\n Last 3:  \n- The last three hurdles are setup on the marks, used for 300 hurdle training to build strength.\nRun 3 to 5 of these to build strength.

Keep them locked up for years.\n\n(2)  China also harvests the organs of political prisoners (there are reports they are simply killed for the organs).\n\n(3)  Think of the extreme governments around the world that hold their women to sub-servient roles, denying them education or career advancement.\n\n(4)  Despotic tribal governments which are conducting acts of genocide on refugee camps, or their own people fleeing the destruction of their own villages.\n\nYou read about this, and you often think, "Didn't this happen in the Dark Ages?"

question_title: probation violation? [SEP] question_content: I have been convicted of 2 DUI's, I was sentenced to 90 days house arrest and 2 years probation. After my house arrest was done. I was seen in a local bar by a probation officer. I met with my probation officer, she made me see the light. I felt it was over. Now I get a letter, 6 weeks later, that I have to go to a hearing for probation revocation. What should I expect to happen? I have no other charges, have not been in trouble. And when I am tested for alcohol I am clean [SEP] best_answer: It is likely that you have a probation term that requires you to not be in a place where alcohol is the primary item sold (such as a bar or liquor store).  Where I work, that is a VERY common term amongst probationers whose probation is due to alcohol charges.  If your probation officer is on your side, now is probably a good time to get in their and sell your case to him or her.  You will need them on your side when you go to court.\n\nIt is likely that a term of your probation included a suspended jail or prison term (jail time that you will have to serve if you mess up on probation) - almost all probation does.  If so, you may be looking at jail or prison time.	Politics & Government

I wish the UK were closer to North America so it could be a natural trading partner of NAFTA rather than the EU.  The military alliance between the UK and US is very strong; would that we could have the same relationship vis a vis trade.  (The "EU Citizens" and "All Others" lines at British airports make me cringe: When I visit the UK, I'd like to have the same legal status a Frenchman or Pole has, rather than being lumped in with the Mongolians and "all others.")  \n\n I've long maintained that the US would be a nicer nation if it had been a British territory for about another hundred years, the way Canada was.  We'd have gotten rid of slavery a lot sooner, might have been able to avoid the Civil War and might have gotten industrialized a little faster if we'd had direct British influence.  \n\n In establishing Rhodes Scholarships, Cecil Rhodes hoped to draw the US into the British Commonwealth by exposing the cream of US academia to Oxford.

I have asked for this to be re-calculated and be more in line with the standard rate.  How does the IRS come up with their figure?  Is it only cost of gas on a national average? Does it include wear and tear on the vehicle, tires etc.. [SEP] best_answer: IR-2005-99, Sept. 9, 2005\n\nWASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department announced an increase to the optional standard mileage rates for the final four months of 2005.\n\nThe rate will increase to 48.5 cents a mile for all business miles driven between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 2005. This is an increase of 8 cents from the 40.5 cent rate in effect for the first eight months of 2005, as set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-64.\n\n<edit>\n\nWhile gasoline is a major factor in the mileage figure, other items enter into the calculation of mileage rates, such as the price of new vehicles and insurance.\n\nThe optional business standard mileage rate is used to compute the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business use in lieu of the extra burden of tracking actual costs. This rate is also used as a benchmark by the federal government and many businesses to reimburse their employees for mileage.	Politics & Government

The only difference i see is that, our air strikes damage the buildings so Big Haluburton can rebuild them for a modest fee.

question_title: Is carbon dating appropriate for measuring the age of materials that are a few years old? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No. Radiocarbon dating relys on Carbon 14 which has a half-life of 5730±40 years. Most answers for carbon dating give a range of 100-200 years over when a sample might be from.\n\nIn addition to the half-life, you also need to know something about where the carbon in the sample came from, because different sources have different starting amounts of C14. \n\nThis means that carbon dating something modern would tell you it was made in the last 100 years. You could probably get a better estimate of the age, just by looking at it.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: A curve in a highway has a radius of 120m and is banked at 2.50 degrees.? [SEP] question_content: On an icy road, what is the safest speed to around the curve [SEP] best_answer: To stay on the road with no slip the vector of total force on a car F must be strictly normal to the bank with b=2.5 degrees. Vector F=Fx+Fy, Fy=m*g being the weight of the car, Fx=m*a=m*r*w^2 is centripetal force on the curve of r=120m, w=v/r is angular speed, v is linear speed, a=r*w^2 is centripetal acceleration. On the other hand as Fx=F*sin(b) & Fy=F*cos(b) or Fx/Fy=tg(b) or [m*r*(v/r)^2]/[m*g]=tg(b), hence v=sqrt(g*tg(b)*r)=7.17m/s=25.81 km/h. Hi to SS!	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: The concept of a time machine could exist, but it would take an almost infinite amount of energy.  The only way it could work is exactly the way you are asking,  You can only move forward in time, just at different rates.  So if you want to see the future then time would need to slow down for you and the world would have to speed up.  After a while you could return to earth and it would be the future.  \nFrom what is presently known about physics you can only move forward in time only at different rates from an observers point of view.  Believe me if we could travel back in time someone would have already screwed it up something big by now.\n\nThis is a one way trip, good luck	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How would your kidneys maintain the water and mineral balance of your blood on...? [SEP] question_content: a) a cool day when you stayed inside and drank lots of tea?\nor\nb) a hot sports day when you ran three races and had forgotten your water bottle?\n\nplease help! [SEP] best_answer: The kidneys are always trying to maintain homeostasis - keeping the water to mineral ratio in your blood constant.\n\nIf you stayed inside and drank lots of tea, you will have a big increase in water in your blood, while the amount of minerals stays the same. Your kidneys would then remove lots of water from your blood and keep the minerals, to return the concentration of minerals back to normal. (You'll urinate a lot)\n\nIf you used up a lot of your body's water by sweating and then not replenishing it, the mineral concentration would be much higher. The kidneys will try to return the concentration back to normal by letting out a lot of minerals but not a lot of water (You won't urinate as much, and when you do, it will be very concentrated)	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: 1) You can't change a past event, that's nescessary for you to be able to change that past event. (You can't kill your distant ancestor)\n2) You can't go experience a future event, that requires someone from that future event to change your present event. (In the 'Planet of the Apes' movie series, Caesar went back to his past, and started an ape rebelion that built the world that Charleton Heston visited when he went into his future)\n\nBut how would you know?

question_title: what creates a black hole? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When a star runs out of fuel, it explodes its outer layer off in a Nova, while the core collapses inwards. Because the continual fusion reaction has stopped, there's nothing to stop the collapse until all of the residual matter presses against each other. This is called a Brown Dwarf.\nIf the star is much larger than our Sun, gravity is so strong that even the matter collapses until the atoms' neucleii press against each other. This is called a Neutron Star.\nIf the star is still larger, not even the neutrons stop the collapse, and gravity causes the whole lot to collapse to a pinpoint. The gravity is still there, sucking in everything around it, even light. This is called a Black Hole.	Science & Mathematics

Since we use sulfuric acid we also add 8 sulfat-ions on both sides and hereby can neutralize the product side:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                         2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH\n\n3) STOCHIOMETRIC BALANCE OF THE ELEMENTS H and O\n\nTaking into consideration that unused protons finally end up as water, we add on the right side 11 H2O and hereby is also reached the balance of oxigen:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                  2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH + 11 H2O\n\nSo now good luck for counting the atoms!

question_title: Compare and contrast index refraction and optical density? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the velocity of light in free space to that in the material.\n\nThe speed of light in free space is the maximum value. Therefore the speed of light in any medium is always less than that of the speed of light in free space.\n\nTherefore refractive index of any material is always greater than one.\n\nIn a given material the refractive index changes for change of frequency of the light wave. The refractive index of violet (High frequency) light will be more than that of red (Low frequency) light.\n\nThe refractive index of a material is greater implies that the speed of light in it will be less. We call this material as optically denser than the material for which the refractive index is less. \n\nFor the same material the density varies with temperature and generally when the density increases the refractive index also increases.

It occupies one city block (remember that there is a lot of plaza space around the building, so the block is larger than 225 ft square).  Of course, most skyscrapers are considerably smaller than this.  Most city blocks are about 300 ft square, give or take 50 feet (it, of course, depends on the city).	Science & Mathematics

WWJD?'\n\nThat's what Santy Clause Christmas is to me.\n\nWHat is it to you? :-) [SEP] best_answer: have you heard the phrase "charity begins at Home" it is not about gifts that we do not need, or the expense of the gifts, I grew up in a single parent home with a tight budget, my mother worked a manual labor job to support 4 kids.

I am not rich but I am proud to be a western Christian.\nand what I give to charity is not anybodies business but mine and God.	Society & Culture

question_title: is Pimsleur level 1 lesson cds worth $274? [SEP] question_content: Was wondering if it is worth it.  I have the 8 lesson one that they sell in stores and it have seem to work pretty well.   But I wondering if anyone has bought the level 1 box online and wether its just as good as the first 8 lessons? [SEP] best_answer: The Pimsleur program is very good. I purchased the Pimsleur Portuguese I program and I thought it was extremely helpful in learning the basics of speaking Portuguese. However, it will not teach you how to write or read it. If you want to learn how to read and write then maybe you can try my approach. Once you have completed the entire program, all 30 lessons, get a dictionary in your target language and start from the very beginning of the program and look up all of the words you hear in the dictionary. Additionally, in order to do verb conjugations, go to the Dictionary.com website, type in the English and have it translate the phrase into the language of your choice. (Ex: I am, You are, He is, She is, We are, They are) Furthermore, write all of this information down in a notebook and review daily. That's what has worked for me so far.	Society & Culture

question_title: If the Jehovahs Witness people believe that 144,000 people ...? [SEP] question_content: can get into heaven...\nWhy are the recruiting? Kinda narrows their own chances doesnt it? [SEP] best_answer: No,it doesn't.Because the Bible doesn't teach that heaven is home to everyone that is good.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 faithful men and women will be reigning in heaven as kings and priests with Christ because that is what the Bible teaches.(Rev.14:1-4)\nThe rest of obedient mankind has the hope of eternal life on earth.This was God's original plan for man.He created the earth for humans.He put the first human pair there,told them to multiply and fill the earth.They were created perfect and designed to live forever.If it wasn't for their rebellion and disobedience,they would still be alive today and we wouldn't all be suffering the effects of their disobedience.It is because of their sinning against Jehovah that they have passed onto all mankind imperfection,sin and death.\nIn God's due time,he will by means of Christ Jesus wage war against this wicked system and only righteous ones will survive.Then God's purpose will finally be fulfilled.The earth will be filled with righteous followers of Jehovah God.The earth will be restored to its original paradise conditions and man will be blessed with eternal life.\nThis is why Jehovah's Witnesses obey Jesus' command to 'go therefore and make disciples.....teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you'(Matt28:19,20),because by our obedience we hopefully will be part of that wonderful new righteous system with eternal blessings in store.\nPs.37:9-11,29;Pr.2:21;\nDan.2:44;Rev.21:3,4	Society & Culture

question_title: I am confused by the term, "resort dressy".? [SEP] question_content: I need to know for a business function coming up in a few days. \n\nI do know that "resort dressy" does not mean the same thing as "black tie". Therefore, I do know not to wear an evening gown as that would be considered "black tie" attire. \n\nWhat I need to know is, what does the term "resort dressy" mean in terms of the items one might pick to wear to such an event. \n\nThe event is a dinner/dance/award ceremony but is specified to be "resort dressy". So, should I take a nice sundress and sandals or dressy pants and a top? Or, is a cocktail dress more appropriate? [SEP] best_answer: Resort dressy means something you would wear on vacation to a resort but is fashionable.  You have to pick light fabrics (linen, cotton, rayon, light silk) and avoid the heavy ones (wool, velvet, etc). Your look has to be light and airy. Since you are going to an award dinner, your best bet will be light silk/rayon. Also avoid dark colors since they have no place in a resort.  The safest to wear will be a white airy dress which you can accessorize appropriately.	Society & Culture

question_title: When does someone says enough, after being taken for a fool.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How long it takes you to say 'enough is enough' depends on how much inner strength you have and how much self respect you have.  Hopefully you learn from experience and the next time things go wrong you can get out quicker with your self respect still in tact.  But some people never learn, and some are gluttons for punishment.\nA lot of this comes down to being needy and not having enough going on in your life, which leads you to become dependent on people and to allow them to mess you around.  If you are happy with your life and strong within yourself then you are less likely to invest your valuable time and emotions in people who take you for granted or don't deserve your energy.\nSome people won't cut away from a bad situation for fear of getting hurt or fear of being alone.  Once you realise that to be alone is nothing to fear, and that emotional pain eases with time, then you are not beholden to these fears anymore and you are better equipped to make the difficult decisions in life.\nI hope that everything works out well for you, whatever your troubles may be.  Take care... :)	Society & Culture

Knowing how gullible my sister is, my mom decided to play a trick.  She told my sister that she needed something from the store. When my sister left, my mom took the turkey out of the oven, removed the stuffing, stuffed a Cornish hen, inserted it into the turkey, and re-stuffed the turkey. She then placed the bird(s) back in the oven. When it was time for dinner, my sister pulled the turkey out of the oven and proceeded to remove the stuffing. When her serving spoon hit something, she reached in and pulled out the little bird. With a look of total shock on her face, my mother exclaimed: "Patricia, you've cooked a pregnant bird!" At the reality of this horrifying news, my sister started to cry. It took the family two hours to convince her that turkeys lay eggs!!!!!!!! HA HA!
