question_title: How would the Fairtax improve your life? [SEP] question_content: Go to Fairtax.org.  read and think.  If you are under 40, you should support this [SEP] best_answer: The fairtax would not only improve my life, but the life of everyone.\n\nUnder this plan, I would not be punished for saving money or selling stocks for a profit.\n\nI am not sure why Steve thinks this would increase taxes on the poor, and give huge tax breaks to the rich.  This is simply not true.\n\nThis plan, like many national sales tax plans I have seen has a tax refund for all money spent up to the poverty level, which means the poor would pay nearly no taxes at all.  This plan would give an automatic $10,000 refund for a single person household, which increases for each additional person, meaning the poor would have at least an extra $10,000 a year of income.  If you are poor than you will not buy enough goods and services to surpass the $10,000+ yearly refund, so the net effect is more money in the pockets of the poor.  Remember a sales tax is a percentage of money spent on goods.  If the national sales tax is 23% and the refund is $10,000, a single person who pays $20,000 a year on goods and services, would have paid $4,600 in taxes.  However, under this plan he would receive a $10,000 refund yielding a net gain of $5,400 each year to either spend or save, and if he were to save it, he would not be taxed on the interest earned on the $5,400 savings.\n \nThe rich are the ones spending the most money, so they will pay the most under this tax plan. \n\nThis plan is the most fair, since if you do not want to pay any taxes then all you have to do is not buy anything and you won't pay any taxes!\n\nGreat Question!

question_title: if some one gets arrested for control device, what are they charged for. what does this mean?

question_title: What will President Bush's guest worker program do? [SEP] question_content: What will President Bush's plan do, and are there any opposing plans being considered? [SEP] best_answer: Guest workers sound great in theory.  But it will be like having illegals with a voice.  Are they citizens?  No.  But they will march just like the pro-illegals marching tomorrow, and guest workers will have a legal foundation to their argument.  People will be more sympathetic:  "Oh, we invited them in."\n\nI'm against the guest worker program.  Read the following.  It's long but good, and I wrote it.\n\n----\n\n\nIllegals aliens are NOT citizens.  They have only HUMAN rights in the USA.  THAT'S IT.  They have no Constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nDeporting them is NOT a civil rights issue.  We have the right to manage our immigration policy however we see fit.\n\nAnd regarding compassion, I have tons of compassion for them.  But we have a country to run, and we can't let people just waltz into the USA.  WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO IMPORT POLITICS.  Poor, uneducated, illiterate people tend to like SOCIALISM.  I don't.  I'm not talking about good all-american bleeding heart liberalism. I'm talking about Castro quality SOCIALISM.\n\nAlso, they are massing in the Southwest by the MILLIONS.  Do you realize that the population of TEXAS is 22 million.  And the proposed legislation wants to make 12 million illegals citizens.  And MOST of those are in the Southwest.  So, don't you think the people of these states have the right to not get their vote diluted by potential SOCIALISTS. This is not about race.  I have no problem with people who are here legally.  But when you allow millions of people in, they congregate together and hold the same political leanings (like allegiance to Mexico and socialistic beliefs).  The fact that most can't speak English just strengthens their solidarity and reinforces their beliefs because they can't understand what most Americans are saying.\n\nThis has the makings of ethnic strife written all over it.  Look at Northern Ireland. Iraq. France. Cyprus. Sudan. Turkey AND Iran with the Kurds.  Quebec in France.  Rwanda.  Yugoslavia.  Chechnya.  China.  And let's not forget Mexico itself, with the indian uprising in the Chiapis.  There is a clear correlation between ethnic strife and large areas that do not integrate into the whole.  This is what will happen if we have entire cities with millions of new non-English speaking citizens spring up in the southwest.  And this will happen if we have an open border.  The 12 million that we're talking about right now is just a start.  What about the next 30 years???  \n\nThe homogeneous culture of America is probably what made America as great as it is.  It is the most populace country in the world with a homogeneous culture.  Yes, we are filled with different races, religions, and ethnicities.  But they all came in, interacted with the other ethnicities, and diffused into living side by side.  Small areas did spring up with primarily one race/religion/ethnicity -- and there was almost always some amount of strife in that area.  Fortunately the areas were small enough to not expand to the level of a national conflict.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the "guest worker" program.  They'll still be dirt poor, but "legal."  Then they'll have a basis for petitioning for rights.  They WILL want citizenship EN MASSE.  It will be the exact same situation, but worse since they'll have been INVITED.\n\nThe best outcome would be that we can integrate them all in.  But that will not happen.  They are poor.  We are typically the product of our homes, and the homes will be uneducated and spanish speaking.  The second best outcome would be a peaceful secession.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather pay a dollar more per pound of oranges, rather than have my kids or grandkids bombed or have to fight a civil war.

And I was a strong supporter of that.  But now, the war is about something else and I don't support it.  I don't ever recall supporting the capturing of Saddam and taking over their country and building it up brand new.  I don't think it's our business, I realize that Saddam did horrible things to the people in his country, but the country was in better shape then than it is now.  The focus of our war is no longer about 9/11, it's about Bush's personal family issues, he's not doing this for the good of our country, he's doing it for himself.  I'm starting to feel that 9/11 was planned, I think that it was a conspiracy within our government, and that our President had a certain hidden agenda.	Politics & Government

question_title: Where is the oldest tree of the world is found? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Guinness Book of World Records currently lists a 12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" as the oldest tree on earth. Previously, the "Methuselah" Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) held the record at about 4,700 years.\n\nThe Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) was first identified as a long-lived tree by Dr Edmund Schulman following surveys in California's White Mountains in 1954. The oldest pines grow at elevations above 3,000 metres in arid, rocky areas of the Great Basin that covers the state of Nevada and parts of Utah and California. (This mountainous area of 500,000 square kilometres has no rivers or creeks flowing out of it.) They exist on the tree line in severe conditions, and often appear to be mostly dead, with only part of the trunk having living bark and leaves. This growth strategy is a response to damage from climate and lightning strikes, and allows the tree to exist on limited resources.\n\nThe bristlecones of Wheeler Peak in Nevada were believed to be older than those found in California. In 1964 a geology student called Donald R. Currey came to Wheeler Peak to study ice age glaciers, partly by collecting tree ring data. Using coring tools, he identified trees over 4,000 years old.\n\nWhen his coring tool jammed inside a massive tree, he asked for, and received, permission from the US Forest Service to cut the tree off at 2.4 metres above the ground and keep a horizontal slab for study. When this slab had its rings counted, it turned out to be over 4,844 years old. Later cores taken closer to ground level by dendrochronologist Don Graybill showed it to be 4,862 years old - the oldest living thing ever discovered.\n\nWheeler Peak is now part of the Great Basin National Park, which was created in 1986.\n\nThen a 4,600+ year old bristlecone called "Methuselah" in the White Mountains of California was considered as the oldest tree now living. Some reports have it as 4,789 years old.\n\nWe can say,today,as ref to The Guinness Book of World Records,12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" is the oldest tree on earth!!

question_title: what is the greatest force in the universe? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would say the strong nuclear force, that holds quarks together in protons and neutrons. This is the strongest if you add up all the individual forces in the universe, as it is present in every proton and neutron in every atom in the universe. If the strong force disappeared, the entire universe would instantly explode into fundamental particles.\n\nOn the other hand, on an everyday scale, the electromagnetic force is most noticeable (it is responsible for everyday forces between objects), and is stronger than gravity (by standing up the electromagnetic forces between atoms of your feet and the floor are overcoming the gravity of an entire planet.)

question_title: Have you ever really touched anything in your life?  What do you think it was? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One of my physics professors believed we can never truly touch anything.  The outer part of every atom is the electrons.  Since electrons are all negative, when we try to touch something our own electrons would cause a repulsion of the electrons in the object we are trying to touch.  He believed that we actually feel the electrons repelling each other - not the actual object.  The electric repulsion would be too great for our hands to actually touch the object.

question_title: why do we get satellite peaks in XRD pattern of superlattices? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because some are geostationary, and others are orbiting, so sometimes there are plenty in the sky above you, and other times there are only a few. In order to stop them hitting each other when they are bunched up they need to move in a synchonised pattern (XRD) of superlatticing and interweaving their trajectories through the crowded field. Eventually society will determine this method is inneficient and put a ceiling on the sky, engulfing the earth in a thin layer of high tech equipment, and this dome ceiling will write the history books as the first major internationally organised and build space structure, paving the way for a human society in space. One day earth will be gone, but humanity will live on.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: i need help with relation problems? [SEP] question_content: i have this bf and i really like him but he acts like he likes my cousin and not me. but he tells everyone that he likes me and not her what should i do should i tell him that i am gettin jealous? or tell him that it is me or her?his friend dosent even know how to help so if you can help me then it will mean alot to me. [SEP] best_answer: If you find out it is her he's interested in, make him choose but don't say "her or me". Here's how you do it. \n\nStart "losing interest" in him....start making it noticeable that you might be interested in one of his friends, or talk to one of your friends to set this up. Make it appear in front of him that you are losing interest in him and gaining interest in someone else. See if you can get 1 of your friends to play along...that would be safest.\n\nTheres only 2 ways he can react. He'll either go for your cousin, if indeed he even likes her. or he will get jealous and be protective of you...and come back to you. Thing is you won't be able to keep him from going to your cousin if he does like her but if i know guys and if i know myself, I will be twice as likely to act out of jealousy and go back after you. See you are his "territory" so to speak, in guy language, and once he sees it being invaded on, he will most likely drop everything to protect what he has. Only don't be too flirtatious so as to cause him to get very angry. Just a bit of interest in someone else should spark his jealousy. But don't make him choose by telling him. I have a rule for myself........I'm never the first one to fall in love....never. This way I have a lot more control to do these sorts of things in order to protect what I really want. It will be very hard if you are already in love with him.\n\nSome guys won't react because of fear of confrontation. If this is your man, observe him out of the corner of your eye whenever you start showing interest in someone else. If you can see he's starting to sweat it, go back over to him and stay with him and make him feel secure. Do it however many times it takes until you get a reaction. Then do it 2-3 more times after that but no more. Once he realizes that what he has is in jeopardy, you've got him.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I de-pants my step son in public. His underware did not come down. I thouhgt it was funny,he did not.He is 10. [SEP] question_content: He told his real mother that i did this and his grandma know the whole family is mad at me for doing this.  The reason i did this was to prove a point that he must wear a belt when he goes to school or out in public.  otherwise his pants and being held up by his privates.  I do not approve of that. So i pants him. [SEP] best_answer: What are you - a juvenile?\n\nI am not surprised your stepson is upset and the family is mad. What you did was assault his person in public. Proving a point is one thing but you did not have to humiliate your stepson by pulling down his pants in public. A private demonstration would have sufficed and as the adult in this particular case, you could have picked a better way to demonstrate why you felt a belt was a good idea.\n\nNext time try explaining the risks to him and then, if he still doesn't get it, demonstrate on yourself (in front of his mother) what could happen if he does not take the precaution of wearing a belt.

[SEP] best_answer: I think that if you have to ask, then no, it wasn't a good idea.  I'm glad that he asked, and I'm glad that you consented.  I'm also glad that you regret it.\nWhat's done is done.  More than likely you will continue the activity, but I want you to consider something....\nJust because the deed is done, doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.  If you really regret it, and feel that you truly were not ready yet, there is absolutely no shame in declining to engage further.  If you feel it appropriate, get together w/ your bf & tell him, "Look, it was really great, but now i regret it, and I just don't think I was ready.  So I'd really like to wait...before I do it again."\nAny good guy will respect that.  If the dude has a fit, drop him.  It's a good test of character.\nAs for you, you can run that game all you want, but I'm willing to bet you'll still be weak enough to give in if the situation comes about  ;-)  Just a fact of life, babe.\nSOooo... yes, it's too late to go back; no, it's not too late to wait; and yes, if you choose to wait, you should avoid situations where you can get caught up in the lust.\nDon't worry.  It happens to the best of us  :-)	Family & Relationships

Is this a common fettish for younger women?  Could it just be the uniform? [SEP] best_answer: Hmmm. Take out the married part and I could see the attraction.  Older men are more mature, and a lot of younger woman find that attractive.  Especially if they're sick of dating immature people.  And it could be the uniform, especially if it is a type that puts you in a place of power (think cop, lol).  I don't really have respect for anyone who goes after a married man.\n\nBut who knows.

question_title: will the Oakland Raiders be in the playoffs in the next two years? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You never know because of how unpredictable the NFL is. Did anyone expect the Panthers to make the Super Bowl after only winning 1 game in 2001?  Did anyone see the Rams winning the Super Bowl in 1999 after being 4-12 the previous season?  No.\nThe Raiders have a chance at making the playoffs, but if had to be $100 on it, I would say no.  They are at the very beginning of a rebuilding phase in which they gradually phase out their veterans and replace them with younger talent.  To keep fans interested, they'll still keep some of their high priced veterans like Moss and Sapp. Al Davis will not admit that's where the team is, but that's what the team is doing. Maybe in 3 or 4 years the team will be contending but not within the next two years.	Sports

question_title: Any truth to this rumor? [SEP] question_content: A friend of mine owns a couple of claiming racehorses. He usually races them at Hoosier Park in Anderson. He recently told me that Churchill Downs Inc. (who owns the track) sold HP and next year the new owners are only running harness racing. Please tell me this isn't true! [SEP] best_answer: I am from Anderson, Indiana and I have not heard about this development. It seems quite unlikely that CDI would sell their shares of Hoosier Park at this time. There will be slots legislature considered soon that could give Hoosier Park a large share of the machines and revenue share from them.\n\nLet me say that we in Anderson are looking forward to hosting the Indiana Derby for many years to come. In addition more and more Indiana bred runners are making their mark nationally. The horse racing industry appears to be very stable in Indiana. Until slots are decided, I cannot predict they will pull out of this market before then.\n\n The company DID sell HP in fact. They sold their controlling interest of Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California last year. The new owners are now running on a very expensive, new  "Polytrack"  surface. I predict that they will conduct racing at that facility for the foreseeable future.\n\n There is some pressure on Hollywood Park to sell the property they own for significant commercial development. I would say the owners response can be measured by their investment in a new track surface. They don't intend to move!\n\n Harness racing is very big in Indiana but they cannot shut out thoroughbred racing interests from the scene.  You or your friend can e-mail to me if you would like to discuss the issue further. I have covered every detail of Hoosier Park since before the day they opened their doors.\n\nHere is a link to their 3rd qtr. earnings report that details their recent activity.\nhttp://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/our_company/company_news/2006_news_releases/company_news_11072006.html	Sports
question_title: Why do so many people love to watch Nascar Racing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, first of all about 5 years ago I thought it was really boring until I started watching it. Now I am total addicted to it, I watch all 3 series of the racing, from the trucks, Busch and Nextel! Once you pick a driver and have friends that watch it, it is alot of fun. It is a very competitive sport actually. Also it is a total adrenaline rush when your driver takes over the lead in turn 3 on the final lap...nothing better to get the blood totally pumping. \nYou have to think of it another way though too, why do so many people watch football? Where with football it is not just one person doing all the work...he has alot of help out there. Where in Nascar if the drivers car is total junk...he has no one else that he can rely on other than himself and his crew to make it better. And if he gets loose and crashes they can't blame anyone else. Where in football...if one player is off that day, they have many more to rely on.\nI say the people that don't know why people watch nascar, probably haven't watched it much and probably haven't given it a chance.\nMy suggestion is to pick a driver (just not Jr. to join that ban wagon) but someone that you can connect with and start watching and than maybe you will understand why people watch.

question_title: Ever been to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park? [SEP] question_content: what is your opinion?  did you camp?  did you kayak?  did you dive?  did you snorkel? where is the best place to get a good shot of the sunrise, or sunset?  let me know about your experience with the park. thouse who fill in the most details will be voted best. [SEP] best_answer: I've been there several times as I lived nearby for six years. You can rent kayaks, snorkel, and dive in several places along the keys. I went snorkeling off of Key Largo and there's plenty to see. If you are interested in seeing sharks I recommend getting a kayak and go to Cudjoe Key which is a few miles up from Key West. Expect to see black tip reef and nurse sharks, sting rays are plenty. If you snorkel, watch for jellies, they will leave you itching. \n\nI don't know of any camping on the keys but if you have the time I believe you can overnight at the Dry Tortugas which is off the coast of Key West therefore only accessible by plane or boat, this former military fort site has excellent snorkeling.  Best place to get a sunrise/sunset pic is there and another good sunset pic would be from Mallory Square in Key West. Be sure to catch the Sunset Celebration every night at Mallory Square, too! Sunrise pics are best from the east side of any island. There are plenty of web sites you can get info from. Don't forget sunscreen!!!	Sports

question_title: How do u make an ice rink 4 ur backyard? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Buy a "backyard ice rink" kit. I've seen these advertised in hockey magazines like the USA Hockey members magazine. They are easily found on the web as well. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, you will minimally need to put together some kind of frame and potentially lay out plastic to keep the water from seeping into the ground.  If you have a natural depression in your yard (as was the case with my dirt driveway when growing up) and you don't care about the shape of your rink you could just fill it with water when it gets cold enough.  You can't get much cheaper than that!	Sports

[SEP] best_answer: Hi,\n\nLuis Galarza here...\n\nWell my friend if you really want to earn more money in 2 month and maybe build a business that will generate a monthly residual income and not just "more money" I really recommend you to go for Partnership business and MLM or Network Marketing... Why? Simple because you can start any of this business with no or little investment from your part.\n\nPartnership Business: When I said partnership business I am talking about that you can earn more money with JV or Joint Venture Partnerships and Affiliate or Associate Program Marketing. \n\nThis type of business can be very lucrative if you know how to market on the internet the right way. Plus, you don't need:\n\n- A product\n- Employees\n- Office or storefront\n- Merchant Account\n- Phone\n\nAnd you don't have to worry about returns, customer service or sales support, the merchant does all that for you. The only thing you have to do is send traffic to the unique link or links the merchant provide you when you sign up for their affiliate program.\n\nMLM or Network Marketing: Is just another form of Affiliate Program where you can make money by selling the merchant's products or services and you can earn even more money by introducing more people to the business opportunity and teaching them to do the same, which is what network marketers call "Downline".\n\nThe bigger your downline the less work you need to do and the more money you can earn. You can do the same thing on some multi-tier or multi-level affiliate programs... (See resource box for some useful links).\n\nDid you know that even Donald Trump knows that Network Marketing is the way to go... That's exatly what he recommends to anyone who wants to start a new business on a low budget. \n\nAnd he's right... Because you get everything you need from the business plan, business training, and business supplies design to help you earn more money.\n\nPros: Low or no investment, and big money to be make\n\nCons: 95% to 98% make little or no money on ths industrys.\n\nThat's why I really recommend you to get the training you need to have a successful business venture that can earn you more and money for years to come...\n\nHope this little tip will help you.\n\nTo YOUR Success,\n\nLuis Galarza, CEO of\nFree Affiliate Marketing Training Membership Site\nhttp://www.AffiliateCashSecretsClub.com/ \n\nP.S. Test you marketing until you find what works for you, don't be like those poeple that can't earn any money on a affiliate program or network marketing opportunity and then they call it scam.\n\nRemember any business have the potential to make money and you are the only one that can make it happen!\n\nAlso you can visit my blog for more tips at:\nhttp://luisgalarza.blogspot.com/ \n\n\n\n\n.

The guy on the phone did not pressure me in any way and out of all the options I've come accross for a home bussiness this one seems the best cause not only will I be featuring their products but I can sell my own personal stuff as well with 95% profit and you get 5 paychecks a month -one a week and one a month - so let me know if you own on of these sites - I'd love to hear what you have to say about it [SEP] best_answer: There is something in the ripoffreport.com warning against this company. \n\nhttp://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/ripoff153493.htm\n\nOne thing I'll warn you against is basically you are paying them to give you a website that is EXACTLY what other of their customers have, with the same EXACT products as the other members. How do you expect to earn money from that?\n\nTake a look at their sample store pages and the first two sites they feature http://www.ecashstreet.com/?pg=samples\n\nhttp://www.estorebiz.com/snic/\nhttp://www.greatfindsbyshari.com/\n\nOne thing that jumped at me is that these two pages look VASTLY DIFFERENT from the screenshot in the sample pages page of ecashstreet.com. Greatfindsbyshari.com on the sample page looks very professional with a woman standing in the top middle - but clicking on the site goes to a drab looking template and the only sign of greatfindsbyshari.com is the logo.\n\nI say stay away with it. You are not going to make money by signing up with them. Having the same replica website offering the same exact products with hundreds or thousands of other websites is the surest way to lose money on the Web.	Business & Finance

question_title: How far in advance should you start the home buying process compared to when you'd actually move in? [SEP] question_content: For instance..we plan to move around November December is it too soon to begin looking?  Or is now the perfect time to at least start getting ideas and looking around to see what's out there? [SEP] best_answer: You will usually take as few as 15 days to as many as 45 days to close from the day you sign the agreement. So ideally you would make offers you expect to be accepted at 45 days from the move in date. You will then raise the offers them and tighten up the closing date as the deadline approaches if you have to move. Remember there is usually a day or two before it funds and you get the keys, or put in the offer you take possesion at closing. Otherwise it is at funding.\n\nYou should start getting comfortable with the market by looking on your own. You probably don't want to tie up your own agent for this long. So call the listing agent when you want to see inside a house. Otherwise just look at the prices and the paper and maybe drive by. Once you are ready to start making real offers within a month then get your agent lined up. You will even have several that you already talked to and you might like.\n\nAnother option is to start making lowball offers in the mean time and see if any get accepted. My wife and I started looking in Jan a few years ago and made offers 15% below the listed price if it was a very reasonable price, and as much as 20-25% if it was inflated for a big sell. (you can use www.zillow.com to help with valuation, but it isnt perfect remember). It took 8 offers (7 rejections) and we moved in in July to a house that was appraised for 10% more than we paid! Just tell your agent what the plan is so she isn't surprised when you don't come up to reasonable offers. You might even consider springing for lunch once in a while since you are really making her work hard.\n\nMake sure you can afford to have the house early if you get it, otherwise you might not want to try that.\n\nGood luck	Business & Finance
question_title: prequalification? [SEP] question_content: if I was prequalified for $90,100 for a home purchase, the program say's that I have 100% financing, with $0 down, but I want to purchase a house for $250,000, how does that work. Also my closing cost is included in the package. how does this work and how would I calculate a mortgae payment? [SEP] best_answer: First of all, just to let you know, being "pre-qualified" is really nothing. It doesn't take into account your credit history or score, it isn't based on any facts, it is to loose to be taken seriously.\n\nSo, what you need to do is get pre-approved. And the only thing that should cost you is 30-35 dollars (maybe) for the cost of the credit report the mortgage company is charged by the company that supplies them the information. If anyone tries to charge you more than that to get pre-approved, they are ripping you off and you should go elsewhere! \n\nPre-approvals actually take into account factual information you supply such as income (which they verify), savings/bank balances/investment (also verified), pulled credit history, so on and so forth. It shouldn't take more than 48 hours to get the pre-approval letter.\n\nNow, in regards to the whole 100% financing plus having closing costs paid through the loan rather than out of pocket - BEWARE!!!!!!! That means that they are upping the interest rate to pay all that stuff and chances are they are also raising it to the point that they are getting more then 1% commission out of you and you will never know it.\n\nGo someplace other than who has "pre-qualified" you and start fresh. Tell them you want to be "pre-APPROVED" for 100% financing for the highest amount you qualify for and ask them to give you the "par" interest rate which means the rate you can get where there is no "cost" and no "rebate". After you find out what the "par" rate is, THEN you can ask them what your rate will be if you have a large enough rebate to cover the closing costs. Otherwise, if you get the whole closing costs paid out of the rate thing from the beginning, you are asking to be taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, if your particular situation is more difficult than the average borrower's, then it is perfectly ethical for the lender to make up to a 1.5% commission off of you and if you also only can get a small loan on top of that a maximum 2% commission - but even that's pushing it when it comes to fairness.\n\nJust be careful who you go to because the mortgage lending business if FULL of crooks and sharks. Ask friends and family who they recommend.\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: Why Does The Goverment Care What Race WE Are? [SEP] question_content: Why does it really matter what race we seriously? Why is it so important what difference would it make, why are there minorities, why,why why are we labling people as minorities, they're all just people, people just look different and have a different skin color thats it, it's not like a white person can't have kids with a black person, this is getting out of hand i think some one  should speak up to the goverment and put an end to asking what race are we, theres no point to it really. [SEP] best_answer: In my honest and humble opinion... I think the government is doing it to avoid a law suit or being labeled as prejudice themselves. The government isn't the ones that said hey im being discriminated against because of my race or nationality it is a few squeaky wheels that messed with the cog so much our government had no choice but to acknowledge there is a difference in skin tones. Its scary that people always blame someone else often our government for their short comings rather than accept that they aren't perfect, learn from their mistakes, move on, and try to become better people by learning from their mistakes.\n\n\nHave a GREAT day!

question_title: Shouldn't Religion and Sprituality be in this section? [SEP] question_content: Do we really need two sections for the same subject? Isn't it confusing? [SEP] best_answer: I would say yes and no. Mythology is basically religious and/or spiritual stories meant to teach, which is basically what everything from the Bible to the tales of Zeus, Jupiter, Odin, etc. etc. are.  But folklore is not always religious, so that I would not put under Religion and Spirituality, necesarily. If you did split them up, I would put Mythology under Religion and Spirituality and Folklore maybe under Books and Authors.	Society & Culture

How come people forget to let people know where they live? [SEP] best_answer: I usually put return to sender and send it back. Thing is, I've lived in this apartment for over 5 years, and I sometimes still get mail for previous tenants. Anymore sometimes I can't help but open it to see what it is.

question_title: why there should be a God / Gods? [SEP] question_content: Don't tell me God save me or you or the whole humanity.

I know someone would say, but there are no such more perfect answers, so let's just believe in god. however, nothing is predetermined. One never know what will happen.

question_title: How do you know that your spouse is a manipulator? [SEP] question_content: It seems I would like to get out of my relationship,but everytime I find that reason he turns it around and makes me feel that I am in the wrong.  Like him being bi, he said that it is all in my head.  He blames ms for him not wanting to have sex.  Are there other people out there that are too nice and feel guilty for leaving?   I am sooo frustrated. [SEP] best_answer: At the end of the day, you have to put yourself first. That can be easier said than done, but you do yourself no favours by staying in a relationship that causes you unhappiness. When you do eventually walk away, you will soon realise that it was a good decision, and you will feel better for it. In fact, you will wonder why you did not do it before. No good person wants to break a relationship, but no bad relationship is worth the suffering of a good person. It is your goodness that he is exploiting, but he probably does it unknowingly, because he is not well. I imagine that he needs help, but professional help, and that there is nothing that he will let you do for him. Maybe your departure will alert him to his defects. Let's hope so.	Society & Culture

I took out 15 feet of guardrail and impaled the metal from it into the back of the drivers seat. The next day the State Trooper and tow truck driver both called me at home to tell me that they had gone to look at my rig during the daylight.  They both  told me that I must have a Guardian Angel, because there was NO WAY I should have walked away from that crash without a scratch.

Most atheist ideas are "We are all ignorant so you are too" when it really comes down to it. God and our logic don't mix so therefore since we don't understand God doesn't exist, or something like that tell me your thoughts. [SEP] best_answer: For the same reason that so many Christians try to convert not only atheists, but followers of other faiths. \n\nIf one is so convinced that one is correct, there will be that tendency to spread one's beliefs.\n\nAlso, I'd question your use of the term "always".

[SEP] question_content: It can be Christmas, thanksgiving, whatever holiday you celebrate  just let it be funny [SEP] best_answer: We were having Thanksgiving Dinner a few years ago and we had the whole gang of about 20 people around.  My husband's Dad who was about 95 at the time and who had had recent chemotherapy for cancer all of a sudden got ill at the table and vomited into his napkin.  I quickly grabbed his napkin took it to the kitchen sink, shook it out and rinsed it out really good.  I then turned on the garbage disposal and all of a sudden there was this horrendous racket in the garbage disposal.  I turned it off and reached down into it and pulled out a very mangled set of false teeth. I screeched , oh my and everyone crowded around me and we all started to giggle, even though it really was not entirely funny.  We gave grandpa back his false teeth and he put them back in but they were totally missing teeth.  We all tried not to laugh but it really was a bit humorous. We will all never forget that moment.  Dad has passed on now about 7 years ago but that moment will live on and be passed on to future generations.	Society & Culture

If he had, he wouldn't be good enough for God - according to the [SEP] question_content: Bible:\n\n Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron that in all future generations, his descendants who have physical defects will not qualify to offer food to their God.  No one who has a defect may come near to me, whether he is blind or lame, stunted or deformed, or has a broken foot or hand, or has a humped back or is a dwarf, or has a defective eye, or has oozing sores or scabs on his skin, or has damaged testicles.  Even though he is a descendant of Aaron, his physical defects disqualify him from presenting offerings to the LORD by fire.  Since he has a blemish, he may not offer food to his God.  However, he may eat from the food offered to God, including the holy offerings and the most holy offerings.  Yet because of his physical defect, he must never go behind the inner curtain or come near the altar, for this would desecrate my holy places.  I am the LORD who makes them holy."

question_title: where can i get a spell/potion to get rid of obsession?? [SEP] question_content: my brother is hardly God damn obsessed in a certain sport here in our place and he never stop watchin a t v show w/c airs his favorite sport and he is going nuts! [SEP] best_answer: I think the "spell" you are looking for is called "reverse psychology".  The more you let go of your reaction to his obsession, the less it will be one.  Some ideas:\n\n(0) Ask yourself why is this conflict happening?\nWhy are you sharing a place? Is this a sign that you need to get separate places? Who pays the rent? If you pay more, you make the rules. If he doesn't like it, he can leave.  If you'd rather leave, why not? Could be advantages to having your own place.\n\n(1) Does he normally go through an obsession, burn out, and go on to another?  If this is his pattern, let him OD on it and get over it faster.  \n\n(2) Anytime he sits down to watch, invite people over to "enjoy" it with him, who he doesn't want to share it with.  He will go somewhere instead.  \n\n(3) Is the enthusiasm a true interest? If so, does he have any other friends to share it with? Encourage him to take turns enjoying at friends' houses, at least 50-50, if not rotating the days of the week. That will reduce your turn to host it in your place.\n\nOverall, sounds like he needs more of a social life. If he has nothing else to do, he is projecting all his emotional needs on this one joy he has discovered.  Either let him have his joy, or ask friends of his to help him share it in other ways or other places.\n\nAs for you, what do you want and where would you rather be? if you can occupy your mind with more engaging things than his sports obsession, you won't notice or care as much where his mind is. What are your goals? What creative projects would you like to pursue? Think of your interests, and don't worry about his.	Society & Culture

Yeah, it gets hot, but from my experience, it depends on my surroundings.  At home, it's gets warm and stays warm just a few minutes after I wake it up, but at school, i can keep it going and it stays pretty cool.  I've also used it outside in shade with a good breeze.  It stayed pretty cool then.  Pillows block the airflow to the bottom and also insulate the heat...not a good idea.

question_title: which desktop enviromrt should i use gnome or kde or xfce? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are confused about choosing which is better then don't get confused it depends totally on your needs...\n\nYour need for speed:\n\nOne of the big differences between the GUI is the relative workload they put on your system. The more a GUI has goodies, features and eye candies, the more it will need power to run properly and the slower it will be.\nKDE and Gnome are two of the most developed, and heavy, GUI available for Linux. Thus, if speed is of prime importance for you (for example, you want the maximum of power to run a task or you have a slow PC), you may be better to use a lightweight GUI, like IceWM, Fluxbox or Afterstep. In other word, the lighter your GUI is, the faster your overall system will be...\n\nWhich applications are you using?\n\nThe fact is that some applications just run better in one GUI than others.\nKDE and Gnome are based on a different set of programming libraries and tools (named GTK for Gnome and Qt for KDE). Thus, it's easy to understand that applications designed and based on the same GTK libraries than Gnome will work better under Gnome than under KDE. And the reverse will be true for applications based on  Qt.\nSo, it may be better to use the GUI that works best with your applications. If don't know the libraries used by your applications, just try them with different GUI and see if it makes any significant difference. For some applications it will, for others it won't. Thus, your favourite applications may help you determine which GUI you should use.\n\nConviviality and ease of use:\nThis point is more a personal choice, some peoples may find that KDE is convivial and easy to use, but others will be overwhelm with the hundreds of features and options... The choice is up to you, each GUI is, more or less, easy to use, you just have to make the best choice for you...\nHowever, if you're familiar with Windows, you may feel more at ease with Gnome or KDE, which are similar, than with a less classic GUI (like Enlightenment for example).\n\nThe default GUI of your distribution:\nAll distribution give preferential support and integration to one or several GUI. If you have Mandrake, both KDE and Gnome are equally supported. But Red Hat never hides their preference for Gnome, and SuSe for KDE...\nAll other things being equal, it may be a good idea to use your distribution's favourite GUI. It will be less hassle since it's the default installation and configuration. Integration and the "polish" will also be better, default settings being usually just fine. It's also easier to get support, since most peoples using this distribution will use the default GUI.\n\nYour need for eye candies:\nAll the GUI have a different look, some are gorgeous with lot of effects, font anti-aliasing, nice icons, and all kind of goodies, others look pale and simple in comparison. The choice between these two extremes is only a matter of personal preferences. Some will prefer a GUI with lot of eye candies, others just want a clean desktop on a simple background. None is better than the other, it's up to you to make your choice...\n\nFinal words:\n\nWith these points in mind, you should now be more able to choose a GUI. However, remember that choosing a GUI doesn't mean that you have to stick with it for the rest of your life! Nothing prevents you to install many GUI on your system. Then you choose the one you want when you log in. You may choose the GUI that's the most appropriate for the task...	Computers & Internet

question_title: who invented the Internet? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Creation of the Internet\nMain article: History of the Internet \nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead. DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the "eve" network of today's Internet. In December of 1970, Charles A. Petrik contacted the U.S. Navy and suggested that a special communications network, that the Department of Defense had built for use in the possiblitity of a nuclear attack, could also be used during peace time. Petrik convinced the military to connect the computers of the U.S. National Laboratories for scientific research purposes, and to allow these labs to get data to other labs faster, and safer.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by 1 January 1983 , when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN, which straddles the border between France and Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN (which was set up by international treaty and not bound by the laws of either France or Switzerland). In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign released the Mosaic web browser version 1.0, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word "Internet" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.

question_title: How do you connect an F type plug to the coaxial cable? Is there more than one type of F plug? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are asking how to connect an F connector to a bare end coax cable then the answer is usually with a crimper.  What type of crimper depends on what type of F connector you have.  Some use side crimps that actually pinch the connector onto the cable, some actually screw onto the cable, and the last and most often used by professional installers is the compression fitted connectors requiring, you guessed it, a compression crimper.  You should be able to pick up many of these at your local hardware store or radio shack.  I will tell you though that the compression tool itself can be quite expensive, I've seen anywhere from $50 to $100 and the actual connectors usually run about $1 to $2 each, and these can be harder to find.  Unless you are looking to run alot of cable, it might be better to find someone, like a local satellite installer, to make some cables for you.	Computers & Internet

For more than 3 years I have completely stopped taking my asthma meds. How? I changed my diet to organic and wholefoods. Asthma is a typically reactive disease. Your body is reacting to an irritant. The 2 main irritants that our body is reacting to is 1) our unhealthy environment, and 2) our steady diet of artificially flavored, presevative loaded, hormone induced, antibiotically treated, chemically laced, saturated fatty foods. Check your food labels. We are making ourselves sick and sicker by what we eat. Asthma, diabetes, High blood pressure, High cholesterol and Obesity are attacking the youth by the thousands. Go organic - Drink Water (not soda) - Begin a moderate exercise and jogging program -Wean yourselve slowly from those asthma meds until you don't need them anymore. To your health.	Health

[SEP] question_content: is there a medical condition out there that will make you have periods twice a month that could decrese your fertility? also what else could this cause and also what could be causing me to have my period every other week... [SEP] best_answer: "Anovulatory uterine bleeding" or AUB is diagnosis of exclusion arrived at when other causes of abnormal bleeding have been ruled out (examples include uterine fibroids or polyps, injury or disease caused by intercourse, infection, genital warts, fluctuation in hormone levels, stopping and starting birth control pills or estrogens, low thyroid function, IUD use, anticoagulant drugs, cervical conization or cauterization procedures).  \n\nOcurring in 20% of adolescents and 40% of women over 40, AUB is typically characterized by less than 28 days between menstrual periods and/or otherwise abnormal menstrual periods, menstrual flow ranging from scanty to profuse, mood swings, hot flashes, vaginal tenderness, and Hirsuitism (excessive hair growth, often evident in women with PCOS).  Unfortunately, AUB can cause infertility, resulting from lack of ovulation.  It can also cause anemia.  Oral contraceptives or progestogen therapy are frequently used to treat AUB,  and ovulation induction may also be necessary if fertility is desired.  \n\nTreatment is successful in about 80% of cases, but some women experience such resistant, severe symptoms that they opt for surgical therapy like endometrial ablation.  \n\nYour GYN can help you diagnose whether AUB or another condition is involved.  Depending on the cause, he or she can help you choose the right treatment and get you on your way to feeling better.\n\nGood luck.	Health

But it wasn't bleeding after I spit. My jaw doesn't hurt and the pain is gone. I think I may need a root canal my mom says maybe it is my wisdom teeth. I'm only 17. So what the heck is going on and why was it swollen and popped? Please help thanks [SEP] best_answer: Abcess.. Oh yeah! \nBasically, your tongue popped it and the 'uaually' yellowish color was the infection. Yes, you now need to get the doctor (dentist) and have him/her xray it and get you started on antibotics. If the tooth is able to be saved, then yes.. Root Canal Treatment, is going to be needed. Then a crown, is needed. If the tooth cant be saved, then he'll pull it. They'll need an x'ray to determine how bad the infection was and if any bone loss has occured. Thats how they'll decided if it can be saved or not. \n\nBTW... Warm salty rinses, is GOOD ADVICE! BUT.. wont stop it from coming back. It's a temp, fix.  \n\nGood Luck....	Health

question_title: Keratosis pilaris, NO CURE! seen mostly in pale obese people now i seem to have it on the backs of arms? [SEP] question_content: there must be a cure somewhere..Anyone know of studies one can participate in? [SEP] best_answer: There is a cure for every disorder. Yoy can only help yourself out with temporary cures if you do not address the the cause. Dehydration is the most probable cause of setting off this condition. 75% of Americans are 6-8 glasses of water dehydrated and their taste response is so misguided that they sense hunger when they are thirsty. The other problem that Americans have is their food has poor mineral content. \n\nDrinking 6-8 glasses of distilled water with a pinch of unrefined sea salt will rehydrate and remineralize your body. This could by itself make your skin supple and healthy. \n\n30 minutes of sunlight every day will help.\n\nEating oily fish or a fish oil supplement could help.\n\nAlmond and walnuts are great sources of good oil.\n\nSwitch from drinking toxic milk to almond milk or walnut milk.\n\nConsider externally usiing coconut oil with squeezed lemon juice for lightening. \n\nEat less processed foods and more raw foods.\n\nThe cure is out there but is it worth the changes of diet and lifestlye? Our bodies are wonderful mechanisms that want to be healed. Chicken Skin is just an indicator to change your diet and lifestyle. Later in life it might be in the form of much more dangerous symptoms.

question_title: find x   find y? [SEP] question_content: In a 30- 60 -90 triangle where the length of the hypotenuse is 20, the shorter leg is x, and the longer leg is y. find x    find y [SEP] best_answer: First of all, look at the link in my sources... It contains a picture that will help you understand what I'm trying to explain!\n\nIf the hypotenuse is 20, you know the shorter leg (x), or the leg across from the angle that measures 30°, is half of that.  You know this because of the 30°-60°-90° triangle that you will probably want to memorize for your math classes (see image).  So 20*(1/2) = 10.  x = 10.\n\nNow that you have the lengths of 2 out of 3 of the sides, you COULD simply use the pythagorean theorem to solve for y.  But if you have a calculater and your 30°-60°-90° triangle memorized, then you can do it easier and faster.  According to the image, the ratio between the shorter leg and the longer leg is 1:rt.3 (rt.3 meaning square root of 3.)  That means that all you have to do is take the length of the shorter leg, and multiply it by rt.3.  Since you know the length of the shorter leg (x) is 10, this is very easy.  10*rt.3 = 17.32.  y = 17.32\n\nIn conclusion, to answer your question, x = 10, y = 17.32.\n\nYou could also use sine and cosine formulas to solve this problem, but I personally like my way better.  If you'd like me to explain the sin and cosine way of solving this problem, hit me w/ an e-mail and I'll help if you need it!\n\nI hope I helped, and I hope my explanation wasn't too difficult to understand!

question_title: Why is the normal snooze time nine minutes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Simple.

So an ideal snooze time has been designated so that a person is really ready to 'touch down' in about 9-10 minutes after he or she wakes. \n\nSnooze time in some clocks/phones is 5 mins while in others it is 10 mins. Some models allow the user to set their own snooze time.	Education & Reference
question_title: what play activites can i use for young children with autism? [SEP] question_content: such as ages 3yrs old and 6yrs old [SEP] best_answer: Autistics remain in the infancy level of play because of their difficulty with socialization (at least until they are older and able to learn the "why" behind social rules). They parallel play rather than interact with others.\n\nTherefore, any games that are individual play are good. Many autistics do enjoy social company, with careful respect for their personal space and interaction focused on their own interests.\n\nTry puzzles, interactive educational computer programs (like Reader Rabbit), art activities, etc.  Many autistics will "play" with objects that spin, swirl, etc. because it keys in to their fascination for repeating details.\n\nWith older autistics who like puzzles, we  often use them to start to teach the idea of "turn taking." Your crowd is a bit young for that, though.\n\nDon't forget that autistics absolutely must have rigid structure and routine. "Play time" should be carefully defined, organized, and at the same time every day... and you may have difficulties the first few times you do it until the kids get used to it being part of the routine.

[SEP] best_answer: I believe it is "Alec."  Sick and tired means that you are NOT literally ill, just sick (or tired) of the situation.\n\nHere is the info that you might be interested in as far as Smart Alec:\nFor many years, Smart Alec or Smart Aleck was thought to be no more than a generic character, first cousin to Clever Dick. The problem with seeking his original is the obvious one that, with so many possible candidates, only a stroke of luck might lead a researcher to the right Alec. A plausible candidate has been put forward by Professor Gerald Cohen (for the full story, see G L Cohen, Studies in Slang, Part 1, 1985). He argues that the original was Alex Hoag, a celebrated and clever thief in New York in the 1840s.\n\nHoag worked with his prostitute wife Melinda and an accomplice called French Jack to fleece unwary visitors to the city who were looking for a little fun. The key to his activities was that they did so in close association with two police officers, who shared the loot and provided protection. Most was done by what was in effect pickpocketing, with Melinda taking the victim’s pocketbook while they were otherwise engaged and surreptitiously handing it to Hoag or French Jack as they walked by. So far, so commonplace. However, his downfall came because he got into financial difficulties and tried to cheat his police protectors out of their share of the loot. One way was that Hoag lay behind a wall in a churchyard and had Melinda drop the goods over the wall to him so that the constables couldn’t see the exchange.\n\nAnother of the standard frauds, practised by many, was called the panel game. George Wilkes, the assistant editor of the Subterranean, met Hoag while Wilkes was falsely imprisoned in the infamous New York prison called The Tombs. Wilkes described the trick in a diary of 1844, The Mysteries of the Tombs: “Melinda would make her victim lay his clothes, as he took them off, upon a chair at the head of the bed near the secret panel, and then take him to her arms and closely draw the curtains of the bed. As soon as everything was right and the dupe not likely to heed outside noises, the traitress would give a cough, and the faithful Aleck would slily enter, rifle the pockets of every farthing or valuable thing, and finally disappear as mysteriously as he entered.” The victim was then persuaded to leave in a hurry through a window by Alec banging on the door, pretending to be an aggrieved husband who has suddenly returned from a trip away.\n\nHoag used this trick to avoid paying off his police protectors, so that when he was caught, the police were in no mood to aid him. He was sentenced to jail, but escaped through the help of his brother, only to be recaptured following extensive police searches (by one of those odd coincidences, having been recognised by Wilkes).\n\nProfessor Cohen suggests that Alex Hoag was given the sobriquet of smart Alec by the police for being a resourceful thief who outsmarted himself by trying to avoid paying graft. It’s impossible to be certain this is the true story, since the expression doesn’t appear in print until 1865, but it does seem extremely plausible.	Education & Reference

question_title: i am an actress in training but i am not very good at remembering my sripts plzz help!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have the same problem when I'm learning scripts, and I encountered it day after day until I tried this little old trick: Remember a key word from each line you have. Spend time learning the script itself, and when you get to that awkward stage where you sort of remember the lines and yet keep slipping up, and use the key words to help you. Almost like a mental dot-to-dot, or map. It seems to work wonders for me; hope this helps!	Entertainment & Music
