question_title: What happens to the body when somebody has taken an lethal overdose? [SEP] question_content: Could it be the brain shuts down first or the other organs start to fail continusoly?  If a postmorten came out with the lungs undefected, how come they didnt get affected? [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like you have a particular scenario in mind, so here goes...\n\nPeople who use street drugs develop a tolerance to them, so they need bigger and bigger doses to "get high." Sometimes they increase the dose too much and overdose. Another problem is purity. Average street drugs are only about 50% the actual drug, and 50% filler to increase the dealer's profit margin(although heroin has gotten much more pure recently...). When an addict gets drugs from a different supplier, he might get a different concentration than what he's used to and unintentionally overdose.\n\nCocaine and amphetamines ("meth") are stimulants. An OD on them can cause a heart attack, where the heart stops beating, blood flow to the brain stops, and the person dies. It would not cause any obvious lung damage.\n\nMost other drugs of abuse--opiates (heroin, oxycodone, vicodin, demerol etc.), alcohol, GHB, benzodiazepines (xanax, valium, clonapin) slow down the rate and/or depth of your breathing so you go to sleep and stop breathing. This causes lack of oxygen in the blood, and this causes brain damage leading to death.\n\nNeither of these paths will cause any visible damage to the lungs.  Most of the damage is at the cellular level, so to the naked eye, the organs look normal.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Why are meteorologists so inaccurate? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Try this - predict, to the second, how long it will take to boil 1 liter of water. \n\nThen, test it. You will quickly see that there are MANY factors involved (is the pan a good conductor of heat? Electric or gas stove? Is the water 100% pure? What is the barometric pressure? What setting are you using to heat the cooktop?) and that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty what will or won't happen. \n\nThat is essentially what meteorologists do - They try to predict the occurrence of something we know is possible by knowing very limited information.

question_title: Base triplet on T-RNA recognizing complementary base triplet on M-RNA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: t-RNA or transfer RNA consists of short RNA coupled to specific amino acids.  mRNA is translated into protein in ribozomes, via pairing with tRNA.  The pairing takes the form of a three letter code called a codon.  The pairing bases occur on the tRNA in the stem-loop structure.  The pairing is complementary, A with U, C with G.  However, the third position of the anti-codon on the tRNA is called the wobble position because an unusual nucleotide, inosine, can be found in some tRNAs.  This nucleotide can bind to A, U, or C. This leads to a single tRNA with a single amino acid being able to recognize and bind different codons.  Evolutionarily, it means that mutations in the coding sequence of DNA will not necessarily cause a change in the protein, depending on if the mutation is a point mutation of a wobble position.

question_title: how do classification systems help us to think about and study diversity on earth? [SEP] question_content: lots of detail please [SEP] best_answer: Taxonomic classification systems are useful for a couple of significant reasons.  First and foremost, it creates a name for each living organism that ALL scientists can agree upon.  Therefore, biologists on opposite sides of the world can be confident that they are discussing the same organism when looking at the taxonomic label of that organism.  Secondly, the design of the system is useful for showing evolutionary relationships among organisms.  Generically, the breakdown is kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.  There are five kingdoms (six in some systems) and millions upon millions of species.  For any two organisms, they are more closely related evolutionarily if they share a classification more toward the species.  For example, two organisms that share a genus are more closely related than two other organisms that only share a family.  You should know that there modifications of the above system so that you get things like subphyla, superfamilies, etc.  The genus and species names are GENeral and SPECIfic for a particular organism and are always written in italics, with the genus name being capitalized and the species name beginning with a lower-case letter.  The millions of species described by the system is a testimony to the great biodiversity of life on this planet.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does anyone have tips on how to sleep with PVCs or PACs? [SEP] question_content: Premature atrial and ventricular contractions are considered harmless by the 3 doctors and 2 cardiologists I've seen, but what a pain in the ass!  Those of you who are as unfortunate as me to actually feel every single one of them, how do you cope?  I can't sleep, and then being tired makes them worse.  I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.  If none of those work, you might at least get some consolation from others with similar problems.  The first link below is to a forum that seems to have a number of people with PVCs and PACs.

He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.\n\n3. Beat a dead horse (actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled. For example, if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind, then to keep asking can be described as  - Beating (Flogging) a dead horse. In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer. But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses :-)\n\nThe expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse (to make it work harder) if it is dead!!

question_title: henry hudson's fourth voyage? [SEP] question_content: Wat did he do on his fourth voyage help me plz. [SEP] best_answer: Henry Hudson's Fourth Voyage\n1610: The Northwest Passage\n\nMore info at link below:\n\n    Henry Hudson managed to get support from English backers for another voyage, this time in search of a Northwest Passage, one he had wanted to pursue almost since the start of his voyages. The main sponsor this time was Sir Thomas Smythe - governor and treasurer of the Virginia Company, and also of the English East India Company. Smythe desperately needed to recoup his losses after a disaster that saw his last fleet to Virginia scattered, with hundreds of men lost. He may not have paid Hudson for his services - rather, it may have been Hudson's payment for Smythe getting Hudson out of house arrest. \n\nThe voyage started inauspiciously with a company man put off the ship and a another man brought aboard - Henry Greene, a gambler who would prove a partner in trouble with Juet. Almost from the start there was trouble with the crew. Hudson's ability to manage his crew appears even weaker than in previous voyages. There were fights and almost a mutiny within the first few months, before they even reached the area Hudson intended to explore.\n\nDiscovery ended up sailing through the treacherous Arctic waters north of modern Quebec - the Furious Overfall - known today as Hudson's Strait although he did not discover it - and into a large body of water now known as Hudson Bay.\n\nBy the fall of the year the crew was stuck hundreds of miles south, unable to go further or to get home. They had to endure a harsh winter in that hostile land, during which one crewman died and most others were sickened by scurvy or lack of food. Again, Hudson's showed his inability to deal with the natives and his own crew during the cold months they spent ashore.\n\nBy late next spring, the ship was ready to sail again. Hudson wanted to continue his explorations, but the crew only wanted to head home. Fights broke out over food and Hudson accused some crew members of hoarding. They in turn accused him of the same. Eventually a large number of crew members, led by Juet and Greene, decided to mutiny. They put the captain, his son and others they didn't like into a small shallop and set it adrift while the Discovery sailed away. None of the abandoned crew were ever seen again.

If u want to get admission in TOP scholls what is the requirement of TOEFL score [SEP] best_answer: TOEFL Score Interpretation\n\nD.W. McKeon, Director, ESL & GTA Training Programs \n\nExecutive Summary \nI. Introduction\nII. Overall Scores and Subscores \nIII. Other Factors Affecting TOEFL Scores \nIV. The Old GRE Verbal Section and the TOEFL \nV. The New GRE Analytical Writing Section and the TOEFL \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language, TOEFL, developed in the early 1960’s, has become the main instrument of measuring English language proficiency for international students around the world. A total score (range of 310-677) was determined based on the scores of three subsections: Listening, Structure, and Reading; (note: an optional essay was administered at every other international testing date, the Test of Written English, TWE, with a score range of 0 to 6). \n\nIn the late 1990’s, the TOEFL Board produced a computer-based test (CBT; range: 40 to 300. Other than the supposed ease of electronic test-taking, the CBT TOEFL made a few notable improvements on the paper-based test (PBT); to mention two: (1) it includes linear testing (from easy to difficult) and computer-adaptive testing (tailoring to the proficiency level of the individual test-taker); and (2) it includes a compulsory essay, whose score is factored into the Structure section and is reported in a separate Essay Section, equivalent to the former TWE. A Concordance Table was published in 1998, providing equivalences between the familiar PBT scores and the new CBT ones. Since the CBT is not administered at every site where the PBT was, the PBT continues to be used in various parts of the world. \n\nGraduate School admissions committees have generally used a 550 (=213 CBT) cutoff score, but often without consideration of the total profile of subscores. In light of their near magical aura to the aggregate TOEFL scores, below are some recommendations on the use of TOEFL (either form) for admissions committees:\n\nRegardless of the total score, subscores must be taken into consideration \nListening subscores should not be below 50/16, regardless of the total, aggregate score \nEssay Writing subscores should not be below 4.0 (same rating as TWE scores) \nSince neither PBT nor CBT TOEFL versions measure one’s speaking ability, admissions committees considering offering teaching assistants with teaching duties should not use TOEFL scores alone in such decisions (certainly Listening scores should be a factor) \nThe number of times (and length of intervals) a prospective student has taken the TOEFL should be considered as a factor (read, test-wiseness as an issue) \nDate of last administration and activity in using English since then should be factored in the decision to accept an applicant or not \nFinally, TOEFL scores have never meant to be predictors of academic success. \nReturn to top \nI. Introduction\n\nHaving been developed in the mid 1960’s, the TOEFL has become the major standard of measuring proficiency in English as a second language throughout the world . Because of its widespread use in determining admissions into colleges and universities, TOEFL scores have taken on a sort of magical aura to them. One rather unfortunate consequence is the emergence of innumerable TOEFL preparation courses—not to mention TOEFL preparation centers—throughout the world: the tail is indeed wagging the dog. Even more unfortunate is the temptation to view one’s TOEFL scores as an indicator of general intelligence or as a predictor of academic success, despite the TOEFL Board’s insistence to the contrary. \n\nAlthough the TOEFL Board introduced a computer-based version in 1997 to replace paper-based testing, the latter is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Thus, in general, TOEFL scores in the 310-677 range (paper-based test) are still more familiar than those in the 40-300 range (computer-based test).\n\nLike the paper-based test (PBT), the c	Education & Reference

question_title: ♥What do u mostly do and learn in college? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my humble opinion (and experience), an undergraduate college education is largely the process of training oneself to take the time to retain knowledge.  That's the point of the introductory classes in the first couple years.  They prepare you for the more in-depth major classes and perhaps research in the later years.  Ideally, it's more of training someone in how to learn more than teaching them facts.  \n\nAs far as what you do in college, it's usually a crazy balance f diverse things.  Time for classes, studying (hopefully), extra-curricular involvement, and a social life is hard to manage, but to be a job-attractive graduate, they are all necessary.	Education & Reference
question_title: understanding imagery in poetry? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Using imagery is appealing to 1 (or more) of the 5 senses.  For example:  If I give you the sentence "John is strong", you have an image in your head.  If however, I say "John is as strong as an ox" you have a much more vivid image in your mind because of the comparison that is made.  This is an example of visual imagery but often authors try to appeal to other senses for more effective writing.	Education & Reference

[SEP] best_answer: Everybody is different. People have told me that I wont grow any taller when I was 19 (I was 5'2") Especially since I was girl because girls stop growing at a younger age. But now Im 21 and I grew to 5'5 1/2. I had another growth spurt at around age 20 and grew three inches in one year. Especially after I started eating calcum chews.\n\nI think the key is to take advantage of your growth spurts. Eat more vitamins and calcium supplements. Also since I sleept on a firmer bed I lengthened my back. After a few years of sleeping like this I think It helped out alot.\n\nAnd being as young as you are, your testosterone has yet to kick into full gear! Be paitient and good luck!

question_title: my husband is NOT gay but likes it in the butt why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The organ involved in male ejaculation is the prostrate, which can be stimulated by anal play for men (about four inches in, curve towards his front, but use *lots* of lube!). It develops from the same cells which, in a female foetus, develop into the G-spot, we think.\n\nBeing open to this does *not* make a man gay, and not all gay men enjoy anal play or penetration. There are many nerve endings around the anus and, if people are open-minded enough to try, then they can find play there very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to indulge him, try playing after he's showered, with plenty of lube, gentle at first, and see if you get into it. Some women do. The good sex sites (Good Vibrations, Scarlet Letters and Toys in Babeland for example) will have information if you want it.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What should I do about my 'mother'? [SEP] question_content: My adoptive mother has always had a problem with me. She abused me as a child, and even though I tried to forgive her for it over the years, she has continuously hurt me. She feels that I cannot be happy. She has tried to make me leave the man of my dreams, and when I sent her some ultrasound pictures of our son, she refused everything at the post office. Neither of us have spoken to her since, but what should I do? Should I leave things alone knowing that I'd probably be better off without her, or should I take yet another step to trying to include her in my life? [SEP] best_answer: How sad for you. You need to ask yourself if you and your unborn children are better off without her. If she doesn't show you any love or compassion, then she certainly won't show your children any, which will only hurt you more in the long run. Have you tried calling her and asking her why she would miss the opportunity to be in her grandchildrens lives? If she still refuses to talk to you, chalk it up to God's work and move on without her. What does your Dad have to say about all this? Maybe he could be your "rock" when it comes to dealing with Mom.\nGood Luck and remember you still have your Mother in Law to lean on and show you some support......I know because your story is the same as my daughter in laws and I love her as if she was my own.

(they'll help u w/ the form.) when you n ex go b4 the judge, tell him what you agreed on and as long as it is agreed on by both of you, the judge would have no problem with it. when speaking in front of the judge, state what visitation u have agreed on clearly, and it will be written into an agreement for both of u, n u will each get copies. if you have agreed on a support ammount make sure you tell him that also, and that will be written up too. just remember, they are three diff. things and you need to address them as such.

question_title: Is it possible to think that you are divorced and then find out you really aren't? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend said he was divorced.  Years ago, he had gone to a paralegal and had most of the divorce paper work completed. (I have seen the papers and his child custody agreement.) I found out he was still legally married.  He told me that he looked into it and that he really wasn't divorced because the paralegal didn't file the papers with the judge.  Is this possible?  Is a person stupid to not know if they are divorced or not?  Am I stupid for even wondering? [SEP] best_answer: It's possible, but unlikely.  He is not divorced til those papers are signed, sealed and delivered.  He's been lazy in finding out.  If he has no paperwork, he doesn't care whether he's divorced or not.  Or, he's just lazy.  If he's truly serious about you, he should make sure his divorce is final.  If you have to drive him to the courthouse yourself.\nI was not in a hurry to get the paperwork done, until I knew I was ready to remarry.  Well, that time came and I went to the nearest paralegal and had them get it done in time.  To make sure, I filed them myself.\n\nI hope everything works out for you.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what is love? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: According to Robert Sternberg's research, "Love" is an emotion consisting of three components: intimacy, passion & committment.\n\nIntimacy, the feeling close and connected to someone (developed through sharing and very good communications over time). Intimacy is what makes you want to share and offer emotional and material support to each other.\n-Intimacy alone is Liking (true friendship without passion or long-term commitment)\n\n\nPassion, the feeling physically aroused and attracted to someone. Passion is what makes you feel "in love" and is the feeling most associated with love. It also rises quickly and strongly influences and biases your judgment.\n-Passion alone is Infatuation (passionate, obsessive love at first sight without intimacy or commitment)\n\nCommitment, pledging to your self and each other to strengthen the feelings of love and to actively maintain the relationship. Commitment is what makes you want to be serious, have a serious relationship and promise to be there for the other person if things get tough.\n-Commitment alone is Empty Love (decision to love another without intimacy or passion)\n\nRomantic Love: Intimacy & Passion, no Commitment\n-Lovers physically and emotionally attracted to each other but without commitment\n-“As in a summer romance”\n\nCompanionate Love: Intimacy & Commitment, but no Passion\n-Long-term committed friendships or a marriage in which the passion has faded\n-I love you but I’m not IN love with you\n\nFatuous Love: Passion & Commitment, but no Intimacy\n-Commitment based on passion with without time for intimacy to develop\n-Shallow relationship such as a whirlwind courtship\n\nConsummate Love: A complete love consisting of all three components	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do you manage a job, kids, and keeping the house clean?  Any methods? [SEP] question_content: I have 3 kids, 2,4,10, and work part time.  My house is a disorganized mess!  I try so hard, but I can't seem to keep it clean.  And forget making dinner.  I don't have the energy during the day!  Anyone out there in my situation with a clean house- How?  HELP!! [SEP] best_answer: My apologies. If you wanted a magic elixer to do it all, there isn't any.\n\nThe only tools available to you is discipline, get your 10 yr old to do some housework for pocket money and use your freezer to store some ready meals to pull out, nuke and put on the table.\n\nTidying up is about something that is always happening with kids. Look at what the kids play with and how and work out if a container can be used to improve tidying. For example my sons use two large containers for their Lego and soldiers and scenes. This then puts the responsibility on my boys to put there toys back in the boxes when ever it's needed. Tidying is something that should be done in a "bit here, bit there" as this is far more efficient and better appearance than leaving things and then have a large mess to clean.\n\nCleaning needs another method of "divide and conquer". Divide your house up into areas that then are completed at certain times during your week with areas like the kitchen bench completed at the begining of a cleaning session. Get yourself some labour saving devices as well to speed things up. We have 14 clothes backets, 2 or 3 spares in the laundry ready to go. One maybe for the top of the clothes hamper to stop clothes overflowing. One maybe two beside the washing machine for when washing day arrives. Clothes come off the clothes line then the folding, ironing, putting away might be a little while so their stacked and stored. Even when they are given to the kids to put away, if the kids forget or your not on top of it you limit the mess. Even putting big toys in them in the kids rooms.\n\nA dinner ready to go is about cooking your food at a time when things are easy. Examples are cooking the sauce of Spagetti Bolonaise then cool and freezing it. Buy angel hair spagetti which cooks the quickest and drag out the sauce, put it through the microwave ta-dah. There are lots of these and if you have a Croc-Pot you can load it with meat and vegies in the morning and serve with bread rolls at dinner. The very nice people in the recipe answer forum could roll out some for you as well.\n\nAs for you not having energy, would that mean your continually tired, go and see your doc about it and make sure about plenty of sleep, food and a multivitamin.\n\nHope this helps.

question_title: why do barbershops have that blue and red circulating symbol outside? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "The modern barber pole originated in the days when bloodletting was one of the principal duties of the barber.  The two spiral ribbons painted around the pole represent the two long bandages, one twisted around the arm before bleeding, and the other used to bind is afterward.  Originally, when not in use, the pole with a bandage wound around it, so that both might be together when needed, was hung at the door as a sign.  But later, for convenience, instead of hanging out the original pole, another one was painted in imitation of it and given a permanent place on the outside of the shop.  This was the beginning of the modern barber pole."	Society & Culture
question_title: Why is it that people use profane words when they talk? And what do some of these words mean anyway? [SEP] question_content: For example, the F"-word, the B-word, the A-word, the Sh-word??? [SEP] best_answer: The individuals that use such words feel that this is the only way they can get people to understand them.  Many use it as a way of letting off steam, but all it does is give an adverse opinion of the user and sums up their capacity to communicate.  As far as their meanings, there are many but you can bet that those making use of said words do not know their exact meaning but just their twisted definition.	Society & Culture
question_title: In what states can gays and lesbians get married? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't think any state does. I think it's a federal law that they can't. Some states however can get civil unions.\n\nMy opinion is that not allowing gays and lesbians to be married is steping on our constitutional rights. The only way they can justify why they can't get married is what. Due to thier beliefs that it should only be man and woman. I'm sorry but this sounds like a religious view to me; and in the U.S. we have freedom of religion. We also have Seperation of church and state, so what is thier reason for this.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why is it that religious folk seem bent on 'saving' us gay people? [SEP] question_content: why do they not understand that God put each of us here for a reason, and just because you dont know that reason, you think you should 'rescue' us?\nWhy are they so high on thier horse that they have to 'teach us' the right way to be? Did they never stop to think that perhaps God put US here to teach THEM?????\ntolerance and loving one another was what  Jesus taught his whole life.\nThink about it. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know...maybe they see us as a softer target for 'saving' than say a devout muslim or hindu.\n There are so many things in the bible that are conveniantly ignored by the bible-thumping folks...like the sin of eating of shellfish, the 'good' things about slavery, the not having short hair etc.\n\nThey just pick and choose what they want to follow from the bible.. and insist on trying to control our lives with their misguided morals.\n\nIt just makes me sick the way they like to quite neatly put us in the same box as murderers, pedophiles and rapists.\nBecause these criminals 'love' their victims....\nDon't you get it you narrow-minded fools....these crimes of murder, child abuse and rape all involve one consenting person and one VICTIM.\n\nGay/lesbian relationships consist of TWO CONSENTING adults, loving or having consensual sexual relations with eachother.\n\nHow could an all knowing God punish people for loving eachother.\nShouldnt God be frowning upon you these bigoted bible-thumpers for not loving their neighbours?

question_title: If really there is God, why not God click His hand to combine all religion to give peace a chance? [SEP] question_content: How come we say a loving God if He leave His people killing each other ... leaving some people to starve while others have too much to waste. What God's power for? Is God a sadist? Then religion say ... it's people's fault of having no faith in God! Blessed are the poor & suffering for they have place in heaven. A graceful exit without any basis by moving social feeling and consolation. \n-\nNow, is it a choice to be born in Africa ... or in the rich countries? The answer is nope! Is it a choice to be a christian or muslim? Nope! Every one has no religion from our mother womb. It so happened in the environment of our upbringing. It's unimaginable to become a Pope if one was born from the hinterland of Afghanistan. And to be Osama, if one is born from pius christian family in Rome. [SEP] best_answer: God doesn't leave people to kill each other, unless they choose to.  God did not make man a robot but a creature who can choose right or wrong.  He doesn't want people to starve but many starving nations do not believe in Him, nor call on Him for intervention.  However, missionaries are going into those places and doing a good work.  Others who are Christians and being tortured are victims of an evil power over them in the form of govt.  They are martyrs for their faith.  Many of us have prayed for our brothers and sisters in Sudan for years and we see our prayers answered.  Other Christians have gone in and rescued those being tortured as slaves by the govt.  They are receiving help.  It doesn't matter where you are born, you can always chose to believe in God.  God knows us even before we are designed in our mother's womb.  I came from a non-christian home but I chose to follow after Him, seek Him, serve Him.  I am not exempt from trials, persecution and sorrows of life but I have divine joy and peace because of the hope He brings me.  It is all a matter of faith.  Either believe or not believe.  I'm one who says there are vast rewards to having faith where there is otherwise total hopelessness.  Press on!	Society & Culture

question_title: what kind of body will the raptured people have in Jesus' Millenium reign on earth? Is it a glorified body? [SEP] question_content: What about those not raptured but saved during the Tribulaton--what kind of body will they have--any different?? Bible verses?? [SEP] best_answer: The raptured and resurrected saints will be given their own bodies, but our bodies will be perfected.  (1 Cor. 15:42-45 and 50-56.)\n\nThose who are saved during the Tribulation, and live through it, will keep their bodies and live for at least 1,000 years. A wicked person born after the Tribulation (during the Millenial Reign) will die before they're 100 years old.  See Isaiah 65:20.\n\nThose who die during the Tribulation, after having been saved, will also have their own perfected human bodies.\n\nThere are several references to the "perfected body" teaching, but our primary example is ALWAYS Jesus Christ.  We are taught our resurrection will be the same as His; we also know He was resurrected bodily and looked the same as He did during life.  The account of the Transfiguration (before His death) is a good example; read also the account of His appearance to Thomas.\n\nI hope this helps.  Peace.	Society & Culture

question_title: did you hear about that study that did a double blind test on the effectiveness of prayer on heart surgery? [SEP] question_content: patients. it found that people who were prayed for did no better then people who weren't. but oddly enough people who were prayed for and then told that they were prayed for did worse. [SEP] best_answer: An interesting study. I think there might have been an element of stress with the people who knew they would be prayed for - like performance anxiety - and stress can adversely affect heart patients. \n\nThe study you refer to was about church groups praying for strangers in hospitals, and there's a general consensus that this type of prayer has no effect whatsoever. But there seems to be a psychological benefit in well wishes from people we know - like a virtual hug - and most of us respond well to that.	Society & Culture
question_title: Is there a group of Catholics that wear clothing that looks a little like the KKK attire?

Who are they and why do they wear those? [SEP] best_answer: I don't remember the reason why the robes which look similar to ones worn by the KKK are use, although I am 90% sure it is to ensure the modesty of the pious. \n\nThose who do this live in spain, the robes are worn during holy week.

question_title: Christians, what do you think about these Atheists comments? [SEP] question_content: Reading the Bible is the fastest way out of believing in god. \n\nAthiesim tends to come through STUDY and THOUGHT, rather than a BLIND BELIEF system.\n\n\n  Atheists question what they don't understand, instead of blindly following others like sheep.  \n\nUs Atheists actually take time to research our beliefs instead of allowing someone in a church or anywhere else to tell us what to believe \n\nmost christians are only told about the happy fluffy benevolent god. While us atheists have looked at it ourselves and seen god for what he relay is a violent, racist, sexist, petty, jealous fictional character. Say no to jesus \n\nMost athiests have read their way out of xtianity. SO they obvioulsy know more about the bible than the typical xtian, who hasnt ever read thier bible all the way through even once, let alone the ten times or so I have.

question_title: I do not understand how Muslims think the New Testament is corrupted but some believe some of it? [SEP] question_content: I read Muslims say the New Testament is corrupted, but then they also say that Christians have lost the way: Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life": notice the I AM there.  So how have Christians lost the way, and Why would God allow his word to be corrupted; or do you mean that it is misinterpreted, so much of it is clear that it could not be misinterpreted.  There is large agreement between Jews and Christians on the Old Testament, is this also true for Muslims; I think it is because a Muslim asked me if I read the book Ezekiel, so I went back and re-read it.  And I am sure they believe in the accuracy of Genesis because much of it is copied out in the Quran, even more detail is given on some stories of Genesis, which may be inaccurate details.\n\nSolution: we need to see how much we agree at least.  There are many misunderstanding on ethical values.  I agree for instance that it is wrong to make an image of the prophets, or anything; but not all Christians understand that [SEP] best_answer: I believe the content of New Testament is the revelations from Allah to us\n\nRevelation 22:7,10,13,19 \n“Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.” \nHe said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand"\n"I am the Alef and the Tav, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."\n "If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. "\nالأصحَاحُ الْحَادِي وَالْعِشْرُونَ\n«هَا أَنَا آتِي سَرِيعًا. طُوبَى لِمَنْ يَحْفَظُ أَقْوَالَ نُبُوَّةِ هذَا الْكِتَابِ»\nوَقَالَ لِي:«لاَ تَخْتِمْ عَلَى أَقْوَالِ نُبُوَّةِ هذَا الْكِتَابِ، لأَنَّ الْوَقْتَ قَرِيبٌ.\nأَنَا الأَلِفُ وَالْيَاءُ، الْبِدَايَةُ وَالنِّهَايَةُ، الأَوَّلُ وَالآخِرُ».\nوَإِنْ كَانَ أَحَدٌ يَحْذِفُ مِنْ أَقْوَالِ كِتَابِ هذِهِ النُّبُوَّةِ، يَحْذِفُ اللهُ نَصِيبَهُ مِنْ سِفْرِ الْحَيَاةِ، وَمِنَ الْمَدِينَةِ الْمُقَدَّسَةِ، وَمِنَ الْمَكْتُوبِ فِي هذَا الْكِتَابِ.\nFor Christians, Don't you ever doubt the Revelation of Allah written in your Bible eventhough you are insulted for trusting it.

question_title: Why do people believe in a afterlife now more than any time in history? [SEP] question_content: I was watching a show on the science channel last night that was studying near death experiences.\n\nBut they were saying more people now than any other time in history believe in the afterlife.\n\nWhy do you think this is considering we live during the technological age and know so must about everything? [SEP] best_answer: That is the misconception. Since the beginning of time people have always believed in the after life. Now, we are just more free to express. In ancient times some countrys considered it to be forbidden to speak of any such thing. Some felt if u spoke of the after life u were possessed or a witch or just 2 fries short of a happy meal. Some believe it just gives others something to believe in and makes losing someone easier to deal with. I personally believe that we all have a place to go to whether it be heaven or hell.

question_title: Is there a spouse for every person on Earth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you go strictly by one-man-one woman -- no.\nIn the overall human population, women outnumber men by a small percentage (about 52% to 48%).  That leaves a few million women out in the cold when it comes to husbands.\n\nThe higher ratio of women to men has been around ever since there have been humans (we all start out as female after conception, it takes a specific genetic and hormonal "kick" to make a male) -- it's one reason plural marriage (polygamy) was the rule in ancient cultures, it allowed all the women in a social group to have husbands.

If I had made a stink out of it and got the police involved, I more than likely would have been subjected to it again.

If we did that to black it would be considered racist.  What is the purpose of BET (Black Entertainment Television)?  If we had a WET (White Entertainment Television) channel, it would be racist.....what a crock. [SEP] best_answer: Many African Americans are prejudiced.  I lived in Cincinnati for three years and noticed a disturbing trend of many black people blaming their problems on white people.  \n\nI agree with what you stated about there being all types of "black-oriented" channels and clubs that specifically target, and refer to, their people; this is a great example of a double standard.  I have noticed the same thing with other races having exclusitivity in regards to organizations: Asian and Hispanic television stations and social clubs for example. If there was anything that referred to white people, it would definitely be considered racist.  We have the liberal, PC-minded spineless masses to thank for not standing up for OUR rights. Amen!

question_title: From oregon to cali? [SEP] question_content: I was in a accident on the I-5 in oregon. My wife fell asleep at the wheel. Now i got rushed to the er because i had glass all over my face, the nurses cleaned me up and said i was good to go and checked me out, I came home and found a piece of glass still lodged in my head, and another still in my lip now my question is do i have grounds for a lawsuit against the hospital for not removing the glass from my head, btw the glass is located just above my eye, and in the inside of my lip that was the most horrible day of my life. and whats worse is that they just didnt even fix me now i am being charged 500 dollars for the doctor in san diego to take that out, because my insurance doesnt cover it. so i am just curious because i feel that the first hospital should cover my bill for not doing their job. [SEP] best_answer: Have the hospital submit the bill to your auto insurance carrier (your wife's if it's different). It is still the same accident. And while you could sue the hospital for not getting the glass out I'm fairly sure you wouldn't win. Think about it - your face was covered in blood and glass is clear. They probably couldn't see the glass for the blood and swelling. Just be glad that enough people can pay for health care and insurance (you included if you pay for these things) so that there was someone available to take you to the hospital, check your injuries and then a hospital with a doctor on staff who could treat your injuries. Not every country has such care. \n\nI'm not an advocate of biting the hand that feeds you - on in this case, the hand that treated you.	Politics & Government

But this test is incredibly hard. The army has lower standards for new active duty recruits. What the deal? [SEP] best_answer: OK Check this out, 4 year scholarships are for some unknown reason hard to get, probably because everyone applies for them right out of high school and because of that they can raise their standards to whatever they want.\n\n2 and 3 year scholarships are given out by the PMS (professor of Military Science) a LTC at each school.  So go to college, take the first year ROTC classes and you WILL get a 3 year scholarship.\n\nIf you are in it for the money you can do what I did and enlist in the National Guard and get a 2 year scholarship in the SMP Program (simultaneous membership program).  There is a chance you will deploy during the first 2 years but when you become a Scholarship Cadet you can not be deployed but the gives you more college money than the 3 year scholarship (or did when I went to school)	Politics & Government

In other words, they can add years to a sentence for alleging their priors, same type crimes, and frequency of crimes.  \n\nBasically, the dad is a REPEAT OFFENDER and will be subject to the court designating it as aggravated assault with multiple priors.  \n\nI am sorry to say, dad is looking at a few years in the State Penitentiary, not just local county jail. Good luck with the baby and I hope things work out well for you both.	Politics & Government

question_title: Do you think globalization is at risk as the West has second thoughts? [SEP] question_content: I saw today that Democrats are saying they might need to 'revisit' the idea of free trade agreements, and I know I sure no longer think globalism is an automatic good, as I had assumed it to be.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nhttp://www.globalenvision.org/library/8/1266/1/ [SEP] best_answer: The reality is that globalization is a positive for all players involved.  Right now, the rich countries are enjoying all the benefits without taking any of the risks and globablization does not benefit every single person anyway.  The concept is that if country A can make everything cheaper than country B, both countries can benefit by letting each do what it does best.  A may pay more to B for some things than they could make it themselves for, but A will make more money by selling other products to B.  B makes money, both by selling its goods and by purchasing A's products.  The down side is that each country must focus on its specialty and re-deploy resources from industries where it doesn't have a significant advantage.  That means that you really shouldn't be making clothes or growing wheat in N. America or Europe.  That is something that can be done better in S. America and Africa, freeing up American and European capital and labor to focus on industries where it has an overwhelming advantage.  But if you are a farmer or work in a clothing factory, you probably see if differently.	Politics & Government

question_title: do you think World War III will be coming soon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: yes...Look people the next big one will start with nukes going off at the same time in Tel Aviv, NY, DC, and London. That will be from Iran's Hamas, next will be freighters in all of the US shipping ports having nukes in lead shielded boxes in the fuel oil tanks of merchant ships. That will effectively take the US completely out of it in the first 30mins of WW3 Now after that North Korea will take South Korea and China will take Japan and as much of Russia as possible. Europe will wisely sue for peace with China as the new World Super power. After things calm down a bit negotiations between the EU and China will take place. The former US will be divided up between the two based upon the premise that France will not nuke what is left. During these negotiations the EU and China will also plan a lightning take over of the middle east which will also be divided up between the two powers. When all is said and done there will be peace and technological progress unheard of before.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is the president in Washington D.C and not in any other city? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The President's Residence (first called the White House by Teddy Roosevelt) was placed in Washington, D.C. because of a deal made when the US was very young...\n\nAs I understand it, originally the two major candidates for the Capitol City of the new Republic were Philadelphia (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) and New York City (which was - and is - our largest city) - both in the North. At the same time, there was a problem concerning the war debts the Thirteen States had (remember, they considered themselves 13 COUNTRIES back then). So a deal was struck: in exchange for the rich states allowing national "assumption" of the war debt (and so helping the poorer states out), they would move the Capitol to a (then) brand new location in the South, on the Potomac River.

[SEP] best_answer: An "A" school is sort of like a general knowledge school for a given skill/category. It gets you started in the profession you are in. After that, one is able to apply for a "C" school, a more specialized school. A schools give you the starting knowledge and classes to get you moving, so to speak.\n\nAs to becoming a Gunny..I have no firsthand knowledge of that .	Politics & Government
question_title: are bail bondsmen archaic and should they be eliminated from the criminal justice system? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think we need them because most people that use them have to put up most of what they own to get out of jail and if the person want to try and flee the bail bondsmen have bounty hunters that will go after them at no cost to the tax payers,  it is less of a problem the police are over worked and short handed as it is so it can be hard for them to go after someone not that the don't try.  but it helps out the police because there are people actively hunting the guy that fled.  Most officers that recover a fugitive end up not knowing they have the person until they check there id with dispatch.  so it is a great help in recovering people that have fled.  Also by being able to bail out of jail a person is better able to actively work on there case.	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: Again i ran into this quest., b/c the politics book failed to define what exactly amounts to private sales of handguns?? i am guessing like criminals selling guns online or something??

This practice is still in force here in Ohio. I am a collector and buy privates sales occasionally. the risk is if it turns out to be a stolen guns you can't get your kinkies back....

question_title: In a legal case, say, A Company V. B Corp.,does that imply A wins the case? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The order of the parties in case reporting is quite a complex question.\nUsually for the trial level case the party listed first if the party bringing a legal motion and the party listed second is the one defending.\n\nThe same is often true for the appeal level cases, The party who lost on the trial level and is now bringing a motion to appeal, is listed first. This leads to interesting namings:\nSay A sued B (case is called A v. B)\nSay A won and B appealed the case to the Court of Appeals -- now the case is called B v. A. \nSay the court of appeals reversed and held that B wins. Now A appeals the case to the Supreme court -- now the case is A v. B again.\n\nHowever there are weird cases -- when the party that won appeals the case (say because they think that the damages are inadequate)\nOr when both parties appeal the decision.\n\nIn cases like this each court has it's own policies.

[SEP] question_content: I was talking with my uncle and he seems to think that the American sensibility doesn't really place much interest on children, education or the elderly. Agree or disagree? And for you ultra-conservative narrow-minded idiots get a life. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think the government needs to be in the business of telling people how to rear their children.....or educating them, for that matter.  I believe that is one reason our public (government run) schools are so bad today.  The other reason is that people do not know how to discipline their babies.  They either them them run wild or they yell at the to shut the f**k up. This is beginning to really get out of hand when children are having babies.  The fathers are many times no where around.   Who suffers?  The child.\n\nThe elderly pay into the medicare system their whole life and when they need help caring for themselves, we "shelve" them in a nursing home.  Some, but not all,  of these places are nasty and the staff is mean.  A senior either has to be wealthy and pay for private care, have excellent long term care insurance, or apply for medicare.  I have never understood why we treat our elderly worse than animals.\n\n\n\n\nArmygirl91--remember you will be old one day.	Politics & Government

question_title: How do you put in a new string in a squire telecaster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Take a replacement string of the same gauge (thickness) and push it through the spare hole at the end of the metal bridge plate. Pull through until the stopper blocks it moving any further and then feed the end through the tuner peg hole. Ensure that the string is aligned into the groove at the end of the neck and allow some slack into the string before tightening - about enough to get a finger between the string and the fretboard. Tighten the string around the pole using the tuning peg - I tend to wrap it once above the string then the remaining times below. Tune up, then stretch the string by placing your palm over it near the lower frets and pulling the string gently away from the fretboard with your playing hand. Tune up again, repeat the process, then plug in and rock out!	Entertainment & Music
question_title: Does anyone know any jokes or even riddles? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: An old guy walks into a bar and asks for a bottle of forty-year old Scotch. The bartender, not wanting to give up the good liquor, pours a shot of ten-year Scotch and figures that the guy won't be able to tell the difference. The guy downs the Scotch and says: "This Scotch is only ten years old! I specifically asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nAmazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar and pulls out a bottle of twenty-year old Scotch and pours the man a shot. The guy drinks it down and says, "That was twenty-year old Scotch. I asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nSo the bartender goes into the back room and brings out a bottle of thirty-year old Scotch and pours the guy a drink. By now a small crowd has gathered around the man and is watching anxiously as he downs the latest drink. Once again the guy states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original request for forty-year old Scotch. \n\nThe bartender can hold off no longer and disappears into the cellar to get a bottle of prime forty-year old Scotch. Soon, the bartender returns with the bottle and pours a shot. The guy downs the Scotch and says, "Now this is forty-year old Scotch!" The crowd applauds his discriminating palate. \n\nAn old drunk who had been watching the proceedings with interest, raises a full shot glass of his own and says, "Here, take a swig of this." \n\nThe guy takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow. Immediately, he chokes and spits out the liquid on the barroom floor. "My God! That tastes like piss," he yells. \n\n"Great guess," says the drunk. "Now, how old am I?"	Entertainment & Music

Even though I love the Use Your Illusions, I'm still mad at Axl for moving away from the "I'll Kick Your Ass" hard rock of Appetite for Destruction. He has been promising an album for ten years, but he never does release anything. I admire the man as a lyricist, musician, and a vocalist.

question_title: Which do you prefer Yahoo or Google? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends for what purpose. Overall, I think one needs to assess what it is that they want. I think yahoo for e-mail purposes is extremely user friendly and I like the new BETA format that e-mails can be viewed and accessed in. I am able to organize my e-mails and my spam for that matter alphabetically in yahoo and can just select several e-mails at once to delete or easily drag e-mails into folders. I also like that yahoo has made it really easy to compose e-mails. As you start to type someone's name, yahoo will automatically narrow down the possibilities of who you are trying to e-mail and bring up a drop down menu of names you can select. On google, I like the fact that I can chat directly within gmail. I also like the fact that my instant message exchanges are automatically saved on gmail. Overall, I think the searching is more extensive on google. It really just depends on what you want to use them for. Good luck!	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] best_answer: DO NOT if yo like to have a happy long lasting marriage DO NOT DO IT... \nyou are going to marry and you have to know what that means... it is not all about sex and fun....\nThe true marriage is this, that husband and wife should be united both physically and spiritually, that they may ever improve the spiritual life of each other, and may enjoy everlasting unity throughout all the worlds of God."\n\nThe love between husband and wife should not be purely physical, nay rather it must be spiritual and heavenly. These two souls should be considered as one soul. How difficult it would be to divide a single soul!"\n\n\nThe Lord, peerless is He, hath made woman and man to abide with each other in the closest companionship, and to be even as a single soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate friends, who should be concerned about the welfare of each other. If they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine grace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven."

question_title: dashweiler, sorry for the mispelling. I know ther isn't anything I can do to force her,but any advice helps me [SEP] question_content: I had an internship at Butte County Mental Health and asked all the questions I could. They just told me to basically do anything to get her in. I don't want to wait until she hurts herself. She moved out and took all of my belongings. I was trying to help her, my family sent her up here for me to deal with, after I had just lost my 5 1/2 year old daughter that she and I both were in our car and got hit by a drunken driver. He didn't serve any time, just has to go to DUI classes and tell his story as a disciplinary action towards him. I just didn't see any remorse from him when he said sorry to me. I have to grieve over the loss of the love of my life and then my sister is sent to me because they know that I have a big heart and won't give up. But I don't know what else to do but file a police report. What should I do dashweiler. I miss her, but she drives me crazy with the way she acts. My mom was murdered when I was twelve, and would not want me to give up on my sister. Now i'm cryin [SEP] best_answer: once you file a police report, an ATL (attempt to locate) bulletin will go out for her, and if she is an adult once the police (or someone who knows they are looking for her) finds her then the most they can do is a welfare check to make sure she is not a risk to harm herself or others. if they see that she is based on any actions by her or on the info they have from you, they will take her to a facility to be evaluated and the doctors there will determine whether or not to commit her.

HOWEVER... some seizures may look like tremors, so if you are having petit mal seizures and think they are tremors, a grand mal seizure may eventually happen.\n\nFind a neurologist to evaluate the tremor.  It may be early Parkinsons, which can be treated with medication.  Some severe essential tremors (they're just there, we don't know what is causing it) can be treated surgically.\n\nIf you are, in fact, having seizures, those need to be treated with medication.\n\nGood luck	Health
question_title: Is it bad to stay up for two or more days at a time? [SEP] question_content: This is without being drug induced also... I am not talking about your crank addict.  \n\nI simply got a graveyard job and am going to school and have a very small social life... anyway are there long term drawbacks or health problems assoiciated with not getting enough sleep? [SEP] best_answer: Everyones sleep pattern is different: People who are 'Larks' are up before the sun, yet half asleep around 9pm. Those who are 'Owls' are the life and soul of the party well into the early hours, but are like the living dead if forced to get out of bed before 11am or later. Some people need a lot of sleep, while others can manage on 3 or 4 hours. There really is no good or bad concerning sleep. Provided no drugs are used, and you feel all right, your body and mind will let you know when to sleep and when to be awake.	Health
question_title: Is 125 pounds normal for a 5'1'' tall 22-year old girl? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "A recommended weight according to height is the wrong answer. Thats right weight is extremely overrated. It's about your muscle to fat ratio. What matters is keeping your body fat percentage under about 35% for a woman and 25% for a guy. \nWhy? Muscle weighs more than fat. If your body composition is 80% muscle then you may possibly weigh more than the recommended weight. This doesn't mean you are overweight, and it certainly doesn't mean you are unhealthy. \n\nI am an example of that, I am 6'6 250 lbs with 13% body fat (good for a guy). According to the charts I'm overweight, but if you see me you would guess I am about 200 lbs. Thats what muscle mass does it makes you look a lot smaller than what you weigh.\n\nThink of this a muscle cell is a thick dense heavy rubber band.\nThink of a fat cell as a water balloon that can shrink or expand with no limit as to how big it can be.\n\nThe water balloon would take up way more space than rubber bands, but wouldn't weight as much. This is how people can look small but if they are muscular they could weigh more. \n\nIn truth the height and weight chart was something created in the 1950's and it was based on a 150lb person who was sedentary and lived near the equator. Which means its relevance to most Americans is none. Trust the BMI ratio more, which is the ratio of muscle to fat, that gives a more accurate measurement of how much weight is appropriate for you. \n\n\nBMI indicates your health risks by comparing your height and weight. Males with a BMI above 27.8 and women over 27.3 are considered overweight. Males with a BMI less than 20.7 and women below 19.1 are classified as underweight.\n\nThere are limitations to BMI so it's important to realize that it is only an estimation of body fat. People who have valid reasons for maintaining weight outside of normal ranges (pregnant or breast feeding women, competitive athletes, body builders and people who are chronically ill) may experience inaccurate BMI values. People with a high percentage of muscle mass may appear overweight using BMI because muscle is more dense than fat.\n\nHere is a link to calculate your BMI: http://apexfitness.com/html/tools/fit_calc/bmi/ "	Health

I suggest you ask your doctor for a referral to a Physical Therapist.

Your doctor can also obtain spinal x-rays which can help to determine the severity.	Health
question_title: sleeping problems? [SEP] question_content: i have a problem with getting a recouperative sleep. i sleep alot, on weekends i can sleep for 12 hrs one day and then not at all for the next 3 days.. and im always tired in the day time.. is there any reason for this or am i just being a domber azzel? [SEP] best_answer: I don't normally promote products but in this case, I believe it might benefit you. It is not a pill or any consumable product. In fact, it's an ebook called, Powerful Sleep. I am only recommending the book because it's from a legitimate author and has worked very well for several people who have visited my website (which is about men's fitness). \n\nLet me explain what the book is about and why it might be worth considering. It is written by Kacper Postawski, a sleep science researcher. He studied insomnia to try to find a cure for this very common and life-disrupting problem. During the course of his research, he made some intriguing discoveries about why some people sleep 8, 10, 12 hours a day and still feel tired and why oversleeping like this is actually bad for you. \n\nHe points out in his book that controlling sleep quality, sleep cycles, light-dark cycles, circadian rhythms and lifestyle factors (exercise, stress, light exposure, drugs, alcohol, caffeine, etc.), are possibly more important than the quantity of sleep itself. In other words, it's not so important that you get "X" amount of sleep per night as it is to get quality sleep per night. In his book, he reveals information on psychological "triggers" and simple techniques that will help you fall asleep instantly, sleep soundly and wake up energized - automatically. \n\nPeople who have read the book have told me that they actually get less sleep than they did before and yet they feel more awake and energized. The reason is because they are getting quality sleep for the first time. Just because you get 8+ hours of sleep does not mean those are quality hours of sleep. Most people can get the quality of sleep they need with as little as 5 or 6 hours. This book explains how that is possible and teaches you how to get the quality sleep you need.\n\nKacper also points out that for some people they truly do need 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is an individual matter and in this book, he shows you how to determine what your ideal sleep time is and how to get that quality sleep every night.\n\nIf you're curious about the book at all, visit his website (link provided below), and you'll get the first two chapters of the book for free. All you have to do is answer the question on the home page and then the first two chapters are emailed to you instantly. You'll be able to tell after reading the first two chapters if it's right for you or not. Good luck to you!\n\nTravis	Health
question_title: gas and bloating relief? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: OK -- the bloating is not in your stomach, which is where the simethicone helps.  Instead, the bloating is in the intestines, which could be 1 of several things.  For me, it was too much carbonation.  I drank 3-4 cokes a day.  By knocking soda out of my life, gas and bloating are pretty much gone.  It could also be iron supplements, lactose intolerance, or gluten intolerance.  I suggest you try 1 week elimination diets ... no soda for a week, etc. ... and find the culprit.  Last resort, it could be IBS, but only after a doctor checks you out.	Health

question_title: what is the best way to get a first time morgage that is afortable? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am actually a mortgage consultant. You can goto my site if you would like, and enter your info, and I can email you with any info. But for now, to make a mortgage affordable, put down as much as you can. The more down, the less the payments will be. Most people cannot put down 20% these days, which is fine. It is very common to do two mortgages, one for 80% of the sale price, and then another for the rest minus down payment, using two over one that is more than 80% removes PMI, which is Private mortgage insurance, which is almost always required for a loan above 80% of the value of the home. Also, with an adjustable rate mortgage, like a 3/1, which means the rate is fixed for 3 years at a low rate and then can fluxuate once a year after that, that is good for first time buyers. Or even a 5/1 , working the same way. That way, you get a lower rate, and if you move within 5 years great, whihc is the average for first time home buyers, and if you decide to stay, you can always refinance, when the rates are low again. If you want some more information, just goto my site, and I will email you back. In the box down the bottom, make sure you let me know that you got the link from here. I cannot help in all states, but I can def. help you out informationally.	Business & Finance
question_title: Do you think high quality,large,well cut diamonds are a good investment??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, diamonds are not a good investment if you plan to buy an "investment grade" diamond, and lock it away in a dark safe deposit box. First of all, you are investing in a commodity that is controlled by a benevolent dictator (monopoly) in a foreign land. I'm talking of course about Debeers company that controls the price and distribution of over 80% of the world's diamonds. There is no free market price at the source of diamonds. Debeers sets the price and controls the quantity of diamonds available. No one knows how many diamonds are stored in Debeers' vaults.\n\nPeople who buy investment diamonds from a broker, friend or relative usually pay such a high price over true wholesale, that it might to take forever to see any real appreciation; this is especially true for those laymen who believe they really know the four C's and a lot about the diamond market. Wheeling and dealing in diamonds should only be attempted by experienced, professional diamond dealers. Diamonds pay no dividends or interest. My opinion is that diamonds are for wearing, not investing.	Business & Finance

question_title: What happenes if you default on a 401K loan? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you fail to pay your 401k loan, then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution. (Tax + Penalty for early distribution).\n\nThe amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.\n\nFor example.  If you take a 401k loan for $1000, and you have $3000 in your 401k and you quit your job, then the $1000 is deducted from your $3000 leaving you with a $2000 401k total.\n\nThe $1000 is also treated like a "distribution".  In other words, it's treated like an early withdrawal.  So at the end of the year, you owe a 43% penalty on the $1000, or $430 in taxes.  (33% income tax [or whatever your income tax rate is], 10% penalty).\n\nFurther more, since that $1000 is treated like regular income, it may push you into a higher tax bracket.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: I know people who left the country and made good abroad.  I know I can also suceed even if I stay.  With the resources and technology that we have, I can augment my income and improve our living status. [SEP] best_answer: So hard to compare. \n$700/month for a professional like you would be ridiculously low here in the USA, but it is also probably more expensive to live here (housing, food, taxes, insurance, etc...)  \nIt is hard to say what that means in terms of real spending power.

question_title: can you really make money on the internet? [SEP] question_content: So far, I've invested a few hundred dollars and have not made any money.  are reseller accounts good? and affeliate accounts?  i've tried lots of things...nothing works....is anyone doing something that works and is willing to share that info? [SEP] best_answer: First, you have to determine what you want to do on the Web. There are many ways to make money on the Web, and you need to choose the best way - what you can do, what your resources can afford, and what you think is needed. \n\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\n\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\n\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \n\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\n\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or PowerHomeBiz.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\n\na. Advertising - From the article "How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\n\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \n\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \n\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \n\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\n\n3. Sell advertising for your site directly. This is admittedly a more difficult route for a small business site wanting to earn advertising revenues. But hey, as they say: "no pain, no gain!" \n\nb. Affiliate Programs - you sell other people's products that your audience may be interested in; and you get a certain commission after the desired action was done (whether a sale, a lead, subscription to email newsletter, or however this is defined)\n\nc. Paid online content. Hoovers.com or WebmasterWorld.com Supporters forum all require paid subscription before accessing the information\n\nd. Content licensing and syndication. Some publishers such as the Associated Press get paid every time their content is published elsewhere	Business & Finance

question_title: How do you feel about people with HIV? [SEP] question_content: How do you feel about people with HIV? Do you try and understand them, help them, stay away from them? What are your feelings on this. [SEP] best_answer: You know, I think the best way to answer that is to know someone going through it.  For instance, say your sister is your best friend in the world.  Everthing is fine until one day you get a call from her saying that she has be tested positive for HIV.  What's the first thing that will go through your mind?\n\nNow add the fact that the reason she has HIV is because she was in a collision a year or so prior and was injured. She needed a blood transfusion and showed no symptoms.  She and her wonderful husband decide to have a child and as a routine check finds out that she was HIV positive.  Now what do you think?\n\nWell, I think that if the person I've known all my life suddenly came down with a disease like cancer or had a heart attack, I wouldn't stay away from him or her, but try to understand them and help them if they need help.  I also imagine what it would be like not having them in my life just because I stayed away from them knowing they had heart disease.  \n\nYes, I know that things like HIV can be passed on. But seriously, how are they going to pass it on to me?  \n\nIn essence, I think that if someone has HIV, I should treat them as someone who doesn't, as long as I'm not planning on sleeping with them:)\n\nI hope that answered your question. :)	Business & Finance
question_title: How does one deal with companies who buy old debt and try to get you to pay? [SEP] question_content: I have an old credit card account from 6 1/2 years ago that apparently an attorney orgagnization bought the debt and is now trying to collect. I have to question the validity since the original amount was about $1,800 now that are trying to say I owe $10,000. [SEP] best_answer: Dealing with old debt \nBy Lucy Lazarony • Bankrate.com \nDon't let an old debt come back to haunt you. \n\n\nSome debt collectors are unearthing old debts, debts that are five to 10 years old or more, in the hope of squeezing some fresh money out of unsuspecting consumers.\n\n"I had one guy who got a call on a debt 14 years later," says Gerri Detweiler, author of "The Ultimate Credit Handbook."\n\nA collection call on an old debt can be tricky to handle, and if you handle it wrong it could lead to big trouble down the road. \n\nFirst off, it's important to realize that an old unpaid debt can't hurt you nearly as much as a new unpaid debt. \n\n- advertisement - \n \n \nAn unpaid credit account will mar your credit report for seven years. But once your debt passes the seven-year mark, you're in the clear. \n\nWith newer debts, debt collectors may call and threaten to sue you day in and day out. With an older debt, any debt collector that threatens to take you to court is breaking the law.\n\nThat's quite a difference and it all hinges on whether the debt a collector is haranguing you about is beyond the statute of limitations for delinquent debt in your state.\n\nOnce a debt is older than the statute of limitations for debt in your state, a debt collector no longer has the right to sue you for payment. You may still have a moral obligation to pay back the debt, but you can't be sued over it.\n\n"They can still ask you to pay, but they can't threaten to sue. If they do, it's a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act," says John Ventura, a consumer attorney in Brownsville, Texas, and author of the e-book Stop Debt Collectors Cold.\n\nLet's say you still owe some money on an old credit card account left over from your college days, 10 years earlier. And let's say the statute of limitations for credit card accounts in your state is five years. \n\nA debt collector may call you and ask you for payment for this forgotten account, but he can't take you to court or threaten to sue you over it. If he does, he's violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. \n\nAnd since the debt is more than 7 years old, it's no longer listed on your credit report.\n\nWatch your step\n\nEven though a debt collector won't ever admit it, you're the one with the advantage here. But one little misstep could change all that.\n\nIn some states, making a partial payment to a debt collector or even acknowledging that you owe the money is enough to make an old debt new again.\n\nIf this happens, the five-year statute of limitations on your debt starts all over again. A debt collector has five more years in which to sue you for payment. And a non-payment on your new-again debt could be reported on your credit report. Then the advantage transfers to debt collectors.\n\nThe best way to handle a collection call for an old debt is to say as little as possible. Don't agree to pay. Don't acknowledge the debt. \n\nIn her book, "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts," attorney Robin Leonard offers the following advice: \n\n"You should never talk to the collection agency about it at all, even if they call at a permitted hour of the day. Just hang up the phone or put the receiver down and walk away."\n\nThe best way to respond to a collection notice on an old debt is in writing.\n\nUnder the law, a debt collector must send you a written notice telling you the amount of money you owe and the name of the creditor. If within 30 days of receiving this collection notice you write a letter back disputing the debt, a debt collector may not contact you.\n\nIt's a good idea to send this letter via certified mail so you'll have proof that the debt collector received it. Under the law, a collector may only renew collection activities if proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill, is sent to you. \n\n"Definitely seek a	Business & Finance

After the blue screen when the windows is copying files another error occurs which says "A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. Disable or uninstall any anti virus, disk defragmentation or back up utilities. Checkyou hard drive configration and check for any updated drivers.

If you have anything else inside like sound cards or TV capture or anything, remove it temporarily.  Try to re-install XP like that.  If that fails, go into your system BIOS (usually press F2 key right at computer startup time) and select safe defaults for all your BIOS settings.  Reboot and try installation once again.  I assume you are using an original certified copy of Windows XP on CD.  If all this fails, you may very well have something wrong with your motherboard.  It is also possible, though very unlikely, that both your RAM sticks had something happen to them at the same time.  You can get a RAM tester to run from a floppy disk.  See the sources below.

I like this site cuse you can look at the FAQs and see if you really need to reformat. If you have options set not to save, it will not save. Reformatting doesn’t “erase” anything; it just changes the file extensions so that they can’t be found in the conventional way. The only way for files not to be found is to destroy the hard drive itself. Yeah, you can get wipe Disk, that would take care of any spyware, worm or trojan problems.	Computers & Internet
question_title: you guys are my last hope....please help me..i asked this question already..but no answer..there must be sum1? [SEP] question_content: smart enough in the whole of yahoo that can give me  hope that sum1 can help..pullleeezz..To get my previously recorded music from my mini disc to play load and save on my computer?\nwould it be possible to do this with an RCA audio lead and plug it from the mini disc 'out' to my computer ear phone jack? (i would prefere to do it this way if possible due to the fact i have to move the mini disc player from another room which is hooked up thru my amp. but can i just do it the way discribed above.if you suggest going thru my amp would be better...what leads do i use and where do i put them in and out? (i would have to move this also).. if you have any other ideas i would be very grateful. thanks all. [SEP] best_answer: OK... this is called Sound Capture. The way it works is this: you connect an audio lead from the headphone jack socket of your MiniDisc player to the Line In jack socket on your computer's sound card.\n\nYou then start up the "Windows Sound Recorder" program. Find it by going to All Programs > Accessories > Entertainment > Sound Recorder\n\nNow, as a test, start playing a track on your MiniDisc player - the sound should come out of your PC's speakers - make sure your sound is turned on with the volume up.\n\nNow go back to the beginning of the MiniDisc track you want to capture. Click the round red Record button in Windows Sound Recorder, then within a few seconds press Play on your MiniDisc - the capture should begin... and when the MiniDisc track ends and fades out, click the Stop button in Windows Sound Recorder.\n\nNow click File > Save As in Windows Sound Recorder, and save the file as a WAV wherever you like.\n\nThis is the general way of capturing sound. It isn't a transfer of the original digital file, so there may be a small drop in quality, but it will still be good.\n\nPlease post again if you need more detail.\n\nDC :)	Computers & Internet

question_title: csma/cd jam signal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If a collision is heard, both of the senders will send a jam signal over the Ethernet. This jam signal indicates to all other devices on the Ethernet segment that there has been a collision, and they should not send data onto the wire. (A second indication of a collision is the noise created by the collision itself.) \n\nAfter sending the jam signal, each of the senders will wait a random amount of time before beginning the entire process over. The random time helps to ensure that the two devices don't transmit simultaneously again.	Computers & Internet

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The C# Graphics Library (hosted on Sourceforge), has code which wraps the OpenGL Application Programming Interfaces.  Another option is to use "SharpGL", another wrapper written by Dave Kerr and hosted on CodeProject.\n\nIf you wish to create your own wrappers for OpenGL in C#, you will need to use Platform/Invoke to call the API functions that are exported from the GL Dynamic Link Libraries.  This requires using the System.Runtime.InteropServices library and special declarations for the function exports (and parameters) using attributes to declare them.\n\nSeveral of these Platform/Invoke declarations have been provided by the community on the PInvoke.NET Wiki.

question_title: Which MLB stadiums are considered hitters parks? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: espn.com has a link that provides park factors for each season from 2001 to 2005. This is an objective measure and can be broken down by runs, hits, 2b, 3b, HRs or bbs.\n\nPark Factor compares the rate of stats at home vs. the rate of stats on the road.\nA rate higher than 1.000 favors the hitter. Below 1.000 favors the pitcher.\nPF = ((homeRS + homeRA)/(homeG)) / ((roadRS + roadRA)/(roadG))\n\nFor the 2005 season the top 5 hitter ballparks for runs were:\n\n1. Coors field (Rockies)       1.285\n2. Citizens Bank (Phillies)    1.161\n3. Great American (Reds)       1.128\n4. Turner Field(Braves)        1.095\n5.

question_title: i have a shimano deore mega 9 crankset. can i use an xt 8 speed rear mech or does it have to be a 9 speed? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You probably need to repost and clarify a few things-  do you mean crankset (which is the front three gears) or cassette (which is the gearing on the rear wheel, usually 7 - 9 speeds)? Also, by rear mech, do you mean derailleur, or rear cassette?\n\nI can tell you this - when Shimano moved from 8 to 9 speeds they changed the chain, so a 9 speed crankset and an 8 speed cassette might be problematic.\n\nIf you are only worried about your rear derailleur, then you should not have much of a problem - just set your adjustment screws correctly and go.

Look at Dever (Tatum Bell and Mike Anderson) and Kansas City (Priest Holmes and Larry Johnson). Reggie Bush is going to be a great running back and the Texans can't afford to pass up on him.	Sports

question_title: Do you think Jere Lehtinen will win the Frank J. Selke Trophy again? [SEP] question_content: He's won it 3 times before, and he put on an amazing performance again this year, but will they give it to Rod Brind'Amour almost entirely because he was on the team that took home Lord Stanley's cup? Or perhaps you think they'll go the other way with Mike Fisher of the Senators? [SEP] best_answer: I think Brind'Amour will get it simply because of his leadership and play all the way up to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Generally teams that go further in the NHL Playoffs do get a higher look at being given awards.  It's more prestigious for them, they worked harder for it.  And you gotta remember- hockey is a team sport, not an individual sport.  So the better a player's team makes him look- the better chance he also has at winning it.	Sports
