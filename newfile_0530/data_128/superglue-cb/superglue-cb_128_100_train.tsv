[SEP] hypothesis: Meh ' Lindi could attain the full strength of a purestrain Stealer	contradiction

I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh.
