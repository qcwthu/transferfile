premise: B: So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? A: Well, actually, I do n't think they're out of line. [SEP] hypothesis: they're out of line	contradiction
premise: The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland. The two are also signing a trade agreement. South Korean government officials said they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can ``offer experience.'' [SEP] hypothesis: Seoul can loan money to Warsaw	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, A: Um. B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B: and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car. [SEP] hypothesis: the Dodge Omni was a very quality car	contradiction
premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long. [SEP] hypothesis: it was too long	contradiction
premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too. [SEP] hypothesis: Graham was gay too	contradiction
premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better [SEP] hypothesis: it could be better	contradiction
premise: B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere. [SEP] hypothesis: that's done much anywhere	contradiction
premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask. [SEP] hypothesis: Jed should ask	contradiction

I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally. [SEP] hypothesis: she would do it to her parents	contradiction
premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with [SEP] hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with	contradiction
premise: B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out. [SEP] hypothesis: he has used a typewriter to do a report	contradiction
premise: A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know, the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know. [SEP] hypothesis: the police can do it alone	contradiction
premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them? [SEP] hypothesis: people can have power over spirits	contradiction
premise: A: That's fairly interesting. B: I bet that would be, rather interesting. Uh, that's, uh, self improvement, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh. A: Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement. [SEP] hypothesis: she reads anything strictly labeled self improvement	contradiction
premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me. [SEP] hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, [SEP] hypothesis: she would buy a Dodge	contradiction
premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it. [SEP] hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate	contradiction
premise: A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that, [SEP] hypothesis: speaker A could require everyone to do it for a whole year	contradiction
premise: B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them. [SEP] hypothesis: someone in his house knows the difference	contradiction
premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. [SEP] hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it. [SEP] hypothesis: they can really do something to change it	contradiction
premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper? [SEP] hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper	contradiction
premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me.

premise: A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year. [SEP] hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year	contradiction
premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important? [SEP] hypothesis: Maelmuire is important	contradiction
premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way [SEP] hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way	contradiction
premise: A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement. [SEP] hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement	contradiction
premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant. [SEP] hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant	contradiction
premise: A: it was so fattening. B: That sounds good. A: But, I don't think we gained any weight from it [SEP] hypothesis: they gained any weight from it	contradiction
premise: B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A: Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there. [SEP] hypothesis: some of her relatives would really like to go there	contradiction
premise: B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. [SEP] hypothesis: rehabilitation is effective	contradiction
premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done. [SEP] hypothesis: it's done	contradiction
premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. [SEP] hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did	contradiction
premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. [SEP] hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it	contradiction
premise: B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all. B: I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive. [SEP] hypothesis: it was a well thought out incentive	contradiction
premise: A: Yeah, that's crazy. B: and then you come here in the Dallas area, um, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles. [SEP] hypothesis: people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles	contradiction
premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way. [SEP] hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way	contradiction
premise: B: Yeah. Well, that's the guy that counts. A: Yes. But, maybe we'll get your guy. B: Oh, I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time. [SEP] hypothesis: Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time	contradiction
premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently [SEP] hypothesis: somebody roots differently	contradiction
premise: In finding ``good news'' in Berkeley's new freshman admissions plan (``The Privileged Class,'' editorial, Sept. 20), you're reading the headline but not the story. The plan indeed raises from 40% to 50% the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria. But that doesn't mean ``half of the students attending Berkeley'' will be admitted this way. [SEP] hypothesis: half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way	contradiction
premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely. [SEP] hypothesis: she was ever lonely	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out [SEP] hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out	contradiction
premise: B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far, [SEP] hypothesis: it's going to go very far	contradiction
premise: A: And now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them. B: Oh. A: So they're just talk about lowering them but they never do, they just keep raising them. B: I've never seen taxes really go down. [SEP] hypothesis: taxes would really go down	contradiction
premise: A: How did Radio Shack work? B: If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number. And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning, [SEP] hypothesis: they're going to call him	contradiction
premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws. [SEP] hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. [SEP] hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school	contradiction
premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this. [SEP] hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free	contradiction
premise: GM confirmed it received U.S. antitrust clearance to boost its holding. Sansui Electric agreed to sell a 51% stake to Polly Peck of Britain for $110 million. Still, analysts said the accord doesn't suggest Japan is opening up to more foreign takeovers. [SEP] hypothesis: Japan is opening up to more foreign takeovers	contradiction
premise: A: That is the reason, I don't play over there. B: Yeah. A: I like the course, but I don't play over there because, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart. B: Right. A: And, I don't think a cart damages the turf. [SEP] hypothesis: a cart damages the turf	contradiction
premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it. [SEP] hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy	contradiction
premise: B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame [SEP] hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there	contradiction
premise: B: And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. A: Uh-huh.

premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big. [SEP] hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily	contradiction
premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it, [SEP] hypothesis: they've gone that far	contradiction
premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it? [SEP] hypothesis: they had no way of paying	entailment
premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage? [SEP] hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage	entailment
premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring. [SEP] hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring	entailment
premise: A: Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. there's no easy solution for that. B: Uh-huh.  I don't know that there is an easy solution, but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and I'm not sure what it would be. It would be money better spent than, A: Uh-huh. B: do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard? [SEP] hypothesis: it costs more to keep an inmate on death row that it does to send a kid of Harvard	entailment
premise: B: So am I. A: Are you, B: You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you, [SEP] hypothesis: it's kind of coming back around to that	entailment
premise: ``For God's sake keep them in their seats. If we get panic people are going to be crushed to death and there will be mayhem in the car park.''

premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little. [SEP] hypothesis: the paper said very little	entailment

[SEP] hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt	entailment
premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong. [SEP] hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots	entailment
premise: ``Molly likes having an audience for her tales and it passes the hours for them.'' When Miss Louisa had a second more severe stroke at the end of August, and Miss Ellen another heart attack, both old ladies died within a few days of each other. Their friends could only feel that death was merciful in the circumstances especially with war imminent and that Molly had made the closing months of their lives very happy. [SEP] hypothesis: death was merciful in the circumstances	entailment
premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to? [SEP] hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin	entailment
premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration.

premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible. [SEP] hypothesis: Everett was missing	entailment
premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission. [SEP] hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual	entailment
premise: A: I am right outside Baltimore. I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line. B: Um. A: And I go to a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house. So I'm actually in Baltimore, yeah, you could say I'm in Baltimore. [SEP] hypothesis: he is in Baltimore	entailment
premise: I spent just over an hour with Patterson which, I found out later, turned out to be another first. Time is money in the City and few people are worth an hour unless it's over lunch and only then if you're involved in a takeover bid. It was also I learned one of the few occasions anyone at PKB could remember that Patterson had a meeting with his door shut and nobody got fired. [SEP] hypothesis: Patterson had a meeting with his door shut and nobody got fired	entailment

premise: A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also.
