Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways.

But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it. [SEP] hypothesis: she really enjoys it	contradiction
premise: B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know.

premise: B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work. [SEP] hypothesis: that is going to work	contradiction
premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion.

premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.

I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. [SEP] hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked	contradiction
premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it.

premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her. [SEP] hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother	contradiction
premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this.

[SEP] hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly	contradiction

How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change. [SEP] hypothesis: the law will change	contradiction

The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef...

premise: His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s.

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right.
