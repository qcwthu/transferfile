premise: Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect. Perhaps I will convey a better idea of the tone of those evenings if I say that regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers and Mr John Donalds valet to Mr Sydney Dickenson. [SEP] hypothesis: regular visitors included the likes of Mr Harry Graham valet-butler to Sir James Chambers	entailment
premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all.

premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate.

[SEP] hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots	entailment

[SEP] hypothesis: Sara might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year	entailment
premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat. [SEP] hypothesis: this was Tina's mother	entailment

premise: Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.  According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.

[SEP] hypothesis: Willie was there	entailment
premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist.

premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether.
