A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. [SEP] hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it	contradiction
premise: B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them. [SEP] hypothesis: someone in his house knows the difference	contradiction

A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war. I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out [SEP] hypothesis: they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out	contradiction
premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them. [SEP] hypothesis: it was Edward's fault	contradiction
premise: A: I do too. I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time, but I don't, I believe that they're better now, you know, wh-, B: I think so. I don't think they're shoddy [SEP] hypothesis: they're shoddy	contradiction
premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more. [SEP] hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved	contradiction
premise: A: Have you followed that very much or, B: Uh, not really. I don't think anything will ever take over the NFL. [SEP] hypothesis: something will take over the NFL	contradiction
premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. [SEP] hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked	contradiction
premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B: I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that. [SEP] hypothesis: she has a philosophical problem with that	contradiction
premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important? [SEP] hypothesis: Maelmuire is important	contradiction
premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper? [SEP] hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper	contradiction
premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them? [SEP] hypothesis: people can have power over spirits	contradiction
premise: A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently [SEP] hypothesis: somebody roots differently	contradiction
premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long. [SEP] hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long	contradiction
premise: Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach ``interesting'' and ``novel,'' and ``complementary rather than competitive.'' ``There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds,'' he said. Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops. [SEP] hypothesis: it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops	contradiction
premise: B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either. [SEP] hypothesis: she wants to see that	contradiction
premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else. [SEP] hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else	contradiction
premise: The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland. The two are also signing a trade agreement. South Korean government officials said they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can ``offer experience.'' [SEP] hypothesis: Seoul can loan money to Warsaw	contradiction
premise: B: Well, I was never there for any sentencing. Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day, and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case, and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty, and he would never vote for guilty. A: Huh. B: So, uh, they appointed me jury foreman and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict, [SEP] hypothesis: going in without deliberating allowed them to reach a verdict	contradiction

premise: In finding ``good news'' in Berkeley's new freshman admissions plan (``The Privileged Class,'' editorial, Sept. 20), you're reading the headline but not the story. The plan indeed raises from 40% to 50% the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria. But that doesn't mean ``half of the students attending Berkeley'' will be admitted this way. [SEP] hypothesis: half of the students attending Berkeley will be admitted this way	contradiction
premise: B: What am I afraid of? A: Yes. B: Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know. [SEP] hypothesis: she needs them	contradiction
premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. [SEP] hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever	contradiction
premise: B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all. B: I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive. [SEP] hypothesis: it was a well thought out incentive	contradiction
premise: A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore. [SEP] hypothesis: the Soviet Union itself is a threat still	contradiction
premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way. [SEP] hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. [SEP] hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school	contradiction
premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it, [SEP] hypothesis: they've gone that far	contradiction
premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her. [SEP] hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy	contradiction
premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly. [SEP] hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly	contradiction
premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better [SEP] hypothesis: it could be better	contradiction
premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way [SEP] hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way	contradiction
premise: The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.  But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed. Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap. [SEP] hypothesis: Manhattan comes cheap	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it. [SEP] hypothesis: they can really do something to change it	contradiction
premise: A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that. [SEP] hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone	contradiction
premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down. [SEP] hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down	contradiction
premise: A: It was just a side benefit. B: Yeah, yeah, because, I'm not big or anything, but I'm not in great shape, But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. A: Yeah. B: I don't think women look good with muscles. [SEP] hypothesis: women look good with muscles	contradiction
premise: A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections. And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement. [SEP] hypothesis: they have seen a really high improvement	contradiction
premise: B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing. Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that. [SEP] hypothesis: they should do that	contradiction
premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with [SEP] hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with	contradiction
premise: B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people. [SEP] hypothesis: it would work for probably the majority of people	contradiction
premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. [SEP] hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, [SEP] hypothesis: she would buy a Dodge	contradiction
premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh, [SEP] hypothesis: it should be unanimous	contradiction
premise: A: it was so fattening. B: That sounds good. A: But, I don't think we gained any weight from it [SEP] hypothesis: they gained any weight from it	contradiction
premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no. [SEP] hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future	contradiction
premise: A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody. [SEP] hypothesis: they're going to be serving somebody	contradiction
premise: B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all. [SEP] hypothesis: it was too long	contradiction
premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws. [SEP] hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list	contradiction
premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me. [SEP] hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him	contradiction
premise: A: That is the reason, I don't play over there. B: Yeah. A: I like the course, but I don't play over there because, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart. B: Right. A: And, I don't think a cart damages the turf. [SEP] hypothesis: a cart damages the turf	contradiction
premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right.  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term? [SEP] hypothesis: anything should be done in the short term	neutral
premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected? [SEP] hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected	neutral
premise: Nicky approached her with the assumption that men are naturally right and it is the role of women to follow their lead. Constance, whose confidence was growing daily, was not prepared to give in to Nicky's wishes merely because of his sex. If she felt he was right then she agreed with him. [SEP] hypothesis: Nicky was right	neutral

premise: B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago, but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass [SEP] hypothesis: they had the recycling going on then that they should have now	entailment
premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy. [SEP] hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy	entailment
premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now. [SEP] hypothesis: he's in here	entailment
premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible. [SEP] hypothesis: Everett was missing	entailment
premise: Matthew rode on feeling a little more at peace with himself. He skirted the spruce plantation and supposed that at some point he should tell Sara about it. He could imagine that she might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year. [SEP] hypothesis: Sara might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year	entailment
premise: ``For God's sake keep them in their seats. If we get panic people are going to be crushed to death and there will be mayhem in the car park.''

premise: The city's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.

premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart. [SEP] hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake	entailment
premise: A: Boy that's scary, isn't it. B: Oh, can you imagine, because it happens in the middle of the night, so you know, these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming, let me in. [SEP] hypothesis: the kid was gone	entailment

They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed. [SEP] hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed	entailment
premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride.
