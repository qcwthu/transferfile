premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.

I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way [SEP] hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay.

premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime, [SEP] hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes	contradiction

premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. [SEP] hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it	contradiction
premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her. [SEP] hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy	contradiction

[SEP] hypothesis: the Dodge Omni was a very quality car	contradiction
premise: Meh ' Lindi did not develop the lower set of arms nor the bony, sinuous tail. Too much to expect a new pair of arms to grow out of her ribs, or her coccyx to elongate so enormously.

premise: B: Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess.

[SEP] hypothesis: the Soviet Union itself is a threat still	contradiction
premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done. [SEP] hypothesis: it's done	contradiction

You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere. [SEP] hypothesis: that's done much anywhere	contradiction
premise: B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True.

premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury.

A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year. [SEP] hypothesis: he's going to have to worry about that next year	contradiction

A: Huh. B: So, uh, they appointed me jury foreman and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict, [SEP] hypothesis: going in without deliberating allowed them to reach a verdict	contradiction

But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more. [SEP] hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved	contradiction
premise: A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't, I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing. [SEP] hypothesis: he could stay home all the time and do nothing	contradiction
premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. [SEP] hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did	contradiction

So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia.

premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use.

And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.
