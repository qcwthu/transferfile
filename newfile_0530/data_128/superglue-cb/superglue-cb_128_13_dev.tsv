And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. [SEP] hypothesis: one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools	entailment
premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.

premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate. If you say that a freely-floating body - and the weights would help a bit there because they'd keep it under water and out of any wind - moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots you'd not be far wrong. [SEP] hypothesis: a freely-floating body moves down on the ebb at an average of a bit under two knots	entailment

premise: She longed for a weapon, for even a hairpin, and knowing that she did not have one, she knew too that she was totally defenceless, unarmed and alone. She could feel the great flight of the dragon and sensed that she was high in air and travelling fast towards the sunset.

[SEP] hypothesis: the great muscles of the dragon's wings sent ripplings down the stomach walls	entailment

premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request. [SEP] hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request	entailment

Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk, [SEP] hypothesis: teachers talk	entailment
premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased.

premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him.

[SEP] hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin	entailment
