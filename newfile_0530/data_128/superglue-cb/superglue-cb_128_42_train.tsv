premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly. [SEP] hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly	contradiction
premise: B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way [SEP] hypothesis: the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way	contradiction
premise: A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. [SEP] hypothesis: they should really have to pay for that forever	contradiction
premise: A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that. [SEP] hypothesis: they would have done that	contradiction
premise: A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know, a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to future crime, [SEP] hypothesis: capital punishment would be a deterrent to future crimes	contradiction
premise: Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach ``interesting'' and ``novel,'' and ``complementary rather than competitive.'' ``There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds,'' he said. Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops. [SEP] hypothesis: it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops	contradiction
premise: B: And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. A: That's re-, yeah. B: I'm not saying they read all the right things [SEP] hypothesis: they read all the right things	contradiction
premise: A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too. I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down. [SEP] hypothesis: the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, A: Um. B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B: and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car. [SEP] hypothesis: the Dodge Omni was a very quality car	contradiction
premise: B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big. [SEP] hypothesis: he could really get killed that easily	contradiction
premise: A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh.

[SEP] hypothesis: they would want to go where they used to work	contradiction
premise: B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie. [SEP] hypothesis: he has heard of that movie	contradiction
premise: B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing. Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that. [SEP] hypothesis: they should do that	contradiction
premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to, I mean, I don't think that law will ever change. [SEP] hypothesis: the law will change	contradiction
premise: B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. [SEP] hypothesis: some kid should be exempt from being spanked	contradiction
premise: B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did. [SEP] hypothesis: he and his wife have as much as his parents did	contradiction
premise: B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A: I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it. [SEP] hypothesis: the way she gets the news is the right way to get it	contradiction

premise: A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all. [SEP] hypothesis: that would be bad	contradiction
premise: B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done. [SEP] hypothesis: it's done	contradiction
premise: B: Well, I was never there for any sentencing. Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day, and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case, and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty, and he would never vote for guilty. A: Huh. B: So, uh, they appointed me jury foreman and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict, [SEP] hypothesis: going in without deliberating allowed them to reach a verdict	contradiction
premise: A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah, well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws. [SEP] hypothesis: he checked the topic off on the list	contradiction
premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important? [SEP] hypothesis: Maelmuire is important	contradiction
premise: B: Oh, well that's good. A: but she really doesn't. Nobody thought she would adjust, [SEP] hypothesis: she would adjust	contradiction
premise: A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. [SEP] hypothesis: switching back and forth is that big a deal	contradiction
premise: B: Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess. They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are A: Um. Right. B: you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too. A: Yeah. And I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern, uh, rock and roll, [SEP] hypothesis: she likes a lot of the very modern rock and roll	contradiction
premise: A: That is the reason, I don't play over there. B: Yeah. A: I like the course, but I don't play over there because, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart. B: Right. A: And, I don't think a cart damages the turf. [SEP] hypothesis: a cart damages the turf	contradiction
premise: A: That's fairly interesting. B: I bet that would be, rather interesting. Uh, that's, uh, self improvement, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh. A: Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement. [SEP] hypothesis: she reads anything strictly labeled self improvement	contradiction
premise: A: How do you feel about gun control? B: Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed [SEP] hypothesis: guns should be outlawed	contradiction
premise: B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with [SEP] hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with	contradiction
premise: GM confirmed it received U.S. antitrust clearance to boost its holding. Sansui Electric agreed to sell a 51% stake to Polly Peck of Britain for $110 million. Still, analysts said the accord doesn't suggest Japan is opening up to more foreign takeovers. [SEP] hypothesis: Japan is opening up to more foreign takeovers	contradiction
premise: B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know. I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more. [SEP] hypothesis: a lot of parents are that involved	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, [SEP] hypothesis: she would buy a Dodge	contradiction
premise: A: or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. [SEP] hypothesis: George Bush will make American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week	contradiction
premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask. [SEP] hypothesis: Jed should ask	contradiction
premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them. [SEP] hypothesis: it was Edward's fault	contradiction
premise: B: Well, you've got, well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such, A: Uh-huh. B: And they get out their little Mac tens, they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B: Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it. [SEP] hypothesis: there should be that big of a restriction on it	contradiction
premise: B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long. [SEP] hypothesis: that attitude would stay negative very long	contradiction
premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them? [SEP] hypothesis: people can have power over spirits	contradiction
premise: A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah.

premise: A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better [SEP] hypothesis: it could be better	contradiction
premise: A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue. I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. [SEP] hypothesis: he would blame it directly on the school	contradiction
premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way. [SEP] hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way	contradiction
premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else. [SEP] hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else	contradiction
premise: B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out. [SEP] hypothesis: he has used a typewriter to do a report	contradiction
premise: B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area [SEP] hypothesis: they were in this area	contradiction
premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too. [SEP] hypothesis: Graham was gay too	contradiction
premise: B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it, and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either. [SEP] hypothesis: his mother would want to be there	contradiction
premise: B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long. [SEP] hypothesis: it was too long	contradiction
premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion. [SEP] hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion	contradiction
premise: B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. [SEP] hypothesis: something's going to be done about it	contradiction
premise: The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland. The two are also signing a trade agreement. South Korean government officials said they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can ``offer experience.'' [SEP] hypothesis: Seoul can loan money to Warsaw	contradiction
premise: A: Yeah, that's crazy. B: and then you come here in the Dallas area, um, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles. [SEP] hypothesis: people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles	contradiction
premise: A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh, [SEP] hypothesis: it should be unanimous	contradiction

premise: A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage. [SEP] hypothesis: the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage	contradiction
premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it. [SEP] hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy	contradiction
premise: B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them. [SEP] hypothesis: someone in his house knows the difference	contradiction
premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain. [SEP] hypothesis: Woil was afraid	entailment

[SEP] hypothesis: Sara might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year	entailment
premise: For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise. He could remember that there was an age for puppets and magic just as he could remember the time that he 'd spent trying to fan a deck of cards or sitting in front of a mirror trying to get the hard consonants down like a real ventriloquist. [SEP] hypothesis: there was an age for puppets and magic	entailment
premise: B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television. [SEP] hypothesis: the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television	entailment
premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden. [SEP] hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden	entailment

premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request. [SEP] hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request	entailment

premise: The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London. [SEP] hypothesis: the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London	entailment
premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it? [SEP] hypothesis: they had no way of paying	entailment
premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery?

[SEP] hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains	entailment
premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead. [SEP] hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead	entailment
premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring. [SEP] hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring	entailment
premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed. [SEP] hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed	entailment
premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation. [SEP] hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation	entailment
