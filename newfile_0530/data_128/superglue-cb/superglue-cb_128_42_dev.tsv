B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

premise: B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also.

premise: B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. [SEP] hypothesis: rehabilitation is effective	contradiction

You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere. [SEP] hypothesis: that's done much anywhere	contradiction

B: I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on. [SEP] hypothesis: they educate the jurors enough to really know what's going on	contradiction
premise: B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it, [SEP] hypothesis: they've gone that far	contradiction

premise: The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.  But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed. Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap. [SEP] hypothesis: Manhattan comes cheap	contradiction
premise: B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use.

And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.

B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame [SEP] hypothesis: they feel the closeness that they used to be there	contradiction
premise: B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it [SEP] hypothesis: it was his fault	contradiction
premise: A: Highland Park's thinking about going that route. B: Uh-huh. A: So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.

So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that.

So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A: I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that. [SEP] hypothesis: he would like the KGB monitoring his phone	contradiction
premise: Meh ' Lindi did not develop the lower set of arms nor the bony, sinuous tail. Too much to expect a new pair of arms to grow out of her ribs, or her coccyx to elongate so enormously. Nor could Jaq imagine that she could attain the full strength of a purestrain Stealer - though her own strength was formidable even when unenhanced. [SEP] hypothesis: Meh ' Lindi could attain the full strength of a purestrain Stealer	contradiction

premise: A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems. and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk, [SEP] hypothesis: teachers talk	entailment

premise: At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate.
