This ramp goes into the laundry room (or kitchens/storage spaces) and leads straight down the escalator. (C) [substeps] Generally, four stairs need to hold four adults and seven floors need to hold seven adults. The guidelines aren't too strict, though--not everyone can get across the entire neighborhood on the same stair. (D) [substeps] If a turn is required, make sure it's at least five feet (1.5 meters) square to allow room for the chair. The ramp or path should be built far enough out to have a gentle slope up to the door.

This ramp goes into the laundry room (or kitchens/storage spaces) and leads straight down the escalator. (C) [substeps] Generally, four stairs need to hold four adults and seven floors need to hold seven adults. The guidelines aren't too strict, though--not everyone can get across the entire neighborhood on the same stair. (D) [substeps] If a turn is required, make sure it's at least five feet (1.5 meters) square to allow room for the chair. The ramp or path should be built far enough out to have a gentle slope up to the door.

Even if there is another accessible entrance, making all entrances accessible maximizes the child's safety and gives them the same choices as able-bodied people. (A) [substeps] Choose a ramp that has a secure access point and a safe, accessible stairs, just as you would if you were transporting a normal child to the pediatrician's office or to the emergency room.

This ramp goes into the laundry room (or kitchens/storage spaces) and leads straight down the escalator. (C) [substeps] Generally, four stairs need to hold four adults and seven floors need to hold seven adults. The guidelines aren't too strict, though--not everyone can get across the entire neighborhood on the same stair. (D) [substeps] If a turn is required, make sure it's at least five feet (1.5 meters) square to allow room for the chair. The ramp or path should be built far enough out to have a gentle slope up to the door.

The guidelines aren't too strict, though--not everyone can get across the entire neighborhood on the same stair. (D) [substeps] If a turn is required, make sure it's at least five feet (1.5 meters) square to allow room for the chair. The ramp or path should be built far enough out to have a gentle slope up to the door.
